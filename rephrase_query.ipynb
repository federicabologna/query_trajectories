       " 'tldr': 'When lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enter biological fluids like blood, biomolecules spontaneously adsorb onto their surface forming a \"biomolecular corona.\" This corona fundamentally alters the biological identity and behavior of LNPs, affecting their targeting abilities, cellular interactions, and therapeutic efficacy. (8 sources)',\n",
       " 'text': '\\nUpon administration into the bloodstream, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) undergo a crucial transformation as they interact with various biological components, particularly serum proteins. This interaction results in the rapid formation of a layer of biomolecules surrounding the nanoparticle, known as the \"biomolecular corona\" or more commonly the \"protein corona\" due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This corona formation is a spontaneous process that occurs through non-covalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\\n\\nThe biomolecular corona fundamentally changes the biological identity of LNPs, creating what can be considered a unique \"identification\" that influences how these nanoparticles are recognized by cell receptors <Paper corpusId=\"261886868\" paperTitle=\"(Debnath et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The presence of this corona enveloping the nanoparticle significantly affects how LNPs interact with immune cells and can impact their toxicity profiles and targeting capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"261886868\" paperTitle=\"(Debnath et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This transformation is inevitable - research has shown that complete avoidance of protein corona formation is not feasible, even in PEGylated systems designed to minimize protein adsorption <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3328751\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms underlie the formation of the protein corona, including adsorption and alteration processes <Paper corpusId=\"269803646\" paperTitle=\"(Gao et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These mechanisms determine which specific proteins attach to the LNP surface and how they are arranged, ultimately affecting the LNP\\'s stability, biodistribution patterns, and tissue tropism <Paper corpusId=\"268239296\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, studies have shown that after intravenous administration, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, causing a surface structure change that facilitates apolipoprotein E (apoE) adsorption, which in turn affects endosomal escape and therapeutic payload release <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\\n\\nDespite significant advances in LNP technology, highlighted by their recent clinical successes, our understanding of how LNPs interact with biological components in complex biofluids remains limited. Current knowledge is almost entirely confined to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE), leaving many questions unanswered regarding other potentially important protein-LNP interactions <Paper corpusId=\"269644493\" paperTitle=\"(Simonsen, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanisms through which the biomolecular corona influences tissue- and cell-specific targeting are particularly elusive, largely due to technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media <Paper corpusId=\"268239296\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\\n\\nUnderstanding the protein corona formation process is crucial because it affects many fundamental properties of LNPs, including surface charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, stability, targeting ability, aggregation tendencies, toxicity, efficacy, and even the transfection efficiency of nucleic acid cargo <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266124357\" paperTitle=\"(Epanchintseva et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.',\n",

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands.

       "   'snippets': ['When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo.'],\n",
