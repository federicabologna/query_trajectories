                    "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

                    "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

Understanding of biodistribution and liver-specific tropism\n# Venue: Molecular Therapy: Methods & Clinical Development\n# Authors: M. Hosseini-Kharat, K. Bremmell, C. Prestidge\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\n2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17\n\n## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIVER CELL TYPES AND LNPs\nECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample.

Despite its powerful promises as a drug, siRNA requires a sophisticated delivery vehicle because of its rapid degradation in the circulation, inefficient accumulation in target tissues and inability to cross cell membranes to access the cytoplasm where it functions. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) containing ionizable amino lipids is the leading delivery technology for siRNA, with five products in clinical trials and more in the pipeline. Here, we focus on the technological advances behind these potent systems for siRNA-mediated gene silencing.",

                    "text": "Neutral liposomes have been shown to bind to proteins in serum, exchange components with lipoproteins and acquire factors that can potentially target them to specific cell types [45,46]. In particular, they interact with apolipoprotein (Apo) E and A-I [47,48]. ApoE, but not ApoA-I or ApoA-IV, was further found to enhance uptake of neutral liposomes in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes [49]. The role of ApoE in LNP uptake into hepatocytes was confirmed in vivo using ApoE-deficient mice [50]. The authors demonstrated that LNP were cleared more slowly from the circulation and were taken up by hepatocytes at least 20-fold less in ApoE-deficient mice than in wild-type animals. Similarly, LNP siRNA systems containing ionizable lipids require ApoE for activity [51]. Silencing of Factor VII was compromised in mice lacking ApoE or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, suggesting that ApoE acts as an endogenous ligand for LNP siRNA systems that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor. \n\nWhen endogenous ligands are not available, exogenous ligands can be used to enhance uptake of LNP siRNA systems in target cells. Exogenous ligands such as antibodies, antibody fragments and peptides have been widely used in the field of liposome technology [52][53][54][55]. However, they are expensive and difficult to manufacture, as well as potentially immunogenic. In contrast, small molecule ligands conjugated to the distal end of PEG-lipids are simple to synthesize and can be formulated into LNP in a straightforward manner (Figure 2) [51,56,57]. N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) found on hepatocytes, have been shown to rescue gene-silencing activity of LNP siRNA systems in ApoE deficient mice [51].",

Cullis\n## Abstract\nTechnological advances in both siRNA (small interfering RNA) and whole genome sequencing have demonstrated great potential in translating genetic information into siRNA-based drugs to halt the synthesis of most disease-causing proteins. Despite its powerful promises as a drug, siRNA requires a sophisticated delivery vehicle because of its rapid degradation in the circulation, inefficient accumulation in target tissues and inability to cross cell membranes to access the cytoplasm where it functions. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) containing ionizable amino lipids is the leading delivery technology for siRNA, with five products in clinical trials and more in the pipeline. Here, we focus on the technological advances behind these potent systems for siRNA-mediated gene silencing.\n## Cellular Uptake: Endogenous and Exogenous Targeting Ligands\nNeutral liposomes have been shown to bind to proteins in serum, exchange components with lipoproteins and acquire factors that can potentially target them to specific cell types [45,46]. In particular, they interact with apolipoprotein (Apo) E and A-I [47,48]. ApoE, but not ApoA-I or ApoA-IV, was further found to enhance uptake of neutral liposomes in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes [49]. The role of ApoE in LNP uptake into hepatocytes was confirmed in vivo using ApoE-deficient mice [50]. The authors demonstrated that LNP were cleared more slowly from the circulation and were taken up by hepatocytes at least 20-fold less in ApoE-deficient mice than in wild-type animals. Similarly, LNP siRNA systems containing ionizable lipids require ApoE for activity [51]. Silencing of Factor VII was compromised in mice lacking ApoE or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, suggesting that ApoE acts as an endogenous ligand for LNP siRNA systems that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor. \n\nWhen endogenous ligands are not available, exogenous ligands can be used to enhance uptake of LNP siRNA systems in target cells. Exogenous ligands such as antibodies, antibody fragments and peptides have been widely used in the field of liposome technology [52][53][54][55]. However, they are expensive and difficult to manufacture, as well as potentially immunogenic. In contrast, small molecule ligands conjugated to the distal end of PEG-lipids are simple to synthesize and can be formulated into LNP in a straightforward manner (Figure 2) [51,56,57]. N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) found on hepatocytes, have been shown to rescue gene-silencing activity of LNP siRNA systems in ApoE deficient mice [51].",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

The development of a protein corona affects the chemical and physical characteristics of LNPs, increasing the hydrodynamic diameter and modifying the charge on the surface. Nevertheless, all protein coronas contained different patterns of proteins related with the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and the transport capacity, to modulate, in diverse ways, LNP-cell interactions [116]. The initial physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface properties, composition, and structure, predominantly determine the biological fate of LNPs within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine. Notably, LNPs can be categorized as either digestible or indigestible based on their composition, resulting in two distinct biological paths for LNPs. Digestible LNPs undergo digestion initiated by lipases and subsequent hydrolysis across the GI tract upon ingestion. This process leads to the breakdown of lipids, resulting in lipid digestion products rich in fatty acids and monoglycerides. These products, along with encapsulated drugs, bile salts, and phospholipids, form mixed micelles. After absorption by enterocytes, these lipid digestion products and encapsulated drugs enter the systemic circulation through either the portal vein or the lymphatic system. The specific route taken depends on the lipid structure within the LNP formulation and the hydrophobic nature of the encapsulated drugs. Alternatively, indigestible LNPs can remain intact and potentially penetrate the mucus layer to reach epithelial surfaces. After penetration, these LNPs can be transported through the tight junction, or absorbed up by enterocytes or transported by M cells, to enter the circulation [117].",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

                    "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "abstract": "RNA-based therapeutics have shown great promise in various medical applications, including cancers, infectious diseases, and metabolic diseases. The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

                    "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Chemical Structures of vectors\nUpon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.\n\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

However, NP interactions with and effects on biomolecules and organisms have only recently been addressed. Within we review the literature regarding proposed modes of action for metal and metal-oxide NPs, two of the most prevalent types manufactured. Iron-oxide NPs, for instance, are used as tracers for magnetic resonance imaging of oncological tumors and as vehicles for therapeutic drug delivery. Factors and theories that determine the physicochemical and biokinetic behaviors of NPs are discussed, along with the observed toxicological effects of NPs on cells. Key thermodynamic and kinetic models that explain the sources of energy transfer from NPs to biological targets are summarized, in addition to quantitative structural activity relationship (QSAR) modeling efforts. Future challenges for nanotoxicological research are discussed. We conclude that NP studies based on cell culture are often inconsistent and underestimate the toxicity of NPs. Thus, the effect of NPs needs to be examined in whole animal systems.",

                    "text": "However, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells. For example, coronas with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have increased access to the brain [24]. Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE [29]. In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain [14]. Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs [14]. \n\nIn recent in vitro studies, the critical role of serum concentration as a primary modulator of toxicity to NPs has been documented. High serum protein concentrations allow for protein attachment to hard coronas, which shields cells from immediate damage after engulfment of NPs [30,31]. In vivo serum concentrations are 10 to 50-fold higher than those used in cell culture (2%-10%, approximately 4 mg/mL) [30]. Thus, NP targeting of cells in culture is not necessarily reproducible in vivo [32]. In one example, the cytotoxic effects of NPs on A549 (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial) cells decreased with increasing concentrations of serum, from 4 to 40 mg/mL. Cytoxicity was evaluated based on cell death and decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels. The highest concentrations of serum fully protected A549 cells from NP toxicity [32]. The same investigators in related studies with lower concentrations of serum determined that NPs induce damage in a variety of different cell types via apparently similar mechanisms [30][31][32][33]. Endocytosis of NPs leads to degradation of the hard corona and exposure of NP-ligand surfaces in the lysosome.",

Teske, C. Detweiler\n## Abstract\nHumans are increasingly exposed to nanoparticles (NPs) in medicine and in industrial settings, where significant concentrations of NPs are common. However, NP interactions with and effects on biomolecules and organisms have only recently been addressed. Within we review the literature regarding proposed modes of action for metal and metal-oxide NPs, two of the most prevalent types manufactured. Iron-oxide NPs, for instance, are used as tracers for magnetic resonance imaging of oncological tumors and as vehicles for therapeutic drug delivery. Factors and theories that determine the physicochemical and biokinetic behaviors of NPs are discussed, along with the observed toxicological effects of NPs on cells. Key thermodynamic and kinetic models that explain the sources of energy transfer from NPs to biological targets are summarized, in addition to quantitative structural activity relationship (QSAR) modeling efforts. Future challenges for nanotoxicological research are discussed. We conclude that NP studies based on cell culture are often inconsistent and underestimate the toxicity of NPs. Thus, the effect of NPs needs to be examined in whole animal systems.\n## Protein Coronas form on NPs in vivo and Have Both Beneficial and Adverse Effects\nHowever, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells. For example, coronas with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have increased access to the brain [24]. Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE [29]. In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain [14]. Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs [14]. \n\nIn recent in vitro studies, the critical role of serum concentration as a primary modulator of toxicity to NPs has been documented. High serum protein concentrations allow for protein attachment to hard coronas, which shields cells from immediate damage after engulfment of NPs [30,31]. In vivo serum concentrations are 10 to 50-fold higher than those used in cell culture (2%-10%, approximately 4 mg/mL) [30]. Thus, NP targeting of cells in culture is not necessarily reproducible in vivo [32]. In one example, the cytotoxic effects of NPs on A549 (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial) cells decreased with increasing concentrations of serum, from 4 to 40 mg/mL. Cytoxicity was evaluated based on cell death and decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels. The highest concentrations of serum fully protected A549 cells from NP toxicity [32]. The same investigators in related studies with lower concentrations of serum determined that NPs induce damage in a variety of different cell types via apparently similar mechanisms [30][31][32][33]. Endocytosis of NPs leads to degradation of the hard corona and exposure of NP-ligand surfaces in the lysosome.",

Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

Karve, Frank DeRosa\n## Abstract\nRational design and robust formulation processes are critical for optimal delivery of mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.\n## \u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor both IV and IM dosing, LNPs made with lipids A and B, irrespective of the helper lipids used, showed significantly higher hEPO levels over the MC3 control (p < 0.005, Figure 2A\u2212D). For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

Overcoming challenges in safe and effective mRNA delivery to target tissues and cells, along with controlling release from the delivery vehicle, remains pivotal in mRNA-based therapies. This review elucidates the structure of LNPs, the mechanism for mRNA delivery, and the targeted delivery of LNPs to various cells and tissues, including leukocytes, T-cells, dendritic cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic endothelial cells, and hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. Here, we discuss the applications of mRNA\u2013LNP vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases and for the treatment of cancer and various genetic diseases. Although challenges remain in terms of delivery efficiency, specific tissue targeting, toxicity, and storage stability, mRNA\u2013LNP technology holds extensive potential for the treatment of diseases.\n## Tissue-Specific Targeting\nBy adjusting the ratio of lipids in LNPs, the targeting ability of LNPs to different organs can be tailored. Siegwart et al. [62] discovered that modifying the composition and components of LNPs allows for the selective targeting of organs. These passively targeted LNPs are termed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, facilitating controlled nucleic acid delivery to specific tissues. Lung-targeting SORT LNPs feature a notably different protein corona from liver-targeting LNPs, with a reduced enrichment of ApoE, complement components, and immunoglobulins as well as increased enrichment of vitronectin (Vtn) among other proteins [63] (Figure 4). SORT LNPs contain SORT molecules and can accurately regulate delivery to the mouse liver, lungs, and spleen after intravenous injection [64] (Table 2). Siegwart et al. [65] conducted an exploration of the targeted mechanism of SORT LNPs. They speculated that different SORT molecules may cause LNPs to absorb different plasma proteins, thereby achieving tissue-specific mRNA delivery. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona of different SORT LNPs revealed that the main proteins adsorbed by LNPs from the liver, lungs, and spleen were apolipoprotein E (apoE), vitronectin, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I, respectively.

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successful in delivering nucleic acids like siRNA and mRNA, but face challenges in protein delivery due to limited protein encapsulation and endosome escape. In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.",

                    "text": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking. After intravenous administration, serum ApoE usually binds onto LNPs, leading to liver accumulation of the nanoparticles. [40,42,43] Albumin is the most abundant proteins in the serum and was reported to affect the endocytosis pathways and intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles. [41] Previous studies have shown that albumin-coated nanoparticles preferentially bind to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18 on the cell surface and promote endocytosis via caveola-mediated or micropinocytosis-related pathways. [44,45] We found that the GFP delivery efficacy of LNPs increases with increasing albumin concentrations, but is scarcely influenced by ApoE, suggesting that albumin plays a crucial role in LNPs mediated protein delivery in serum-containing media (Figure 3c). The addition of fucoidan, a gp30 and gp18 inhibitor, dramatically inhibited the intracellular delivery of GFP by LNPs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that endocytosis of GFP-loaded LNPs depends on albumin receptors (Figure 3e). We further investigated the cell internalization pathways of GFP-loaded LNPs using different endocytosis inhibitors in the presence and absence of 10% FBS. The LNPs were internalized through multiple pathways, such as macropinocytosis-, lipid raft-, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis in serum-free medium (Figure S7, Supporting Information). However, the internalization of nanoparticles in the serumcontaining medium was only inhibited by genistein (Geni), a caveola-dependent endocytosis inhibitor (Figure 3d,f). Besides Geni, the uptake of GFP-loaded LNP is also inhibited by filipin III (a cholesterol depletion agent), digitonin (a cholesterol depletion agent), and brefeldin A (BFA, a caveola-disrupting agent and caveosome trafficking inhibitor).",

In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.\n## Mechanisms of LNPs in Protein Delivery\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking. After intravenous administration, serum ApoE usually binds onto LNPs, leading to liver accumulation of the nanoparticles. [40,42,43] Albumin is the most abundant proteins in the serum and was reported to affect the endocytosis pathways and intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles. [41] Previous studies have shown that albumin-coated nanoparticles preferentially bind to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18 on the cell surface and promote endocytosis via caveola-mediated or micropinocytosis-related pathways. [44,45] We found that the GFP delivery efficacy of LNPs increases with increasing albumin concentrations, but is scarcely influenced by ApoE, suggesting that albumin plays a crucial role in LNPs mediated protein delivery in serum-containing media (Figure 3c). The addition of fucoidan, a gp30 and gp18 inhibitor, dramatically inhibited the intracellular delivery of GFP by LNPs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that endocytosis of GFP-loaded LNPs depends on albumin receptors (Figure 3e). We further investigated the cell internalization pathways of GFP-loaded LNPs using different endocytosis inhibitors in the presence and absence of 10% FBS. The LNPs were internalized through multiple pathways, such as macropinocytosis-, lipid raft-, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis in serum-free medium (Figure S7, Supporting Information). However, the internalization of nanoparticles in the serumcontaining medium was only inhibited by genistein (Geni), a caveola-dependent endocytosis inhibitor (Figure 3d,f). Besides Geni, the uptake of GFP-loaded LNP is also inhibited by filipin III (a cholesterol depletion agent), digitonin (a cholesterol depletion agent), and brefeldin A (BFA, a caveola-disrupting agent and caveosome trafficking inhibitor).",

To investigate the intracellular routing of recycling apoE, primary hepatocyte cultures from LDL receptor-deficient mice and mice deficient in receptor-associated protein [a model of depressed expression of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP)] were incubated with human VLDL containing 125I-labeled human recombinant apoE3. Approximately 30% of the internalized intact apoE was recycled after 4 h. The N-terminal 22 kDa fragment of apoE was also resecreted, demonstrating that this apoE domain contains sufficient sequence to recycle. The 22 kDa fragment has reduced affinity for lipoproteins, suggesting that apoE recycling is linked to the ability of apoE to bind directly to a recycling receptor. Finally, apoE was found to recycle equally well in the presence of brefeldin A, a drug that blocks transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and leads to collapse of the Golgi stacks. Our studies demonstrate that apoE recycling occurs 1) in the absence of the LDL receptor or under conditions of markedly reduced LRP expression; 2) when apoE lacks the carboxyl-terminal domain, which allows binding to the lipoprotein; and 3) in the absence of an intact Golgi apparatus. We conclude that apoE recycling occurs through multiple redundant pathways.",

                    "text": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34 kDa protein with functions in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and intracellular lipid disposal. Extracellularly, apoE is a key mediator of the internalization of lipoprotein particles, serving as a ligand for the LDL receptor (1,2) and the LDL receptorrelated protein (LRP) (3,4). ApoE is also internalized by binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) alone (5,6) or via a mechanism involving both HSPGs and LRP (7,8). Intracellularly, apoE modulates lipid metabolism (9,10) and functions in the routing of internalized lipoprotein remnants (11,12). In addition, it is involved in both the assembly (13,14) and secretion (15,16) of VLDLs. ApoE also plays a critical role in cholesterol efflux from macrophages (17)(18)(19)(20), a role that could be due to both intracellular and extracellular effects. Because apoE can easily transfer between lipoproteins and binds tightly to its receptors, we and others hypothesized and proved that a substantial amount of internalized apoE escapes lysosomal degradation and is routed into the secretory pathway. \n\nWe have established that a portion of apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, as well as on HDL, is spared degradation and recycled (21)(22)(23). We also demonstrated that internalized apoE is found in the media of hepatocyte cultures from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow (22), a proof that systemic apoE can be retained by the liver cell and is eventually regurgitated. In addition, we reported that apoE was resecreted from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea hepatocytes after incubation with apoEcontaining mouse VLDL (23). The fact that apoA-I stimulated apoE resecretion from hepatocytes suggests a role for recycling apoE in HDL metabolism (23).",

Farkas, K. Weisgraber, V. Shepherd, M. Linton, S. Fazio, L. Swift\n## Abstract\nA portion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) internalized by hepatocytes is spared degradation and is recycled. To investigate the intracellular routing of recycling apoE, primary hepatocyte cultures from LDL receptor-deficient mice and mice deficient in receptor-associated protein [a model of depressed expression of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP)] were incubated with human VLDL containing 125I-labeled human recombinant apoE3. Approximately 30% of the internalized intact apoE was recycled after 4 h. The N-terminal 22 kDa fragment of apoE was also resecreted, demonstrating that this apoE domain contains sufficient sequence to recycle. The 22 kDa fragment has reduced affinity for lipoproteins, suggesting that apoE recycling is linked to the ability of apoE to bind directly to a recycling receptor. Finally, apoE was found to recycle equally well in the presence of brefeldin A, a drug that blocks transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and leads to collapse of the Golgi stacks. Our studies demonstrate that apoE recycling occurs 1) in the absence of the LDL receptor or under conditions of markedly reduced LRP expression; 2) when apoE lacks the carboxyl-terminal domain, which allows binding to the lipoprotein; and 3) in the absence of an intact Golgi apparatus. We conclude that apoE recycling occurs through multiple redundant pathways.\n## body\nApolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34 kDa protein with functions in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and intracellular lipid disposal. Extracellularly, apoE is a key mediator of the internalization of lipoprotein particles, serving as a ligand for the LDL receptor (1,2) and the LDL receptorrelated protein (LRP) (3,4). ApoE is also internalized by binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) alone (5,6) or via a mechanism involving both HSPGs and LRP (7,8). Intracellularly, apoE modulates lipid metabolism (9,10) and functions in the routing of internalized lipoprotein remnants (11,12). In addition, it is involved in both the assembly (13,14) and secretion (15,16) of VLDLs. ApoE also plays a critical role in cholesterol efflux from macrophages (17)(18)(19)(20), a role that could be due to both intracellular and extracellular effects. Because apoE can easily transfer between lipoproteins and binds tightly to its receptors, we and others hypothesized and proved that a substantial amount of internalized apoE escapes lysosomal degradation and is routed into the secretory pathway. \n\nWe have established that a portion of apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, as well as on HDL, is spared degradation and recycled (21)(22)(23). We also demonstrated that internalized apoE is found in the media of hepatocyte cultures from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow (22), a proof that systemic apoE can be retained by the liver cell and is eventually regurgitated. In addition, we reported that apoE was resecreted from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea hepatocytes after incubation with apoEcontaining mouse VLDL (23). The fact that apoA-I stimulated apoE resecretion from hepatocytes suggests a role for recycling apoE in HDL metabolism (23).",

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ].

Pilkington, Estelle J A Suys, Natalie L. Trevaskis, A. Wheatley, Danijela Zukancic, Azizah Algarni, Hareth Al-Wassiti, T. Davis, C. Pouton, S. Kent, N. Truong\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Targeting extralymphatic organs and tissues\nmg/kg mRNA dose, iPhos lipid-containing LNPs consisting of a single tertiary amine and phosphate group with three alkyl tails demonstrated the highest efficacy, with alkyl chain length playing a key role in organ selectivity and functional mRNA delivery: at the amine side, 8-10 carbons facilitated high mRNA expression; at the phosphate side, translation was directed to the liver, where chains were under 12 carbons versus longer chains localized to the spleen. Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity.",

To evaluate whether the ratio of albumin and ApoE would affect cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of these LNPs, LNPs were prelabeled with fluorescent dye (either with rhod-PE on the lipid particles or with Cy5-mRNA) and cultured in a proteinsupplemented media. In serum-free media, cellular uptake remained the same for all three LNPs (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8); whereas in serum-containing media, the hepatocytes uptake of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs was significantly increased as compared with A6 LNPs (Fig. 2d). By treating hepatocytes with LNPs incubated in an albumin-rich or ApoE solution (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8), we demonstrated that albumin plays a key role in the cellular uptake of cKK-E12 containing LNPs. Previous work has described ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of siRNA LNPs, however, in our case the role of ApoE is less significant. This could be due to either saturation of ApoE secretion from hepatocytes masking LNP-mediated ApoE uptake effects, or the intrinsic difference between mRNA and siRNA LNP formulations 24,25 . Therefore, we hypothesize that LNPs coated with serum albumin may facilitate the delivery of mRNA to the liver via an ApoE \"independent\" pathway. \n\nTo further evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the protein expression of cKK-E12, A6, and Syn-3 LNPs containing Fluc mRNA in primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of albumin, ApoE, or serum. Consistent with the uptake study and studies using ionizable LNPs 11,25 , protein expression with the A6 mRNA LNP was found to be independent of albumin or serum, but significantly enhanced by ApoE (Fig. 2e-g).",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

Anderson\n## Abstract\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LNPs) have potential as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA therapies. However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity.\n## Results\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, Student's T-test comparing to cKK-E12 group. \n\nparticle size measurements; the average diameter of LNPs increased ~20 nm after incubation with mouse serum for 1 h (Table 2. Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.\n...\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake. To evaluate whether the ratio of albumin and ApoE would affect cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of these LNPs, LNPs were prelabeled with fluorescent dye (either with rhod-PE on the lipid particles or with Cy5-mRNA) and cultured in a proteinsupplemented media. In serum-free media, cellular uptake remained the same for all three LNPs (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8); whereas in serum-containing media, the hepatocytes uptake of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs was significantly increased as compared with A6 LNPs (Fig. 2d). By treating hepatocytes with LNPs incubated in an albumin-rich or ApoE solution (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8), we demonstrated that albumin plays a key role in the cellular uptake of cKK-E12 containing LNPs. Previous work has described ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of siRNA LNPs, however, in our case the role of ApoE is less significant. This could be due to either saturation of ApoE secretion from hepatocytes masking LNP-mediated ApoE uptake effects, or the intrinsic difference between mRNA and siRNA LNP formulations 24,25 . Therefore, we hypothesize that LNPs coated with serum albumin may facilitate the delivery of mRNA to the liver via an ApoE \"independent\" pathway. \n\nTo further evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the protein expression of cKK-E12, A6, and Syn-3 LNPs containing Fluc mRNA in primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of albumin, ApoE, or serum. Consistent with the uptake study and studies using ionizable LNPs 11,25 , protein expression with the A6 mRNA LNP was found to be independent of albumin or serum, but significantly enhanced by ApoE (Fig. 2e-g).\n...\nConsistent with the uptake study and studies using ionizable LNPs 11,25 , protein expression with the A6 mRNA LNP was found to be independent of albumin or serum, but significantly enhanced by ApoE (Fig. 2e-g). On the contrary, for cKK-E12 LNPs or Syn-3 LNPs, increasing the concentration of ApoE in the media slightly enhanced gene expression (Fig. 2e-g) whereas increasing the concentration of serum and albumin dramatically increased gene expression 4-5-fold (Fig. 2e, f). \n\nTo further investigate the interaction between albumin and LNPs, the thermodynamics of albumin adsorption on LNP surfaces was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Although, a relatively weak interaction was observed for both cKK-E12 LNPs and A6 LNPs with human albumin (HSA) 26,27 , HSA adsorbed on cKK-E12 LNPs (Kd: 5.7 \u03bcM) demonstrated a 5-fold higher association constant as compared with A6 LNPs (Kd: 24.4 \u03bcM). The enthalpy of HSA binding to CKK-E12 LNPs (926 kcal/mol) was 2-fold higher than A6 LNPs (489 kcal/mol) (Fig. 2h). \n\nPrevious studies have shown that albumin-like moieties, including albumin-NPs, can bind preferentially to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18. This interaction facilitates endocytosis via the caveolae mediated pathway or via macropinocytosis 28 . To test whether our LNPs were internalized via an albumin-mediated pathway following albumin coating, we evaluated several cellular internalization pathways. We depleted key endocytic regulators using siRNA in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2i), and delivered our LNPs.",

Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016).

This is where the LNP delivery technology comes into play. Upon administration, proteins and other biological components present in the extracellular space can bind at the surface of the mRNA LNPs. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid stabilizing the mRNA LNP system against aggregation during manufacturing and storage contains short acyl chains. This design facilitates that the PEGlipid rapidly dissociates from the LNP following injection, as an essential first step to allow cellular interactions [38,39]. Upon intravenous administration, Akinc et al. found that the surface of neutrally-charged LNPs is strongly enriched with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which leads to enhanced uptake by hepatocytes through low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [40]. There are good reasons to believe that ApoE binding also plays a critical role in the uptake of the mRNA LNP vaccines after intramuscular injection. Vaccine targeted cell types (see Mode of action), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, highly express LDL receptors and other scavenger receptors [41]. Moreover, the transfection of human DCs with mRNA LNPs in an in vitro setting was also reported to be promoted in the presence of ApoE [42]. Upon internalization, mRNA LNPs are routed through the endo-lysosomal compartment, where most of the mRNA LNPs remain entrapped in endosomes and degrade over time. The intracellular trafficking and underlying mechanisms on how LNPs enable the escape of mRNA from the endosomes to reach the cytoplasm are still not fully understood [43][44][45].

De Smedt, H. Dewitte\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Delivery system\nHow much protein will be produced from the mRNA template will initially be determined by the amount of intact mRNA that reaches the cytosolic compartment. This is where the LNP delivery technology comes into play. Upon administration, proteins and other biological components present in the extracellular space can bind at the surface of the mRNA LNPs. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid stabilizing the mRNA LNP system against aggregation during manufacturing and storage contains short acyl chains. This design facilitates that the PEGlipid rapidly dissociates from the LNP following injection, as an essential first step to allow cellular interactions [38,39]. Upon intravenous administration, Akinc et al. found that the surface of neutrally-charged LNPs is strongly enriched with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which leads to enhanced uptake by hepatocytes through low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [40]. There are good reasons to believe that ApoE binding also plays a critical role in the uptake of the mRNA LNP vaccines after intramuscular injection.

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a viable, clinically-validated platform for the delivery of mRNA therapeutics. LNPs have been utilized as mRNA delivery systems for applications including vaccines, gene therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. However, LNPs, which are typically composed of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol, often traffic to the liver which limits the therapeutic potential of the platform. Several approaches have been proposed to resolve this tropism such as post-synthesis surface modification or the addition of synthetic cationic lipids. Methods: Here, we present a strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of mRNA involving the incorporation of bile acids, a naturally-occurring class of cholesterol analogs, during LNP synthesis. We synthesized a series of bile acid-containing C14-4 LNPs by replacing cholesterol with bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid) at various ratios. Results: Bile acid-containing LNPs (BA-LNPs) were able to reduce delivery to liver cells in vitro and improve delivery in a variety of other cell types, including T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells. Our subsequent in vivo screening of selected LNP candidates injected intraperitoneally or intravenously identified a highly spleen tropic BA-LNP: CA-100, a four-component LNP containing cholic acid and no cholesterol. These screens also identified BA-LNP candidates demonstrating promise for other mRNA therapeutic applications such as for gastrointestinal or immune cell delivery. We further found that the substitution of cholic acid for cholesterol in an LNP formulation utilizing a different ionizable lipid, C12-200, also shifted mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen, suggesting that this cholic acid replacement strategy may be generalizable. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of a four-component BA-LNP formulation, CA-100, for extrahepatic mRNA delivery that could potentially be utilized for a range of therapeutic and vaccine applications.",

Billingsley, Alvin J. Mukalel, Ajay S. Thatte, Alex G. Hamilton, Ningqiang Gong, Rakan El-Mayta, Hannah C. Safford, Maria I. Merolle, Michael J. Mitchell\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a viable, clinically-validated platform for the delivery of mRNA therapeutics. LNPs have been utilized as mRNA delivery systems for applications including vaccines, gene therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. However, LNPs, which are typically composed of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol, often traffic to the liver which limits the therapeutic potential of the platform. Several approaches have been proposed to resolve this tropism such as post-synthesis surface modification or the addition of synthetic cationic lipids. Methods: Here, we present a strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of mRNA involving the incorporation of bile acids, a naturally-occurring class of cholesterol analogs, during LNP synthesis. We synthesized a series of bile acid-containing C14-4 LNPs by replacing cholesterol with bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid) at various ratios. Results: Bile acid-containing LNPs (BA-LNPs) were able to reduce delivery to liver cells in vitro and improve delivery in a variety of other cell types, including T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells. Our subsequent in vivo screening of selected LNP candidates injected intraperitoneally or intravenously identified a highly spleen tropic BA-LNP: CA-100, a four-component LNP containing cholic acid and no cholesterol. These screens also identified BA-LNP candidates demonstrating promise for other mRNA therapeutic applications such as for gastrointestinal or immune cell delivery. We further found that the substitution of cholic acid for cholesterol in an LNP formulation utilizing a different ionizable lipid, C12-200, also shifted mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen, suggesting that this cholic acid replacement strategy may be generalizable. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of a four-component BA-LNP formulation, CA-100, for extrahepatic mRNA delivery that could potentially be utilized for a range of therapeutic and vaccine applications.\n## Biodistribution of BA-LNPs following intravenous injection\nThough IP injection of mRNA-LNPs is a desirable strategy for certain clinical applications, we wanted to explore the biodistribution of the BA-LNPs following IV administration to evaluate their ability to serve as delivery vehicles for mRNA therapeutics that require the rapid onset and predictable pharmacological profile of IV administration for maximum therapeutic effect [51].However, intravenous injection poses its own problems for mRNA and nanotherapeutics as blood maintains an enzymatic environment that also induces degradation.\n\nFurthermore, plasma proteins such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) are known to bind to LNPs, form a protein corona, and drive receptor-mediated uptake in the liver which limits delivery to extrahepatic organs [52].Notably, cholesterol plays an important role in enabling the formation of a protein corona [53].Therefore, since our selected bile acid-containing LNPs lack or have reduced levels of cholesterol, we hypothesized that the protein corona and subsequent corona-mediated uptake may be altered.To assess the biodistribution of our selected bile acid-containing LNP candidates, we intravenously injected these LNPs and a control LNP (S2, CA-100, DCA-50, and LCA-75) encapsulating luciferaseencoding mRNA into mice.Organs of the peritoneal cavity in addition to the heart and lungs, were dissected after 6 hours and evaluated for luminescence using IVIS (Figure 5A).Though some increased mRNA delivery was observed in all the organs using BA-LNPs as compared to the S2 LNPs, luminescent expression in both the liver and spleen is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than all other harvested organs for most LNP candidates.Thus, most of the results explored further here focus on delivery in these two organs.\n\nThough all tested LNPs led to delivery primarily to the spleen and liver, each LNP formulation displayed different distributional patterns in this delivery.CA-100, the same LNP that improved spleen delivery following IP injection, significantly reduced luminescence in the liver and increased luminescence in the spleen relative to S2 (Figure 5B).",

Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer.

The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## Liver Accumulation\nOne major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105].

The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site.

                    "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Ionizable lipids may be essential for cellular internalization of LNPs\nWhether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

However, the effective delivery of these RNA therapeutics remains a major challenge due to their large size, negative charge, and susceptibility to degradation. Aim: This review aims to explore advanced drug delivery systems developed to enhance the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on both viral and non-viral methods, and to evaluate the progress and limitations of these systems in clinical applications. Methods: The review synthesizes recent advancements in RNA delivery technologies, including viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid systems. It also examines various targeting strategies such as passive and active targeting to improve the specificity and efficiency of RNA delivery. Results: Significant progress has been made with both viral and non-viral delivery systems. Viral vectors, though effective, face challenges related to immunogenicity and production costs. Non-viral systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based carriers, have shown promising results, with several FDA-approved products demonstrating clinical efficacy. Advances in targeting strategies, including ligand-based and antibody-based methods, have improved the precision of RNA delivery.",

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

A. Almansour, Mubarak Saad Aldosary, Maysam Taysir Almegbel, S. Alsubaie, Ahlam Mohammed Alzahrani\n## Abstract\nBackground: RNA-based therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), offer significant promise in treating genetic and acquired diseases by targeting specific RNA sequences, encoding therapeutic proteins, or facilitating genome editing. However, the effective delivery of these RNA therapeutics remains a major challenge due to their large size, negative charge, and susceptibility to degradation. Aim: This review aims to explore advanced drug delivery systems developed to enhance the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on both viral and non-viral methods, and to evaluate the progress and limitations of these systems in clinical applications. Methods: The review synthesizes recent advancements in RNA delivery technologies, including viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid systems. It also examines various targeting strategies such as passive and active targeting to improve the specificity and efficiency of RNA delivery. Results: Significant progress has been made with both viral and non-viral delivery systems. Viral vectors, though effective, face challenges related to immunogenicity and production costs. Non-viral systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based carriers, have shown promising results, with several FDA-approved products demonstrating clinical efficacy. Advances in targeting strategies, including ligand-based and antibody-based methods, have improved the precision of RNA delivery.\n## Lipids and Lipid-Based Nanoparticles (LNPs):\nx o Protein Corona: When nanoparticles enter the bloodstream, they quickly adsorb proteins, forming a \"corona\" that modifies their behavior. For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

Abstract Advances in the using in vitro transcribed (IVT) modRNA in the past two decades, especially the tremendous recent success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, have brought increased attention to IVT mRNA technology. Despite its well-known use in infectious disease vaccines, IVT modRNA technology is being investigated mainly in cancer immunotherapy and protein replacement therapy, with ongoing clinical trials in both areas. One of the main barriers to progressing mRNA therapeutics to the clinic is determining how to deliver mRNA to target cells and protect it from degradation. Over the years, many different vehicles have been developed to tackle this issue. Desirable vehicles must be safe, stable and preferably organ specific for successful mRNA delivery to clinically relevant cells and tissues. In this review we discuss various mRNA delivery platforms, with particular focus on attempts to create organ-specific vehicles for therapeutic mRNA delivery.",

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been shown to bind to intravenously injected LNPs. Crucial to transporting and metabolizing lipids, ApoE regulates lipoprotein and cholesterol levels in the plasma via high-affinity binding to the family of LDL receptors [70,71]. The liver is the main organ for clearing ApoE-binding lipoproteins; hence, systemically delivered LNPs would bind ApoE and preferentially home to the liver [36,72]. A study performed on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice using cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA demonstrated that the hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs is ApoE dependent, suggesting that LNP charge plays a role in LNP tissue tropism [73]. \n\nWhile excessive liver homing is a notable disadvantage of intravenously injected ionizable LNPs, a selective organ targeting (SORT) strategy could overcome this issue [74]. In this system, various lipid classes were designed for tissue-specific gene delivery and editing using CRISPR-Cas technology. Based on previous work, researchers speculated that the key to organ-specific delivery would be manipulating the internal and/or external charge of formulated LNPs [75][76][77]. Along with standard LNP components including an ionizable cationic lipid, phospholipids, cholesterol and PEG, the authors proposed adding SORT molecules which allow lung-, spleen-or liver-specific gene delivery. Indeed, adding increasingly higher percentages of permanently positively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane lipid (DOTAP) shifted tissue tropism from the liver to the lungs.",

Zangi\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary This article belongs to the Special Issue mRNA Therapeutics: A Themed Issue in Honor of Professor Katalin Karik\u00f3. Abstract Advances in the using in vitro transcribed (IVT) modRNA in the past two decades, especially the tremendous recent success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, have brought increased attention to IVT mRNA technology. Despite its well-known use in infectious disease vaccines, IVT modRNA technology is being investigated mainly in cancer immunotherapy and protein replacement therapy, with ongoing clinical trials in both areas. One of the main barriers to progressing mRNA therapeutics to the clinic is determining how to deliver mRNA to target cells and protect it from degradation. Over the years, many different vehicles have been developed to tackle this issue. Desirable vehicles must be safe, stable and preferably organ specific for successful mRNA delivery to clinically relevant cells and tissues. In this review we discuss various mRNA delivery platforms, with particular focus on attempts to create organ-specific vehicles for therapeutic mRNA delivery.\n## Organ-Specific LNPs\nThe abovementioned vaccine studies used intramuscular injections of LNP-RNA for systemic immune response, as well as systemic delivery to the liver in the case of Patisiran, but how could we direct LNP-RNA into other organs for protein replacement therapy? Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been shown to bind to intravenously injected LNPs. Crucial to transporting and metabolizing lipids, ApoE regulates lipoprotein and cholesterol levels in the plasma via high-affinity binding to the family of LDL receptors [70,71]. The liver is the main organ for clearing ApoE-binding lipoproteins; hence, systemically delivered LNPs would bind ApoE and preferentially home to the liver [36,72]. A study performed on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice using cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA demonstrated that the hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs is ApoE dependent, suggesting that LNP charge plays a role in LNP tissue tropism [73]. \n\nWhile excessive liver homing is a notable disadvantage of intravenously injected ionizable LNPs, a selective organ targeting (SORT) strategy could overcome this issue [74]. In this system, various lipid classes were designed for tissue-specific gene delivery and editing using CRISPR-Cas technology. Based on previous work, researchers speculated that the key to organ-specific delivery would be manipulating the internal and/or external charge of formulated LNPs [75][76][77]. Along with standard LNP components including an ionizable cationic lipid, phospholipids, cholesterol and PEG, the authors proposed adding SORT molecules which allow lung-, spleen-or liver-specific gene delivery. Indeed, adding increasingly higher percentages of permanently positively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane lipid (DOTAP) shifted tissue tropism from the liver to the lungs.",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

            "text": ". The presence of many 327 apolipoproteins in LNP coronas correlated with LNP efficacy (-0.1<Orthogonality<0.1). In 328 particular, Apo A-II, B, C-II, and C-IV, the structural proteins found in HDL, VLDL, and 329 chylomicron (CM) lipoproteins, were positively correlated with LNPs performance. Apo M, which 330 is found primarily on HDL 46 , also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In 331 contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV 47 , which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a 332 moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered 333 highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-334 derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig.  335 14). Remarkably, quantitative imaging revealed that LNPs stimulated higher cellular eGFP mRNA 336 expression when supplemented with obese plasmas that resulted in coronas with less ApoE (Fig.  337 1e). As will be shown later, this is also not simply because the obese serum stimulates protein 338 production, but rather that specific plasma components accumulate in LNP coronas and this leads 339 to enhanced LNP function. 340\n\nWhile not all protein components of LNP coronas are strongly correlated with LNP function, the 341 majority of lipids associated with LNPs did correlate with enhanced LNP performance. A lipid-342 rich corona, in general, is favorable for LNP mediated mRNA delivery. However, the 343 orthogonality of lipid hits was higher than most of the protein hits (Orthogonality>0.1 or <-0.1), 344\n\nsuggesting that the corona proteins are more relevant for explaining the differences between LNP 345 function in lean and obese contexts. The plasma lipids became more relevant (orthagonality 346 dropped below 0.1 in most cases) when considering particle uptake as opposed to function. While 347 particle uptake was not our primary readout, it is interesting that PC, for example, has previously",

            "text": "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake. [86,87] e PEG shield significantly impacts LNP uptake rates in cells and can cause substantial disparities between in vitro and in vivo results.",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

[70]Indeed, this approach has been successfully applied in the case of Onpattro, the first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP for treating hereditary disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.The liver affinity of Onpattro has been strongly linked to its ApoE-rich protein corona, particularly through the interaction with hepatocytes via ApoE-binding receptors like low-density lipoprotein receptors. [71]Very recently this hallmark has been updated, as ApoE-containing high density lipoprotein enriched in NP-corona complexes was shown to be a better predictor of in vivo liver efficacy compared to sole ApoE.

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking. After intravenous administration, serum ApoE usually binds onto LNPs, leading to liver accumulation of the nanoparticles. [40,42,43] Albumin is the most abundant proteins in the serum and was reported to affect the endocytosis pathways and intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles. [41] Previous studies have shown that albumin-coated nanoparticles preferentially bind to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18 on the cell surface and promote endocytosis via caveola-mediated or micropinocytosis-related pathways. [44,45] We found that the GFP delivery efficacy of LNPs increases with increasing albumin concentrations, but is scarcely influenced by ApoE, suggesting that albumin plays a crucial role in LNPs mediated protein delivery in serum-containing media (Figure 3c). The addition of fucoidan, a gp30 and gp18 inhibitor, dramatically inhibited the intracellular delivery of GFP by LNPs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that endocytosis of GFP-loaded LNPs depends on albumin receptors (Figure 3e). We further investigated the cell internalization pathways of GFP-loaded LNPs using different endocytosis inhibitors in the presence and absence of 10% FBS. The LNPs were internalized through multiple pathways, such as macropinocytosis-, lipid raft-, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis in serum-free medium (Figure S7, Supporting Information). However, the internalization of nanoparticles in the serumcontaining medium was only inhibited by genistein (Geni), a caveola-dependent endocytosis inhibitor (Figure 3d,f). Besides Geni, the uptake of GFP-loaded LNP is also inhibited by filipin III (a cholesterol depletion agent), digitonin (a cholesterol depletion agent), and brefeldin A (BFA, a caveola-disrupting agent and caveosome trafficking inhibitor).",

The incubation of mRNA-lipoplexes (made with Lipofectamine 2000 \u00ae ), with different concentrations of fetal bovine serum (FBS), results in a decrease in transfection efficiency (from 92% of transfected cells at 0% FBS to 31% at 10% FBS), with increase in onset time delivery (1.6 h at 0% FBS and 2.9 h at 10% FBS), and a decrease in expression rate. Interestingly, when LNPs are used (made using ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA), the opposite behavior is observed. Regarding these results, an essential parameter to take into consideration for the intracellular fate of the mRNA particles is the protein corona formed after interaction with biological fluids (e.g., FBS) [114,115].

The influence of the protein corona has been well described for LNPs-mediated liver delivery. Notably, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is well described for the protein corona of LNPs [116]. This interest in ApoE is high, since in addition to LNPs specifically targeting the liver, a lot of LNP formulations exhibit a relatively high amount of liver accumulation in vivo. In the blood circulation and among different functions, ApoE is involved in the transportation of lipids to the liver for recycling. Recently, Sebastiani et al. [117] showed that",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

During in-depth exploration of the relationship fate between protein corona and NPs in vivo, the influence of protein corona on mRNA NP targeting was found to have two sides. The adsorption process of protein coronas is known to be difficult to control, and protein coronas can even mask the targeting ligands, leading to loss of targeting efficacy. Based on these results, the protein corona is considered an \"enemy\" in NPs targeting strategies, necessitating resistance to protein corona adsorption in vivo. However, emerging evidence shows that some specific protein coronas in the blood can improve mRNA NP delivery to specific tissues [91]. For example, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with liver-specific delivery of NPs. If these protein coronas with specific targeting properties can be reasonably utilized, the targeting strategies of mRNA NPs can be greatly optimized.",

The properties of such a particle-protein complex differ significantly from those of the formulated particle. Hence, the further biological responses of the body as well as the biodistribution of the nanoparticles are expected to be influenced by the nanoparticle-protein complex [34]. Therefore, the PLA nanoparticles were incubated with human blood plasma for several time points and we examined the binding of plasma proteins to the nanoparticles. The protein binding profiles were visualized by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that an exposure for five minutes was already sufficient for an efficient corona formation ( Figure 7A). Also, the amount of corona proteins increased over time, albeit the corona seems to change only quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Furthermore, we examined the presence of apolipoproteins in the protein corona ( Figure 7B). Apolipoproteins are part of the circulating lipoproteins and serve as receptor ligands for lipid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and it was suggested that apolipoprotein-modified nanoparticles are able to transport drugs across the BBB [35][36][37][38]. We observed that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) are already present in the nanoparticle-protein complex after five minutes of exposure, and that the amount of ApoA4 slightly decreased and the ApoE concentrations significantly increased over time. The formation of the apolipoprotein corona on the PLA nanoparticles indicates a potential transport route of the nanoparticles through a lipoprotein receptor transcytosis pathway [37,39].",

            "text": "It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (64), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (65) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (65). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (33) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density. Thus, it appears that ApoE exerted distinct functions on NPs with low and high PEG densities. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that apolipoproteins involved in the trafficking of lipids in the bloodstream also impact on the in vivo clearance of NPs. \n\nOnce inside the cell, it is presumed that the protein corona is removed in phagolysosomes, causing the true \"identity\" of the NPs to be revealed (66).",

Although protein corona formation has been associated with undesirable effects, recent studies suggest that corona-mediated targeting by controlling the function of target plasma proteins on nanosurface may provide a more specific drug delivery. 32,144\u2212146 With regard to the brain targeting, apolipoproteins play a key role. They are involved in the intercellular transport of insoluble lipids to various cell types, which are taken up via specific apolipoprotein-recognizing receptors (e.g., LDL receptor and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1)) expressed in several tissues and in the brain. 147 For instance, Zhang et al. obtained a successful corona-mediated braintargeting using a liposomal system loaded with doxorubicin and functionalized with a peptide derived from the amyloid \u03b2protein (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ). When exposed to biological milieu, this peptide specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of the brain targeting apolipoproteins (i.e, ApoA1, ApoE, and ApoJ), resulting in the exposure of their receptor-binding domain. The reengineered liposomes demonstrated high braintargeting capacity and improved anticancer effects compared to nontarget plain liposomes. 145 By use of a different approach, lipid NPs have been prefunctionalized with ApoE4 before systemic administration. This strategy increased NPs translocation into brain parenchyma and exhibited a 3-fold improvement in brain accumulation compared to undecorated NPs. 146 Despite these promising results, there is no available data concerning the exploitation of corona proteins for systemic delivery of nucleic acid. However, lessons learned from these studies could offer further insights into formulations designed for targeted delivery of nucleic acids to the brain.",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

There are multiple ways to target liver hepatocytes. A major mechanism proposed for targeting liver hepatocytes involves the formation of a protein corona enriched in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein involved in endogenous cholesterol transport (Fig. 3b). First, solvent-exposed PEG lipid desorbs from the LNP surface, unshielding the LNP for interactions with plasma proteins 98 . ApoE is among the subset of proteins that most abundantly adsorb to the LNP surface, and it can bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) 96 that is highly expressed by hepatocytes. LNPs enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, localizing to the endosome. As the endosome acidifies, ionizable lipids in the LNP are protonated, resulting in electrostatic interactions with negatively charged endosome lipids 27 and, eventually, disrupting the endosomal bilayer 143 . An LNP pK a of around 6.4 has been determined as optimal for endosomal escape, leading to cargo release into the hepatocyte cytosol to exert its therapeutic effect 159 . Knowing this mechanism has allowed researchers to improve the efficacy of LNP delivery to the liver 159 , highlighting the importance of mechanistically studying nanoparticle targeting.\n\nOther mechanisms for targeting hepatocytes that are ApoEindependent have also been developed. For example, incorporating 'synergistic' alkyne lipids into a cKK-E12 lipopeptide-based LNP promotes the binding of serum albumin to enhance mRNA delivery to the liver 160 , demonstrating that endogenous targeting of hepatocytes is possible using multiple proteins.\n\nInstead of altering the molecular composition of an LNP to yield a specific protein corona for hepatocyte delivery (endogenous targeting), conjugating ligands",

            "text": "Although NPs have been studied in a large number of preclinical and clinical trials, few NPs have been successfully translated for clinical use [11,12]. When NPs enter biological fluids after systemic administration, they interact with biomolecules such as proteins to form protein corona (PC) [13,14]. The formation of a PC changes the size, surface charge, aggregation state, and targeting properties of NPs, which ultimately determines the biological identity of NPs [15]. The biological identity of NPs plays an important role in the drug delivery, circulation time, cellular uptake, and cell recognition of NPs [16]. Nanoparticle-protein interactions and the formation of the PC are major challenges for drug delivery. Meanwhile, the interactions and PC may be used to decorate NPs and adjust the type of PC to enhance the targeting efficiency [17,18]. Therefore, by regulating the interactions between NPs and biological systems in situ, the surface-adsorbed PC provides insights into the use of the PC as a targeting agent for drug delivery and effective biomedical applications of NPs. \n\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE), an endogenous protein (40-70 \u03bcg/mL), is composed of 299 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa. The structure of ApoE segregates into two ordered segments connected by residues 165-200, which are random segments [19,20]. ApoE has many important functions. First, the amino-terminal domain of ApoE consists of a four-helix bundle. Its low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-binding region containing residues 136-150 is within this four-helix bundle and includes rich lysyl and arginyl residues; therefore, drug delivery may be mediated through the interactions of ApoE with the LDL receptor (LDLr) and LDLr-related protein 1 receptor (LRP1r) on cancer cells. Second, the lipid-binding site involves residues 244-272 of the C-terminal domain of ApoE and has a high percentage of \u03b1-helices [21,22]. ApoE, regarded as an exchangeable apolipoprotein, participates in the transport of lipids between the brain and plasma.",

            "text": "Besides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs. LNPs with DOPE preferentially accumulate in the liver, and the interaction between LNPs with DOPE and ApoE was stronger than that with DSPC [118]. Protein coronas other than ApoE can be formed by modifying the lipid chemistry of LNPs. As a result, LNPs can enter hepatocytes through other endocytosis routes besides CME. Miao et al. [107] demonstrated that by incorporating alkyne and ester groups into cKK-E12-LNPs, serum albumin gets attached LNP surface instead of ApoE surface, and LNPs entered hepatocytes through CvME and micropinocytosis. \n\nFor liver diseases, mRNA-LNPs can be delivered to hepatocytes by endogenous targeting. In a mouse model of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, Yang et al. [14] found that the ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting was not significantly affected. They synthesized LNPs containing ALC-0315, DSCP, cholesterol, and ALC-0159, and the LNPs successfully delivered HNF4A mRNA to hepatocytes through ApoE action. However, under specific pathological conditions, such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), the LDLRs almost disappeared, seriously affecting the ApoE-based endogenous targeting [119]. Therefore, active targeting strategies based on  receptor-ligand binding are equally important in hepatocyte targeting, besides passive and endogenous targeting. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is present in many hepatocyte membranes. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) can be conjugated with mRNA-LNPs to actively target hepatocytes by ASGPR binding [120]. Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92].",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "However, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells. For example, coronas with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have increased access to the brain [24]. Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE [29]. In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain [14]. Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs [14]. \n\nIn recent in vitro studies, the critical role of serum concentration as a primary modulator of toxicity to NPs has been documented. High serum protein concentrations allow for protein attachment to hard coronas, which shields cells from immediate damage after engulfment of NPs [30,31]. In vivo serum concentrations are 10 to 50-fold higher than those used in cell culture (2%-10%, approximately 4 mg/mL) [30]. Thus, NP targeting of cells in culture is not necessarily reproducible in vivo [32]. In one example, the cytotoxic effects of NPs on A549 (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial) cells decreased with increasing concentrations of serum, from 4 to 40 mg/mL. Cytoxicity was evaluated based on cell death and decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels. The highest concentrations of serum fully protected A549 cells from NP toxicity [32]. The same investigators in related studies with lower concentrations of serum determined that NPs induce damage in a variety of different cell types via apparently similar mechanisms [30][31][32][33]. Endocytosis of NPs leads to degradation of the hard corona and exposure of NP-ligand surfaces in the lysosome.",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

For example, the higher ApoE content (i.e., obese v.s. lean, or 10% v.s 155 5% plasma) did not introduce significantly higher eGFP expression levels in recipient hepatocytes 156 at the tested dose range. In contrast, the 1% obese supplementation resulted in the highest eGFP 157 expression. This suggests that ApoE is not the sole determinant of LNP hepatic potency. The 158\n\nimaging results (Fig. 1b) also implied that the difference in eGFP expression did not directly 159 correlate to the overall amount of ApoE or other nutrients provided by plasma. 160\n\nBased on these findings, we hypothesized that the altered mRNA cargo expression is, at least 161 partially, a result of different biomolecular corona formations. The binding of the corona 162 components to LNPs can cause structural and compositional rearrangement 24 , and this can affect 163 potency. Thus, in the 1% lean condition, the attenuation in the eGFP expression was likely due to 164 the limited availability of biomolecules necessary to form the biomolecular corona, especially at 165 doses higher than 50 ng mRNA/well. The obese plasma condition preserved the eGFP expression 166 and enhanced the expression compared to high plasma ratios because, in this case, a corona formed 167 that was more compatible with hepatocytes. Alternatively, lowering the plasma ratio may also 168 unmask corona interactions with recipient cells, as previously reported 36 . Therefore, isolating LNP 169 coronas and identifying the corona determinant driving altered eGFP mRNA expression is 170 necessary to understand how to modulate corona composition and adapt to individual physiology 171 and pathology variations. 173 Given the great variation in abundance and complexity of plasma biomolecules, the LNP-corona 174 complex (LNPcor) must be separated",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "Serum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake. To evaluate whether the ratio of albumin and ApoE would affect cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of these LNPs, LNPs were prelabeled with fluorescent dye (either with rhod-PE on the lipid particles or with Cy5-mRNA) and cultured in a proteinsupplemented media. In serum-free media, cellular uptake remained the same for all three LNPs (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8); whereas in serum-containing media, the hepatocytes uptake of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs was significantly increased as compared with A6 LNPs (Fig. 2d). By treating hepatocytes with LNPs incubated in an albumin-rich or ApoE solution (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8), we demonstrated that albumin plays a key role in the cellular uptake of cKK-E12 containing LNPs. Previous work has described ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of siRNA LNPs, however, in our case the role of ApoE is less significant. This could be due to either saturation of ApoE secretion from hepatocytes masking LNP-mediated ApoE uptake effects, or the intrinsic difference between mRNA and siRNA LNP formulations 24,25 . Therefore, we hypothesize that LNPs coated with serum albumin may facilitate the delivery of mRNA to the liver via an ApoE \"independent\" pathway. \n\nTo further evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the protein expression of cKK-E12, A6, and Syn-3 LNPs containing Fluc mRNA in primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of albumin, ApoE, or serum. Consistent with the uptake study and studies using ionizable LNPs 11,25 , protein expression with the A6 mRNA LNP was found to be independent of albumin or serum, but significantly enhanced by ApoE (Fig. 2e-g).",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

            "text": "As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115]. \n\nThe presence of a protein corona on LNPs' surfaces enhances effective cellular uptake, specifically lipoproteins; notably, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a significant role in mediating the binding to LDL receptors situated in plasma membranes, contributing significantly to the process of cellular uptake. The development of a protein corona affects the chemical and physical characteristics of LNPs, increasing the hydrodynamic diameter and modifying the charge on the surface. Nevertheless, all protein coronas contained different patterns of proteins related with the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and the transport capacity, to modulate, in diverse ways, LNP-cell interactions [116]. The initial physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface properties, composition, and structure, predominantly determine the biological fate of LNPs within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine. Notably, LNPs can be categorized as either digestible or indigestible based on their composition, resulting in two distinct biological paths for LNPs. Digestible LNPs undergo digestion initiated by lipases and subsequent hydrolysis across the GI tract upon ingestion. This process leads to the breakdown of lipids, resulting in lipid digestion products rich in fatty acids and monoglycerides. These products, along with encapsulated drugs, bile salts, and phospholipids, form mixed micelles. After absorption by enterocytes, these lipid digestion products and encapsulated drugs enter the systemic circulation through either the portal vein or the lymphatic system. The specific route taken depends on the lipid structure within the LNP formulation and the hydrophobic nature of the encapsulated drugs. Alternatively, indigestible LNPs can remain intact and potentially penetrate the mucus layer to reach epithelial surfaces. After penetration, these LNPs can be transported through the tight junction, or absorbed up by enterocytes or transported by M cells, to enter the circulation [117].",

When iLNPs are systemically administered, they may bind with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in circulation, then interact with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a highly-expressed protein on hepatocytes, and finally being internalized by hepatocytes via LDLR-mediated endocytosis [43,44]. In this study, the LDLR over-expressed HepG2-Luc cells were used to evaluate whether ApoE was an important factor for cellular uptake of iLNPs. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, it can be clearly found that when ApoE was added into the culture medium, the amounts of cellular uptake iLP181 LNPs were significant more than that without ApoE, demonstrating that the ApoE significantly boosted the cellular uptake of iLNPs. In addition, subcellular localization of the payload nucleic acids also verified that ApoE promoted the internalization of iLP181 LNPs (Fig. 2E  and F).",

            "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "Incorporation of 20% ionizable cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) into LNPs improved the uptake efficiency of hepatocytes to as high as 93% [106]. In subsequent studies, Siegwart et al. [116] elucidated the hepatocyte-targeting mechanism of 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs and identified that hepatocytetargeting was related to ApoE adsorption on mRNA-LNP surface. \n\nApoE is a small, secreted protein that plays a crucial role in cellular lipid metabolism and endogenous cholesterol transport. It can bind to LDLR, which is abundant on hepatocyte surface, making it an essential component of endogenous targeting to hepatocytes. The ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting occurs through CME. Besides MC3-LNPs, 5A2-SC8-LNPs mentioned above, cKK-E12-LNPs also utilize ApoE-based hepatocyte-endogenous targeting. Paunovska et al. [91] observed that the ability of cKK-E12-LNPs to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in ApoE-/-and LDLR-/-mice was significantly lower than in wild-type mice, confirming the ApoE-dependent targeting of cKK-E12-LNPs to hepatocytes. Comparing cKK-E12-LNPs and cKK-E15-LNPs having the same ionizable lipid core but different hydrophobic tail lengths revealed that cKK-E12-LNPs exhibited efficient mRNA delivery to hepatocytes in wild-type mice. These results indicate that changes in the structure of ionizable lipids in LNPs can affect ApoE-based endogenous targeting. Besides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs.",

            "text": "Despite their clinical successes, our understanding of how and which biological components in complex biofluids, including blood, LNPs interact with, and the impact of such interactions on the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of LNP-based therapeutic products are still sparse and almost entirely limited to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE). To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a ligand of BBB receptors, was used to target RhB-labeled solid lipid nanoparticles carrying Aricept ODT \u00ae (Donepezil).Their cellular uptake studies of the SLN cargo in rat and human BBB models and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells revealed an increase in RhB cargo in all tested cell types in the presence of ApoE targeting ligand on the surface of their formulation.For instance, in primary rat brain endothelial cells, the uptake of RhB-labeled donepezil cargo packaged in ApoE-targeted NPs was greater than fourfold (463%) higher than the uptake of cargo enclosed in non-targeted particles after 2 h of incubation [266].\n\nMoreover, when targeting the brain with LNPs, two significant problems need to be addressed.Primarily, when these particles are injected i.v., they tend to be trapped by the liver and lead to what is known as hepato-cytotoxicity.The discontinuous endothelium explains this phenomenon in one part in the liver and in another part in the biological effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [267,268].When LNPs are in blood circulation, ApoE can form a corona around them.LNPs are then directed toward the liver because ApoE binds specifically to hepatocyte receptors.The second complication is that the LNPs need to pass through the BBB.\n\nTo face the latter problem, Ma et al. [198] developed a class of neurotransmitter-derived lipidoids (NT-lipidoids).When conjugated to LNPs, initially unable to permeate the BBB, these NT-lipidoids enable passage through the BBB.For instance, with the NT-lipidoid NT1-O14B, Ma et al. [198] have successfully delivered antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against tau and the genome editing fusion protein (\u221227)GFP-Cre recombinase to the mouse brain via i.v.injection.",

There was a moderate correlation between individual corona ApoE 366 and cellular eGFP expression and, according to our data, both corona and plasma AopE were not the optimal indicators for hepatic mRNA expression following LNP delivery (Fig 5b and 5c). In 368 contrast, the correlation between individual ApoM and cellular eGFP expression was much 369 stronger. The corona ApoM also correlated more with LNP function than plasma ApoM (Fig 5b  370 and 5c). In addition, other major HDL-associated apolipoproteins, such as ApoA-II, were also 371 highly correlated with cellular eGFP expression (Supplementary Fig. 16). Lipoprotein fragments, 372 even intact lipoproteins, have previously been identified in nanoparticle coronas 49,50 , so we 373 hypothesized that LNP corona formation involved interactions with various lipoprotein particles. 374\n\nIn terms of composition, lipoproteins particles are, however, complex and dynamic. While our 375 analysis revealed that certain lipoproteins correlated more with increased LNP efficacy, it is 376 challenging to map this proteomic fingerprint onto a naturally occurring lipoprotein particle 377 population, although our data suggested that HDL particles were a likely source of the efficacious 378 corona components. 379\n\nTo explore LNP interactions with lipoprotein particles experimentally, Huh7 hepatocytes were 380 exposed to LNPs together with 1% lean plasma spiked with purified HDL, VLDL, and CM to 381 determine how these components affected cellular mRNA expression (recall that LNPs 382 supplemented with 1% lean plasma are not very functional in Fig. 1).

            "text": "In agreement with the previous investigation in mice, the in vivo corona was found to show a greater molecular complexity in comparison to its ex vivo counterpart (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2019). Bertrand et al. (2017) performed comprehensive studies using a library of polymeric nanoparticles and different knockout mouse models to examine the role of the in vivo protein adsorption for the clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream. They could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the nanoparticles was dependent on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) density. Hence, while ApoE appeared to rescue nanoparticles with low PEG coverage from rapid clearance, it also seemed to act as a potential ligand for low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) receptor on all nanoparticles irrespective of PEG density (Bertrand et al., 2017). The LDL receptor is normally responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles decorated with apolipoproteins. Moreover, studies using complement-deficient mice suggested that complement activation cannot be the sole predictor of nanoparticle residency in the bloodstream in mice since the biological fate of both short-circulating and long-circulating nanoparticles was unaffected by the absence of complement protein 3 (C3) (Bertrand et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that patisiran (Onpattro\u2122), a lipid nanoparticle formulation of small interfering RNA for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin (TTR)-mediated amyloidosis, appears to be targeted to hepatocytes through the adsorption of ApoE on the surface of the nanoparticles following i.v. administration (Akinc et al., 2019). Thus, while targeting of nanomedicines may be achieved by the incorporation of specific ligands, it seems that the adsorption of ApoE enables patisiran to exploit the body's own targeting system for lipid-laden particles.",

(2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "Moreover, bio-coronas can enhance the effectiveness of NPs used as drug delivery vehicles by increasing their payload capacity (Hamad-Schifferli 2015). Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "LNPs can bind with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in plasma to form ApoE-bound lipoproteins, which are mainly cleared by the liver, allowing LNPs to reach the liver preferentially for liver targeting. This method is commonly used to deliver RNA to the liver using cationic or ionizable LNPs. The presence of ionizable lipids and intentional short acyl chain PEG lipids enhance the ability of LNPs to deliver RNA compared to liposomes. Liver targeting is insufficient for treatment, as specific cell targeting is often necessary. Therefore, Kim et al modified the overall size of LNPs by adjusting the polyethylene glycol (PEG) content, specifically targeting hepatocytes. 76 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be modified to selectively target specific cell types. They offer the benefits of delivering mRNA with high transfection efficiency, high expression levels, and good stability, making them crucial carriers for mRNA vaccine development. 77 bumin Carriers and FDC Albumin carriers can specifically bind to cell surface albumin receptor (gp60), which binds to intracellular caveolin-1, leading to membrane invagination and the formation of caveolae. Caveolae can transport albumin carriers to tumors, making carriers bind to secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine protein overexpressed in tumors, thereby targeting the albumin carriers to the tumor. 78 The tumor-targeting effect of ferritin is ten times greater than that of the EPR effect. Ferritin does not require surface modification as it naturally targets tumors through its specific affinity for transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is overexpressed in malignant tumors. Ferritin is the optimal size of 12 nm for inducing the EPR effect caused by disrupting the blood and lymphatic systems in tumors. 79 AuNPs, Nanogels, and ASP AuNPs, after being injected into the body, can accumulate in inflammatory and tumor sites through the enhanced permeability and EPR effect to achieve passive targeting. 37 Nanogels also accumulate at the site of lesions through the enhanced permeability and EPR effect to achieve passive targeting.",

Additionally, it was observed that a quantitative estimation of the PEG in the PEG-conjugated lipid chains in LNPs was the determinant factor for the successful transfection of siRNA for solid tumor therapy [85]. Deng and colleagues showed that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-coupled gold NPs adsorb and extend the fibrinogen from human serum, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines mediated via the positive interaction with the Mac-1 receptor [42]. For instance, an early report by Kreuter et al. addressed the fact that apolipoprotein E from serum adsorbed to polysorbate 80 NPs, which facilitated transport across the blood brain barrier [86]. Other studies have demonstrated that ionizable lipid nanoparticles bearing apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) ligand normally adsorb ApoE, resulting in a pronounced cell uptake into the liver cells mediated through several receptors withaffinity for the same [87]. Furthermore, DNA and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane-bearing lipidic nanoparticles had a high level of vitronectin in human plasma that was readily taken up into tumor tissues bearing the overexpressed receptor vitronectin (integrin \u03b1v\u03b23) [88]. It has been shown that silica NPs interact with a specific receptor after the formation of PC in human serum with LDL, and it has also been shown that IgG prompted uptake interceded via an interaction with the LDL receptor and the Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) [89,90].",

Using knockout models, Akinc and colleagues demonstrated that uptake of LNP by hepatocytes was largely dependent on both ApoE and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) [60,61]. However, not all delivery systems depend on ApoE targeting. In the case of the potent in vivo activity lipid-like molecule, C12-200, uptake was reported to be through an ApoE independent, micropinocytosis pathway [62][63][64].",

Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes.

Proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (e.g. histidinerich glycoprotein, kininogen, plasminogen, and vitronectin) were the dominant protein group for all SiNCs ( Figure 5C and D). Similar to literature reports, 22,41,43,44 histidine-rich glycoprotein was strongly enriched for all SiNCs, especially in LUT-stabilized SiNCs (>35%) while in CTAC-stabilized ones the amount was slightly lower 15-20% ( Figure 5D). In addition, serum albumin, which is the most abundant protein in the blood serum, was also identified in the protein corona for all SiNCs. As discovered by other researchers, 22,[41][42][43][44] apolipoproteins were identified in the protein corona of all SiNCs, especially apolipoprotein B-100. Apolipoproteins play a major role in lipid and cholesterol transportation and could facilitate intracellular trafficking. 45, 46 Disparate corona compositions were observed between hydrophobic and hydrophilic cores SiNCs. Apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E were enriched in hydrophobic core SiNCs, whereas insulinlike growth factor was enriched in hydrophilic core SiNCs. Significant enrichment of kininogen was detected for CTACstabilized SiNCs, while a notable amount of plasminogen was detected for LUT-stabilized NCs. Some of these dominant proteins detected in the protein corona might be responsible to either facilitate or inhibit the uptake, which needs to be further investigated. This is clearly a work that needs to be done not only for SiNCs and is the focus of further work.",

            "text": "A similar observation emerged when introducing cholesterol into DNA tetrahedrons, leading to hepatocyte accumulation. [74]Interestingly, other studies demonstrated that substituting neutral cholesterol with positively charged DC-cholesterol on the surface of LNPs leads to a transition from ApoE-to vitronectin-based corona profile, diminishing the NPs' ability to target and transfect hepatocellular carcinoma. [75]Furthermore, a shift in the tropism toward the lungs was achieved by introducing quaternary ammonium containing lipids like 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), dimethyl-dioctadecylammonium (DDAB) or 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (EPC).The concept of incorporating a tropism-shifting lipid component altering biodistribution was termed selective organ targeting (SORT) by Siegwart and colleagues (Figure 3). [76]Vitronectin was identified as the predominant protein corona constituent of these LNPs containing the aforementioned cationic lipids. [77]This protein bears the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence by which it recognizes integrin  v  3 , commonly overexpressed in pulmonary endothelium, solid tumors, and tumor neo vasculature. [78,79]This specific targeting of cancer cells overexpressing the  v  3 recep-tor has been demonstrated for DOTAP/DNA NPs [79] and association of vitronectin with DOTAP liposomes has also been established. [80]Overall, these works reveal that ascribing a functional role to specific corona constituents proves to be a more intricate endeavor than previously assumed.\n\nThe role of LNPs' protein corona profile in influencing in vivo targetability has been subjected to deeper investigation in a library screen approach.Findings from screening indicated that LNPs containing ionizable lipids with distinct bonds in their tails, O-series (ester bonds) versus N-series (amide bonds) lipids shifted the delivery from liver to lung.",

            "text": "Recent attempts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of chemical targeting have generated accumulating evidence suggesting that the targeting outcomes of chemical modifications of NPs were in fact mediated by the protein corona. [26] uch observations have motivated the adoption of a new paradigm, \"endogenous targeting,\" which seeks to modulate the protein corona to achieve improved targeting, often via chemical modifications to the particle. \n\nThe consideration of the protein corona has long been included in nanocarrier design. It was traditionally considered that the impact of the protein corona was undesirable, and the paradigm was to eliminate the corona completely by incorporating PEG into the NP formulation. In addition to regulating the surface charge, PEGylation also creates an antifouling hydration layer that inhibits protein adsorption on the particle surface. The improvement of delivery performance due to PEGylation was largely attributed to the reduction in the amount of adsorbed serum opsonin and the consequent downregulation of immune clearance. Nonetheless, it has been increasingly apparent that PEGylation cannot completely prevent protein corona formation, and that the effect of the corona is not entirely detrimental. \n\nIt has been shown that the ability of SORT to direct spleen tropism originated from the elevated level of \u03b22-GPI in the corona of the particle. [34] Such an observation was supported by earlier studies showing increased uptake by macrophages. [114] It was hypothesized that the recruitment of \u03b22-GPI can be mediated by the inclusion of anionic lipid in the formulation. Successful delivery to the immune cell population was also shown to be associated with a low content of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the protein corona. It was rationalized that ApoE leads to the capture of the particle by the liver through the receptor-dependent pathway, conferring a predominant hepatic tropism. Thus, surface chemistry that resists the adsorption of ApoE might prove a viable strategy for improving immune cell transfection in in vivo. \n\nOther indirect evidence supports the importance of protein corona as a major contributor to NP tropism. For example, the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies can partly be explained by differences in or absence of the protein corona.",

            "text": "Many diseases can affect the liver. Among them, tyrosinemia [104,105] and autoimmune hepatitis [106] are very severe diseases. Fortunately, LNP delivery to the liver is very effective. It is enhanced by the biological effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [107,108]. After LNPs are injected intravenously, ApoE forms a corona around the particles. Since ApoE binds specifically to receptors on hepatocytes, it directs LNPs towards the liver. This explains why LNPs are more easily trapped by the liver [108]. In addition, the liver can be used as a protein factory [109] to treat various rare diseases through gene therapy. As the liver is an excellent therapeutic target, it is important to optimize delivery to this organ. \n\nPatisiran (ONPATTRO\u2122) is the first RNA drug delivered by LNPs that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [107]. This LNP is composed of DLin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/cholesterol/DMG-PEG at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 [110]. As it was the first to be approved, this formulation inspired the composition of other LNPs. Table 4 presents some formulations that target the liver. \n\nLiu et al. [22] obtained impressive results. When delivering LNPs with Cas9 mRNA, along with a sgRNA targeting PCSK9, they succeeded in reducing the serum PCSK9 by 80%. They used the following formulation: BAMEA-16B/DOPE/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG (16/4/8/1 w:w). They used a lipid:mRNA ratio of 15:1 (w:w). Their LNP had a size of 230 nm. Fortunately, they observed no signs of inflammation and no obvious hepatocellular injury. Rothgangl et al. [113] have obtained important results.",

Apart from the ability to harness protein corona and tumor targeting, the bio-inspired pre-coating could also increase the stability of this NP system under the lysosomal acid environment and reduce its cytotoxicity. The anti-cancer cell proliferation and anti-tumor proliferation effects were studied in vitro and in vivo, proving that precoating the functional biomimetic albumin is an excellent and promising strategy for better drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic effects. Han Yang et al. showed another bio-inspired NP system pre-coated with cyclic RGDyK peptide (cRGD) modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) for impeding the formation of the protein corona, enhancing targeting ability to tumor cells, increasing delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs and improving therapeutic effects [79]. By preventing the protein corona formation, the pre-coating in this system played a dual role: enhancing the targeting ability of cancer cells and reducing serum protein adsorption for a prolonged circulation time (Figure 8B). Apart from the ability to harness protein corona Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona [80].",

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition.",

            "text": "They tested the delivery of LNP libraries in vivo based on the translation of Cre mRNA to Cre protein and isolation of fluorescent cells where targeted DNA was edited by Cre protein. This approach resulted in the identification of two novel LNPs that efficiently deliver mRNA to endothelial cells [147]. This study showed the importance of optimization of LNP composition not only for improvements in efficacy but also as a path for identifying LNPs with new tropisms. \n\nStealth lipids such as PEG-lipid are necessary for increased half-life and stability of the LNP particle and influence its physicochemical properties. After LNP-mRNA administration to the blood, LNP adsorbs on its surface numerous proteins forming \"protein corona\" (reviewed in [63,148]). Among others, these proteins include albumin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, and complement proteins [149]. PEG-lipids-shielding lowers the interaction of LNP with complement and other proteins lowering the internalization of LNP-mRNAs by macrophages increasing circulation time of LNP-mRNA in the blood. In addition, PEG-lipids-shielding has impact against undesired aggregation and accumulation in filtering organs that might be caused by protein corona [148]. However, PEG-shielding may also lower the recognition of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and it can cause the formation of anti-PEG ADAs that lead to lowering the efficiency of the LNP [60,150]. Thus, the level of PEG-shielding must be optimized to obtain a compromise between efficacy and safety. With regard to anti-PEG ADAs formation, a recent study by Suzuki et al. examined PEG-containing LNP-siRNA in mice and found that LNPs with a fast-shedding PEG-lipid (short acyl chain) induced less anti-PEG IgM compared with those with long acyl chain LNPs [60]. The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60].",

            "text": "Under acidic conditions, positively charged amino groups facilitate ionic interactions with siRNA during particle assembly, and the release of the siRNA from acidic endosomes after LNP uptake, while remaining neutral at physiological pH. PEGylated lipid in LNP formulations provides a \"steric stabilization\" effect through the formation of a hydrophilic layer on the particle surface, preventing particle aggregation, and reducing uptake by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) [7,8]. \n\nThe cellular uptake and delivery of siRNA or mRNA LNPs is a complex, multi-step process, beginning with the attachment of the LNP to the cell surface, cell entry by endocytosis, release of the RNA from the endosome to cytosol, and binding of the RNA to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing, or to a ribosome for protein expression. The cell recognition and uptake process begins when LNPs come in contact with biological fluids, which rapidly results in the covering of the LNP surface with a corona of biomolecules, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins and coagulation factors [8,9]. Constituents of this corona act as ligands for specific cell surface receptors, initiating receptor-mediated endocytosis, and subsequent LNP internalization [10]. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) acts as the key endogenous ligand in this role, able to bind to ionizable LNPs enabling receptor-mediated endocytosis by low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R) [11,12], which are involved in cholesterol utilization and lipid homeostasis [13], and therefore widely distributed on all nucleated cells. The exchange of ApoE from chylomicrons and high-density lipoproteins results in the coating of the LNP surface with a relatively high concentration of ApoE ligands, resulting in high avidity for LDL-R.",

In the near future, scalable constant pH simulations (60) will likely enable us to study as well reverse smooth pH transitions for systems as large as LNPs from neutral to low pH corresponding to the situation in endosomes.\n\nRegarding processes following administration of LNPs loaded with mRNA, the surface of the LNP usually becomes coated with a biomolecular corona composed of different proteins influencing the distribution, the circulation time, and the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticle (61)(62)(63). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays, for example, a major role in the uptake of LNPs and liposomes into hepatocytes (64)(65)(66). Sebastiani et al. (18) measured fast binding kinetics of ApoE to LNPs and proposed that the presence of ApoE induces even an increased cholesterol level within the LNP surface. The observed formation of large solventaccessible DSPC/cholesterol domains at the surface of the Comirnaty LNP could represent a preferential binding site for ApoE. Hence, we think that the headgroup of the titratable aminolipid seems to play a minor role in the initial binding of ApoE at the LNP surface. mRNA release following cellular internalization of loaded LNPs, trapping in endosomes, and endosomal maturation with a concomitant decrease in pH is probably initiated by protonation of ALC-0315 aminolipids readily accessible within the LNP shell (Fig. S1).

This feature is advantageous in terms of the intracellular trafficking of therapeutic genes. There are two main strategies for targeting LDLR; (1) protein corona-mediated targeting; (2) ligand-based targeting. Once nanoparticles are injected into the systemic circulation, nanoparticles encounter serum components, such as proteins, resulting in the formation of a protein corona on the surface. The formation of a protein corona is critical for the design of efficient and safe nanoparticles for tissue-targeting, nanomedicines, and other applications, so research related to the protein corona is a subject of great interest [136][137][138][139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146]. Although protein corona formation on a nanoparticle surface may adversely affect targeting [147], controlling them can also be applied to achieve more effective targeting [51,54,55,[148][149][150][151][152][153][154]. With regard to the brain targeting through LDLR-mediated transcytosis, it was proposed that the use of certain apolipoproteins, such as ApoE and ApoA1, would be useful as endogenous ligands for crossing the BBB. One such example is polysorbate-80 coated nanoparticles which bind to ApoE and interact with the LDLR, resulting in an increased brain accumulation compared to nanoparticles without ApoE binding or with low levels of ApoE binding [51,[155][156][157]. Below, we also describe the brain targeting strategies that involve a protein corona. Angiopeps, which were derived from the Kunitz domains of aprotinin and other human proteins [158], is known as the most extensively explored ligand for targeting LDLRs for BBB crossing.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary target of RNA-loaded LNPs because it is estimated that genetic disorders in hepatocytes, parenchymal cells in liver tissue are the cause of thousands of human diseases [31]. The unique structural and functional features in liver tissues enable LNPs to efficiently enter parenchymal cells from the blood stream. The structural features include the presence of small pores, referred to as fenestrae, in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the absence of basement membranes between hepatocytes and the LSECs. Because it is known that the diameter of the fenestrae are approximately 107 nm and 141 nm in human and mouse, respectively [32], controlling size of LNPs to 100 nm or less in diameter is important in terms of delivering RNAs to hepatocytes [7,[33][34][35]. The functional feature is the presence of the apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) mediated the endogenous cellular uptake pathway in hepatocytes. Upon the intravenous administration of LNPs, ApoE proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the LNPs and are recognized by LDLRs, which are expressed at high levels on hepatocytes, resulting in the endocytosis of ApoE-bound LNPs. ApoE proteins are typically found in endogenous lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), high density lipoproteins, (HDLs), and chylomicrons (CMs), and are involved in promoting the cellular uptake of CMs and VLDLs by hepatocytes to manage lipid metabolism in the body [36,37]. Yan et al. first demonstrated the involvement of ApoE proteins in the elimination of liposomes from the blood stream by hepatocytes in mice [38]. They showed a 3.6-fold faster blood clearance and over a 20-fold higher accumulation in hepatocytes of neutral liposomes in wild-type mice compared to ApoE-deficient mice, which was not observed for negatively-charged liposomes.

            "text": "The abovementioned vaccine studies used intramuscular injections of LNP-RNA for systemic immune response, as well as systemic delivery to the liver in the case of Patisiran, but how could we direct LNP-RNA into other organs for protein replacement therapy? Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been shown to bind to intravenously injected LNPs. Crucial to transporting and metabolizing lipids, ApoE regulates lipoprotein and cholesterol levels in the plasma via high-affinity binding to the family of LDL receptors [70,71]. The liver is the main organ for clearing ApoE-binding lipoproteins; hence, systemically delivered LNPs would bind ApoE and preferentially home to the liver [36,72]. A study performed on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice using cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA demonstrated that the hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs is ApoE dependent, suggesting that LNP charge plays a role in LNP tissue tropism [73]. \n\nWhile excessive liver homing is a notable disadvantage of intravenously injected ionizable LNPs, a selective organ targeting (SORT) strategy could overcome this issue [74]. In this system, various lipid classes were designed for tissue-specific gene delivery and editing using CRISPR-Cas technology. Based on previous work, researchers speculated that the key to organ-specific delivery would be manipulating the internal and/or external charge of formulated LNPs [75][76][77]. Along with standard LNP components including an ionizable cationic lipid, phospholipids, cholesterol and PEG, the authors proposed adding SORT molecules which allow lung-, spleen-or liver-specific gene delivery. Indeed, adding increasingly higher percentages of permanently positively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane lipid (DOTAP) shifted tissue tropism from the liver to the lungs.",

            "text": "To elucidate why liposomal LNP mRNA systems exhibit longer circulation lifetimes, we characterized the biomolecular corona (BMC) adsorbing to the surface of the different LNP systems following incubation with mouse plasma. Using size-exclusion column chromatography (SEC), isolation of the plasma protein-bound LNPs was performed (Fig. S14). A ~2-fold higher (wt/wt) adsorption of plasma proteins was found for LNP with the Onpattro-like lipid composition as compared to the liposomal LNP system (Fig. 3A). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggested both formulations exhibited a broadly similar plasma protein profile (Fig. 3B, Table S4). Liposomal LNP formulations with other ionizable lipids such as ALC-0315 and SM-102 also showed a decrease in protein adsorption after SEC (Fig. S15). Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis detected over 1000 different proteins in the BMC of both formulations (Fig. 3C). Volcano plot analysis showed 98 proteins that are statistically different (P value = 0.01) between the two formulations. Notably, the liposomal LNP exhibit significantly lower immunoglobulin heavy variable 10-1 (Ighv10-1) and fibrinogen (Fgb) levels (Fig. S16). The classes of proteins adsorbed by liposomal LNP and Onpattro-like systems were similar but with a slight reduction in immunoproteins (~4.4% less) and a slight increase in apolipoprotein (~3.6% more) for the liposomal LNP as shown in Fig. 3D and Table S4 [21][22][23] . While the dominant contribution to prolonged circulation lifetimes correlates with the overall reduction in adsorbed plasma proteins, it is possible that the reduced levels of immune proteins and increased levels of apolipoproteins could also contribute to this effect.",

            "text": "Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.",

            "text": "ApoE, an endogenous lipid transportion protein, is reported to bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor superfamily, such as LDLr and LRP1r [23] . Currently, apoE-based nano-DDS was mainly concentrated on brain-related investigation by precoating native apoE or tween 80 on the NPs surface before intravenous injection [23,32,33] . Unfortunately, the apoE-precoating strategy is immunogenic and expensive, and still unable to effectively evade the uncontrollable plasma opsonization, and also evokes the following off-target distribution and nanotoxicity to a certain degree [34,35] . Tween 80-coated NPs are reported to preferentially adsorb serum apoE to NPs surface after injection [36] , but the physically absorbed tween 80 possess potential hemolytic and allergic activity, and is also easily desorbed in vivo [37,38] . In this study, we first incubated NPs with rat serum at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, isolated the adsorbed proteins by centrifugation and then determined the protein composition on NPs [26] . As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, PPD NPs and PP NPs (as control in our study) adsorbed 134 and 118 kinds of proteins, respectively, 57 of which existed in both NP coronas components. We then ranked the 20 most abundant proteins of NPs corona (Table 1 and Fig. 3 B), and discovered that the types and abundance of the adsorbed proteins in PPD NPs corona were different from that of PP NPs corona, which might confer NPs a different biological identity ( Fig. 3 C). To our surprise, we found that PPD NPs selectively recruited apoE from blood serum instead of transferrin or albumin ( Fig. 3 B and Table S2), and the apoE content on PPD NPs ( \u223c12.7%) was 4-fold higher than that on PP NPs ( \u223c3.2%). The interesting apoE-enriched corona might result from the combined contribution of size, zeta, shape, NPs surface feature and the complex biological milieu.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

            "text": "Neutral liposomes have been shown to bind to proteins in serum, exchange components with lipoproteins and acquire factors that can potentially target them to specific cell types [45,46]. In particular, they interact with apolipoprotein (Apo) E and A-I [47,48]. ApoE, but not ApoA-I or ApoA-IV, was further found to enhance uptake of neutral liposomes in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes [49]. The role of ApoE in LNP uptake into hepatocytes was confirmed in vivo using ApoE-deficient mice [50]. The authors demonstrated that LNP were cleared more slowly from the circulation and were taken up by hepatocytes at least 20-fold less in ApoE-deficient mice than in wild-type animals. Similarly, LNP siRNA systems containing ionizable lipids require ApoE for activity [51]. Silencing of Factor VII was compromised in mice lacking ApoE or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, suggesting that ApoE acts as an endogenous ligand for LNP siRNA systems that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor. \n\nWhen endogenous ligands are not available, exogenous ligands can be used to enhance uptake of LNP siRNA systems in target cells. Exogenous ligands such as antibodies, antibody fragments and peptides have been widely used in the field of liposome technology [52][53][54][55]. However, they are expensive and difficult to manufacture, as well as potentially immunogenic. In contrast, small molecule ligands conjugated to the distal end of PEG-lipids are simple to synthesize and can be formulated into LNP in a straightforward manner (Figure 2) [51,56,57]. N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) found on hepatocytes, have been shown to rescue gene-silencing activity of LNP siRNA systems in ApoE deficient mice [51].",

These interactions can enhance the uptake of LNPs by target cells, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic payloads such as nucleic acids or drugs. Since surface charge, size and lipid components of nanoparticles have been reported to modulate delivery to specific organs, researchers have created some modified LNPs that interact with endogenous proteins to provide tissue specificity [120,141]. When LNPs have a neutral surface charge, the formation of complexes between LNPs and apoE facilitates transport to the liver and uptake by hepatocytes and hepatoma cells through LDL receptors [202]. LNPs conjugated with apoE are successfully targeted the central nervous system, crossing the bloodbrain barrier and releasing an anticholinergic drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease [203]. In contrast, LNPs with anionic charge can be utilized to facilitate delivery to spleen via adsorption to \u03b22-glycoprotein I [204,205]. In addition, the different phospholipids not only affect LNP tissue-tropism but may also interfere with the biological process of protein translation [206].",

            "text": "As in hepatic targets, there are no direct carrier (ApoE) mediated targeting avenues for extra-hepatic targets. Several approaches, therefore, have been employed for non-hepatic targets. In this regard, selective organ targeting (SORT) has been explored by Dillard and coworkers [59], where a fifth component (or SORT molecule), in addition to the conventional four-lipid composition of LNPs, enables extrahepatic targeting of LNPs. The authors hypothesized that after desorption of PEG lipids on the LNP surface, the underlying SORT molecules are exposed and recognized by distinct serum proteins. These serum proteins then adsorb onto the LNP surface and lead the LNPs to the targeted organ by interacting with cognate receptors expressed by cells in the target organs, akin to the ApoE-based LNP accumulation in the liver. The group successfully demonstrated liver, spleen, and lung delivery, and has shown potential for other important delivery targets. The SORT molecule library also consists of lipids of diverse pKas. It was determined that 6-7 pKa lipids are best suited to liver targeting, greater than 9 pKa lipids are ideal for lung targeting, and 2-6 pKa lipids are best suited to spleen targeting [59]. \n\nMeyer et al. [60] have also thoroughly reviewed extrahepatic targeting for mRNA delivery, which was found be in concurrence with the SORT approach, where positively charged lipids and negatively charged LNPs were found to preferentially accumulate in the lungs and spleen, respectively. Additionally, poly-beta amino ester (PBAE) polymer [61,62], 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA) lipid, 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipid [63], and polyacrylic acid (PAA) polymers [64] were found to target the lungs by altering the PEG lipid, helper lipid, and N/P ratio.",

Extended evaluations of serum proteins include VENN diagrams (Figure S6A, Supporting Information), enrichment analyses (Figure S6B, Supporting Information), heatmaps (Figure S7, Supporting Information), and graphs for supplementary key proteins (Figure S8, Supporting Information). \n\nSince we found these clear links, i.e., of HP to apolipoproteins, we quantified the serum levels of different apolipoproteins and proteins functioning in lipid transport using targeted proteomics. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that all apolipoproteins were clustered in one branch and that these were either upregulated or unaffected compared to the untreated control (Figure 3A). We allocated the significantly affected proteins into four different groups: the first included those generally induced by siRNA-LNP such as APOD, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and lecithin-cholesterin acyltransferase (LCAT). The second group included proteins significantly affected by Ldlr deficiency such as APOB, APOE, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The third group was composed of proteins of the BLT1i-Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 group such as APOC4, lowdensity lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1, CD91), and C-reactive protein (CRP). APOC1, APOC3, and APOM  were significantly increased in the fourth group designated as BLT1i-Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 (Figure 3B). Except of APOA1, APOA2, and APOA4, all apolipoproteins were significantly affected by the siRNA-LNP (see Figure S9, Supporting Information, for the additional serum proteins). Synopses on the whole spectrum of elevated serum proteins from both untargeted and targeted proteomics including their regulation and significance are shown in Table 3.",

            "text": "Plasma lipoproteins include one or more protein constituents, known as apolipoproteins.\n\nApolipoproteins have been classified into several subgroups, including apolipoprotein A (ApoA), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein C (ApoC), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). These subgroups are themselves further sub-classified, for example: ApoA-I, ApoA-II etc. Each lipoprotein class is associated with certain apolipoproteins, for example: chylomicrons and VLDL are associated with ApoB; chylomicrons, VLDL and HDL are associated with ApoE. [76] The primary role of apolipoproteins is the transport and redistribution of lipids amongst various tissues in the body. Specific apolipoproteins are recognised by cell surface receptors, and this facilitates the high affinity binding required for delivery to target tissues. Certain apolipoproteins also act as cofactors of enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolic pathways, including those of lipoprotein lipase and lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), which catalyse the formation of cholesterol esters. Another role of specific apolipoproteins is the maintenance of the structure of lipoproteins, by stabilizing their micellar structure, and by providing a hydrophilic surface in association with phospholipids. [53] The function of apolipoproteins has provoked interest in their possible role in a range of degenerative conditions. In particular, several investigators have suggested an association between ApoE and various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and AMD. [77][78][79][80] Abalain et al. investigated the association between AMD and serum levels of lipoproteins and lipoparticles. [78] They found that there was no difference in serum ApoA-I and ApoB levels between AMD patients and controls. However, they found that serum ApoE levels were higher, and that serum ApoC-III levels were lower, in AMD patients compared",

Among the upregulated proteins in PDAC samples, the most significant differences corresponded to fibrinogen gamma chain (FIBG, MW = 52 kDa), serum amyloid A-2 (SAA2, MW = 14 kDa) and apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2, MW = 11 kDa), which were detected with larger relative protein abundances (RPAs) for at least one of the three liposomes. Finally, some proteins exhibited opposite trends, e.g., fibrinogen alpha and beta chains (FIBA and FIBB, MW = 95 kDa and MW = 56 kDa, respectively) were more abundant in PDAC coronas for the cationic liposome and in CTR coronas for the neutral one. The same trend was detected for apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3, MW = 11 kDa), while apolipoprotein E (APOE, MW = 36 kDa) and apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2, 11 kDa) were more abundant in cancer coronas for the anionic liposome and less abundant for the cationic and neutral formulations, respectively. We incidentally state that all those differences are simply evaluated by arithmetical subtraction of the detected RPAs on PDAC and CTR samples, protein by protein. Thus, the aforementioned dominant contributions are intrinsically related to corona proteins that were quite abundant (RPA \u2265 1%) in at least one of the investigated samples.",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

            "text": "espite the presence of IR and BC proteins, dysopsonins such as serum albumin were also found in the coronas of all samples. Albumin, as one of the most abundant proteins in serum tends to have high affinity with NPs and has shown to be useful in stabilizing the NPs and prolong their blood circulation time in vivo. 33,34 Clusterin was another type of protein found in all coronas. The protein was also reported to have dysopsonic properties, giving stealth effects to the NPs against phagocytosis. 35,36 Therefore, the presence of the albumin and clusterin could counter the activities from the IR and BC proteins mentioned above. Apolipoprotein is another interesting group of proteins. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E have been reported to have opsonin-like properties. 37 Despite that fact, the proteins also proved to be enhancing the abilities of NPs to cross the blood\u2212brain barrier through interactions with brain endothelial cells. 38,39 Therefore, enrichment of these lipoproteins could not only affect the circulation time of the SPIONs but also be beneficial when targeting the NPs to brain tissues. \n\nBy comparing the abundance of each discussed protein between each type of coronas (Figure 3E), B-SPIONs have the least affinity with the proteins, followed by the C-and Rf-SPIONs, respectively. This is in good agreement with the prior results observed from SDS-PAGE where the lane intensities followed the same trend (Figure 2). Although the physical properties and number of types of the proteins found on each SPION were not much different (Figure 3A\u2212D), the higher abundance of each protein suggested the effects of the coating materials such as citric acid and the Rf conjugate increasing the interaction of the SPIONs to the serum proteins. This increase in protein corona abundances could have a high influence on the NP behaviors when they are introduced in vivo, especially in terms of biodistribution and circulation time.",

The enthalpy of HSA binding to CKK-E12 LNPs (926 kcal/mol) was 2-fold higher than A6 LNPs (489 kcal/mol) (Fig. 2h). \n\nPrevious studies have shown that albumin-like moieties, including albumin-NPs, can bind preferentially to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18. This interaction facilitates endocytosis via the caveolae mediated pathway or via macropinocytosis 28 . To test whether our LNPs were internalized via an albumin-mediated pathway following albumin coating, we evaluated several cellular internalization pathways. We depleted key endocytic regulators using siRNA in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2i), and delivered our LNPs.",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

            "text": "To date, the vast majority of bio-corona studies have been conducted in vitro (55)(56)(57) and while this has served to underscore the importance of the acquired biological \"identity\" of nanomaterials as they encounter a biological environment, the in vivo relevance has remained obscure. However, in the past few years, several studies on in vivo bio-corona formation have emerged, thus shedding light on the impact of the biocorona on NP clearance or targeting (58,59), and its role for the toxicological outcomes of NP exposure (34,60). However, it is important to realize that differences in kinetics of NP clearance in humans vs. smaller species such as mice may result in more or less pronounced effects of bio-corona formation, and this needs to be taken into consideration when making interspecies extrapolations about the biodistribution of NPs (61). Moreover, the overwhelming majority of all bio-corona studies to date have focused on the protein corona, while other biomolecules including lipids or nucleic acids have been somewhat neglected. However, lipids, in particular, deserve special attention as they are key constituents of the cell membrane, and are involved in numerous signaling pathways. Hellstrand et al. (50) reported almost a decade ago that copolymer NPs [50:50 N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM):N-t-butylacrylamide (BAM)] bind cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids from human plasma, and noted that the lipid and protein binding patterns corresponded closely to the composition of natural, highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) complexes. HDL particles are nanosized protein complexes that transport lipids in the body, the most abundant apolipoproteins in HDL particles being Apo-AI and Apo-AII. It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63).",

            "text": "For instance, smaller NPs adsorb relatively more proteins compared to larger NPs due to having a larger surface area-to-volume ratio in smaller NPs. 227 Additionally, hydrophobic NPs adsorb more than twice the amount of proteins of hydrophilic NPs (12 vs. 26 \u03bcg of proteins per mg of NP, respectively). 228 Other studies showed that hydrophobic NPs have a higher binding affinity for apolipoproteins, while hydrophilic NPs favoured the adsorption of fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. 27,229 esearchers also found that hydroxylation can reduce the adsorption of certain proteins like HSA and IgE, which typically promote immune clearance, while maintaining the adsorption of ApoE, which prolongs circulation in the bloodstream. 230 Charged NPs can cause more protein denaturation than neutral NPs. 231 Studies on polystyrene NPs demonstrated that positively charged NPs have higher binding affinity to proteins with an isoelectric point of less than 5.5 (e.g., albumin), while negatively charged NPs prefer proteins with higher values (e.g., IgG). 232 Another study on various organic and inorganic NPs has demonstrated that their exposure to human serum albumin results in diverse corona formation and composition. These differences manifest in the hydrodynamic size of the NPs. 119 Porous particles decreased the amount of adsorbed proteins due to the size-exclusion effect. 227 In turn, coating NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), zwitterionic compounds or polysaccharides can also minimise protein adsorption. 233,234 owever, when targeting ligands are attached to the NP surface, serum proteins interfere with their binding to target cells. Conjugating targeting ligands to an equilibrated corona is an alternative to overcome the issue and enhance their binding. 235 n the other hand, the biomolecular corona can impact the NMs' physico-chemical properties and highly influence their circulation time, as well as their deposition in tissue.",

            "text": "The protein corona can also confer the targeting ability of NPs when certain proteins that have a high affinity to specific receptors can be recruited in protein corona, which might be a potential strategy to overcome the shortcomings of the current targeting delivery approaches. This mechanism is one of the factors that contribute to the success of Onpattro (patisiran), which is the first ever lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug for the treatment of hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis [36][37][38]. These NPs formulations show remarkable affinity to the liver and high hepatocyte accumulation, resulting from a large number of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) being adsorbed into the protein corona. The ApoE in the protein corona can act as natural and effective targeting ligands, which result in the uptake of NPs by endocytosis through ApoEdependent low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes [39]. Another example of controlling protein corona composition for targeting ability is the NPs system modified with transferrin (Tf)-binding peptide, which was rationally designed from several computational methods [40]. This peptide can effectively bind the Tf in the serum and endow the NPs with Tf-abundant protein corona without altering the original Tf biological function. The effect of protein corona modulation by this Tf-binding peptide would confer the brain-targeting ability to NPs system, and this approach was widely used in some following research [41][42][43]. \n\nAs a novel and potential method, biomimetic nanotechnology has shown its power and promise in drug delivery systems because it has the potential to overcome the obstacles associated with current nanomedicine. Current NPs are mainly synthetic and usually impeded by various physiological barriers and unexpected biological effects because of their exogenous nature [44][45][46]. Natural substances used in biomimetic nanotechnologies, such as viruses and cells, have evolved for some biological effects, which can be utilized in nanomedicine to overcome the disadvantages of synthetic NPs.",

            "text": "Systemic administration LNPs are an ideal delivery system for mRNA, whether administered intranasally or intravenously. A significant observation on mRNA-LNPs passively delivered to the lungs by intravenous administration is that the addition of cationic lipids alone can redirect mRNA-LNPs from the liver to the lungs. This finding is noteworthy as it suggests a feasible strategy for pulmonary targeting while decreasing off-target delivery to the liver. \n\nUsing the SORT strategy, Siegwart et al. [106,116,155] added 50% permanently cationic lipids containing quaternary amino groups, such as DOTAP, Dimethyldidodecylammonium bromide (DDAB), and EPC, into the traditional mRNA-LNP formulation that was initially intended for liver targeting. This modification enabled the redirection of LNPs towards pulmonary delivery. The addition of cationic lipids significantly elevated the pKa of mRNA-LNPs to nine, far exceeding pKa of liver-targeted mRNA-LNPs (six -seven). This modification successfully enabled the selective transfection of approximately 40% of lung epithelial cells, 65% of pulmonary endothelial cells, and 20% of pulmonary immune cells. LoPresti et al. [141] observed that replacing the standard helper lipids in LNPs with cationic lipid DOTAP similarly leads to an enhancement of lung tropism for mRNA-LNPs. The available evidence indicates that the pulmonary targeting outcomes achieved by adding cationic lipids and high pKa values are closely related to the changes in the surface protein coronas of LNPs. LNPs modified with quaternary ammonium groups [106,116,156] with high pKa values, lead to a change in the adsorbed protein corona from ApoE to vitronectin. This altered protein corona preferentially binds to the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin receptor, which is highly expressed in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, thereby making LNPs more prone to accumulate in the lungs [116]. \n\nA recent study has shown that incorporating cationic lipids as helper lipids in LNPs enhances their targeting specificity towards pulmonary endothelial cells [142].",

            "text": "Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

            "text": "At the same time, the pKa must be high enough to adopt a protonated state under acidic endosomal conditions. In addition, hydrolysable ester bonds are typically used for branching unit conjugation, providing increased biodegradability and, thereby, lower toxicity levels (Figure 4B) (Li et al. 2024;Semple et al. 2010). Lastly, the ionizable cationic lipids should be unsaturated. Since unsaturated tails promote interaction with endosomal anionic lipids, this interaction results in membrane lytic nonbilayer structures enabling cytoplasmic delivery (Koltover et al. 1998;Kulkarni et al. 2018). \n\nPEG-lipids play an important role during the LNP production process by dictating size and preventing aggregation after formation (Hald Albertsen et al. 2022;Kulkarni et al. 2019). For example, an LNP containing 0.25 mol% PEG-lipid displayed a particle diameter of 120 nm (Belliveau et al. 2012), while an increase in the relative PEG-lipid content to 5 mol% at the expense of cholesterol resulted in LNPs with a diameter of 25 nm. As PEG-lipids form a hydrophilic corona around the LNPs that prevents cell uptake, \"diffusible\" PEG-lipids with short dialkyl chains (C14) were developed that dissociate from the LNP in the presence of a lipid sink (Akinc et al. 2010;Schober et al. 2024). This enables LNPs to interact with components in the circulation and be efficiently taken up by cells following administration (Allison and Milner 2013). For example, apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to the LNP surface occurs following dissociation of the PEG lipids after systemic administration. This has been demonstrated using apoE knockout mice, where LNP-induced hepatic silencing efficacy is reduced compared to wild-type mice, an effect that can be rescued by incubating the LNP with apoE prior to administration (Allison and Milner 2013).",

However, another study found that despite pre-incubated with mouse serum before administration, CTAB-AuNRs mainly accumulated in liver (Cai et al., 2016). Some of the CTAB-AuNRs escaped the phagocytosis mainly due to the adsorption of mouse serum albumin in process of pre-incubation, but the particles were found in the hepatocytes. Interestingly, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSNs) loaded with perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) adsorbed more proteins than the bare particles, especially the amount of apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2. These proteins only induced ENPs to accumulate in liver 24 h after injection, but in other RES organs like spleen or lung (Pochert et al., 2017). In summary, the biodistribution of ENPs determines the organ/tissue specific therapeutic or toxic effects, and the PC formation plays an important role. Undesirable biodistribution of NPs in disease treatment applications will reduce their therapeutic effect and even induce toxicity. Therefore, controlling PC formation in nanomedicine can provide more precise guidelines for improving the specificity and efficiency of NPs for targeted biodistribution.",

To find the correlation between structural parameters, medium condition, protein corona, and cellular uptake of PECs, this set of PECs was selected for in vitro tests to simultaneously evaluate effects of D/Ch ratio, thiolation of dextran, Ch Mw, PEC size, and their zeta potential on cellular uptake of the PECs. Furthermore, effects of FBS and pH of the medium on uptake of the PECs were studied. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found out that uptake of the PECs was noticeably enhanced by FBS (p < 0.05). However, it was not significant for the thiolated PEC composed of Ch18 with D/Ch ratio of 0.2 in acidic medium, and Ch-DNA complex in the medium with pH, 7.4. Previous researches indicated that serum proteins influence uptake of nanoparticles by cells as the structurally same nanoparticles can lead to very different biological outcomes in the presence or absence of protein corona 55 . Herein, different parameters have reverse effects on the test results. First, FBS lead to an increase in uptake of the PECs because cell function rises by addition of serum. Second, interaction of nanoparticles with serum proteins leads to an increase in size of the nanoparticles and changes their surface properties such as zeta potential, consequently, it decreases PEC uptake. Third, existence of some proteins in corona such as inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins could enhance the cellular uptake 56,57 .",

The blood half-life of the DOPE-C8-LNPs was clearly less than 10 min (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, the biodistribution of the LNPs 1 h after intravenous injection was examined using IVIS (Figure 2D). The DOPE-Cx showed a significantly higher level of accumulation in the kidney compared with that when using DSPC, albeit at lower values. No differences between LNPs were observed for other organs. The highest accumulation was in the liver, which was followed by slight accumulations in the spleen and lungs. Intrahepatic distribution of the LNPs revealed that consistent levels of all LNPs accumulate mainly in hepatocytes, which are located in an area enclosed by blood vessels (Figure 2E). These results suggest that DOPE-C8 has a limited effect on the biodistribution of LNPs and that the improved mRNA expression level derives from intracellular processes such as endosomal escape. \n\nWhen nanoparticles such as LNPs are exposed to proteins such as blood, they form a protein-based layer on their surface, which is referred to as the biomolecular corona. [11] The physicochemical properties of LNPs affect their interactions with proteins and alter the biomolecular corona. The properties of the biomolecular corona are known to alter both the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of LNPs. [12] Reports also show that phospholipids such as DSPC are preferentially located in the outer layer of LNPs due to their bulky hydrophilic moiety compared with that of other lipidic components such as ionizable lipids and cholesterol. [13] egatively charged phospholipids are known to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs. [14] e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance.

An important function of apolipoprotein E is to facilitate the high-affinity binding of lipoproteins, such as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), a subclass of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and chylomicron remnants, to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (Mahley, 1988). Binding of lipoprotein particles to the LDL receptor facilitates the transport of cholesterol into cells via the internalization of lipoprotein particles. This is termed receptor-mediated endocytosis (Goldstein and Brown, 2009). Consistent with this function, elevations in plasma cholesterol levels are seen in individuals who lack either apoE (familial apoE deficiency) or have genetic defects in the LDL receptor (familial hypercholesterolemia; Schaefer et al., 1986;Goldstein and Brown, 2009;Pendse et al., 2009). \n\nApolipoprotein E is synthesized by most organs, including the lung. Macrophages, including CD68 + alveolar macrophages, express apoE (Mahley, 1988;Yao et al., 2010). Apolipoprotein E has been shown to modulate lung development in mice, as apoE knockout mice have diminished developmental alveologenesis, high airways resistance and more rapid loss of lung recoil with aging (Massaro and Massaro, 2008). \n\nIn the liver, hepatic parenchymal cells are the primary cellular source of apoE, where it is secreted as a component of VLDL particles (Mahley, 1988). ApoE is also expressed by astrocytes in the brain and is found in cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in smooth muscle cells where it may modulate cellular proliferation and differentiation (Mahley, 1988). Alveolar type I cells in the rat have also been reported to express apolipoprotein E (Chen et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the protein corona effects on the same protein in native and denatured states when conjugated onto NPs. There is limited information that explains why both MSN-Ni-TAT-SODn and MSN-Ni-TAT-SODd can adsorb similar quantities of serum proteins with only a slight difference in protein corona fingerprints; however, a significant difference in the RPAs was observed. We herein propose that the RPA difference between them may be attributed to a difference in the \u03b6 potentials (Figure 3c). Much fundamental research needs to be conducted in the future. \n\nTo understand the molecular functions of the identified corona proteins, LC\u2212MS/MS data were further processed according to eqs 1 and 2 and submitted to an IPA software analysis. Fold changes in the RPAs of corona proteins between RMSN-Ni-TAT-SODd and RMSN-Ni-TAT-SODn were analyzed. Significantly upregulated proteins in the corona of RMSN-Ni-TAT-SODd and their functions and localization are presented in Figure 6a. Among them are some important molecular transporters, including apolipoprotein E, \u03b2-2glycoprotein 1 (apolipoprotein H), apolipoprotein A4, apolipoprotein C3, and apolipoprotein A2, which are associated with cell membrane crossing. Apolipoproteins are specialized in lipid transport into the cytosol via scavenger receptors expressed on cell membranes, 60 that contribute to NP entry into cells through endocytosis. 20,31   endocytosis signaling was the second most significant enriched mechanism involved in molecular transport into the cytosol. This result is consistent with the endocytosis pathways analysis in Figure 4e,f.",

However, our data indicate a marked disparity in the efficacy of the nanoparticles used in these studies. LNP B provided much greater delivery of ARG1 mRNA to hepatocytes in vivo, resulting in higher arginase hepatic protein (as demonstrated by western blot and functional arginase activity) and greater improvement in control of ammonia, arginase, and guanidino compounds along with a more pronounced effect on quantitative myelination of the cingulum bundle and striatum. It is not clear why LNP A was markedly less efficient than LNP B in hepatocyte mRNA uptake and functional activity for both luciferase and arginase 1. While LNP A is efficient at expressing luciferase protein in muscle/peritoneum near the site of injection, previous investigations have demonstrated that arginase expression in myocytes is ineffective in extending survival and successfully treating arginase deficiency in mice. 43 The studies described in Figure 1 did demonstrate exposure of the luciferase mRNA-formulated LNP in extrahepatic tissues; however, outside of the liver for LNP B and the muscle at the site of the injection for LNP A, these were at a low level or modest at best. Very low levels were detected in the brain, with slightly more modest levels detected in the heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. These extra",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

            "text": "The data presented in this study suggest that apoE acts as an endogenous targeting ligand and plays a major role in the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of iLNPs (LNPs with near neutral surface charge at physiological pH), but not cLNPs (LNPs with positive surface charge at physiological pH). In vitro studies demonstrated that both uptake and subsequent gene-silencing activity of iLNPs were dramatically enhanced by the presence of apoE in the culture medium. Conversely, apoE had no effect on the uptake or gene-silencing activity of a cLNP control. These findings were corroborated by in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. The potent in vivo gene-silencing activity of the iLNP observed in wild-type mice was nearly completely abolished in apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas that of the cLNP control was unchanged. Although the cLNP control helped to establish the general RNAi competency of the apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, other factors unrelated to the loss of apoE as an endogenous targeting ligand (e.g., alterations in gene expression profile or serum lipoprotein composition) could potentially have accounted for the loss in iLNP activity observed in this strain. To rule these factors out, experiments were conducted whereby exogenous apoE protein was premixed with iLNPs before administration to apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. Exogenous apoE was found to fully rescue the activity of iLNPs in a dose-dependent manner, confirming that the loss of iLNP activity in apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice is indeed due to the absence of apoE as an endogenous targeting ligand.\n\nTo complement studies establishing apoE as an endogenous targeting ligand for iLNPs, we sought to study the receptor dependence of iLNP activity. Unfortunately, such a study is complicated by the fact that there are numerous potential receptors for apoE, whose activities may be redundant and for which the loss of one receptor pathway may be compensated for by other mechanisms. Nonetheless, the dependence of iLNPs on LDLR was studied in vitro and in vivo. Relative to uptake in wild-type primary hepatocytes, uptake of iLNPs was considerably diminished in LDLR \u2212/\u2212 primary hepa",

The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE(-/-) mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR(-/-))-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

However, a recent study assessed the changes of protein coronas on mRNA-LNP surface accumulated in spleen after repeated administration, and the result was the enrichment of immunoglobulins [188]. It suggests that immunoglobulins also play an important role in the protein coronas on spleen-targeting LNP surface. Whether the protein coronas act together or promote spleen targeting independently remains inconclusive. Negative charge on LNP surface increased the spleen targeting ability of LNPs. Kranz et al. [41] used DOTMA (cationic lipid) and DOPE (helper lipid) to form mRNA-Lipoprotein X (LpX)s. It was observed that mRNA-LpXs with a zeta potential around \u2212 35 mV generated a signal exclusively in the spleen, with no significant expression observed in the liver. LoPresti et al. \n\n[141] used phosphatidylserine as helper lipids, maintaining a four-component LNP system. The surface of these mRNA-LNPs displayed a weak negative surface charge, thus reproducing the same spleen tropism. \n\nFurthermore, the structures of ionizable lipids affect the protein expression of mRNA in the spleen. Fenton et al. developed an ionizable lipid OF-Deg-Lin containing biodegradable ester bonds (Fig. 12B) [189,196]. Although the mRNA-LNPs composed of OF-Deg-Lin accumulated stronger in the liver than in the spleen, the mRNA  [192] expression in the spleen was over 85% while being hardly expressed in the liver. The reason might be that the ester bond degraded quickly in the liver before inducing protein expression in the hepatocytes (e.g., during cell internalization). Conversely, OF-Deg-Lin-LNPs might have been preserved in the spleen, retaining their ability to generate functional protein expression following uptake in the resident splenic cells.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165].

            "text": "This increase in protein corona abundances could have a high influence on the NP behaviors when they are introduced in vivo, especially in terms of biodistribution and circulation time. This requires further investigation since, as discussed above that proteins such as albumin could help prolong the circulation time, while the high abundance of HDLs such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E could promote clearance through their opsonin-like properties. \n\nLastly, the uptake of the coronas in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was investigated. The results were compared between the uptake of preformed coronas and in situ coronas. By both treatments, corona@Rf-SPION showed the highest uptake activity, followed by corona@C-SPION and corona@B-SPION at almost every incubation time. The only difference was observed at the incubation time of 4 h, where by treating in situ, the uptake levels of all SPIONs were comparable, as opposed to the trend shown in preformed coronas. These different uptake patterns could be due to the delay in corona formation when the SPIONs were added in situ compared to the already formed coronas which were taken up faster. Therefore, this suggests the importance of corona proteins in facilitating the uptake of the SPIONs into the cells in a distinct manner between each type of SPION. \n\nFor other incubation times, Rf-SPIONs showed the highest uptake activity, regardless of the corona formation process. \u221242 Here, the results also showed that once the Rf-SPIONs interact with serum proteins, neither preformation nor in situ formation of the protein corona of Rf-SPIONs did affect the uptake efficiency of the particles. This is an interesting result as several works showed that formation of protein coronas could hinder the targeting efficiencies of NPs due to the coverage of the ligands, for example, in the transferrin-functionalized silica NPs. 43 hen comparing the uptake of each SPIONs (Figure 4A) with the protein abundance results (Figure 2B), the two factors tend to be correlated. The cellular uptake activity was found to be the highest in Rf-SPIONs, followed by C-and B-SPIONs, respectively, whose protein corona amounts followed the same trend.",

Further work will aim to validate the function of these high-abundance proteins in mediating lung selective delivery through the corresponding gene knockout mouse models. \n\nFurthermore, 24 down-regulated proteins that significantly correlated with TAR (p < 0.05) were also identified (Figure 4H). The liver-targeting LNPs primarily absorb proteins that are involved in lipid metabolism pathways, such as lipid transport, high-density lipoprotein particle clearance, lipid localization, and cholesterol efflux (Figure 4I). The liver tropism was identified to be significantly associated with Apoc4, Apoc2, Apoa2, and Apom (Figure 4J). Apoe was also listed as a typical protein dominating liver tropism, although the FC of abundance was not significant according to our analysis. [38] The dominant types of apolipoproteins appear to vary with the structure of ionizable lipids and the individual environment. Recently, the AstraZeneca team found that the hepatocyte targeting capability of Dlin-MC3-DMA LNPs may rely on Apoc4, Apoc2, Apoa2, and ApoB located in high-density lipoproteins, very-low-density lipoproteins, and chylomicron lipoproteins in obese rats, instead of the well-known Apoe. [39] We discovered that Apoc4, Apoc2, Apoa2, and Apom were all associated with hepatic-targeted delivery. The other proteins correlated with liver selectivity were also listed in Figure S156 (Supporting Information). \n\nThe physicochemical properties including LogP, LogD, Zaverage, pKa, and the morphology of representative LNPs were also characterized (Table S2 and Figures S157 and S158, Supporting Information). No significant dependency was found between the TAR and physicochemical properties, including LogP, LogD, Z-average, and pKa. The zeta potentials in PBS and H 2 O exhibited a moderate to strong correlation, with R values of 0.66, and 0.76, respectively.",

            "text": "How much protein will be produced from the mRNA template will initially be determined by the amount of intact mRNA that reaches the cytosolic compartment. This is where the LNP delivery technology comes into play. Upon administration, proteins and other biological components present in the extracellular space can bind at the surface of the mRNA LNPs. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid stabilizing the mRNA LNP system against aggregation during manufacturing and storage contains short acyl chains. This design facilitates that the PEGlipid rapidly dissociates from the LNP following injection, as an essential first step to allow cellular interactions [38,39]. Upon intravenous administration, Akinc et al. found that the surface of neutrally-charged LNPs is strongly enriched with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which leads to enhanced uptake by hepatocytes through low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [40]. There are good reasons to believe that ApoE binding also plays a critical role in the uptake of the mRNA LNP vaccines after intramuscular injection. Vaccine targeted cell types (see Mode of action), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, highly express LDL receptors and other scavenger receptors [41]. Moreover, the transfection of human DCs with mRNA LNPs in an in vitro setting was also reported to be promoted in the presence of ApoE [42]. Upon internalization, mRNA LNPs are routed through the endo-lysosomal compartment, where most of the mRNA LNPs remain entrapped in endosomes and degrade over time. The intracellular trafficking and underlying mechanisms on how LNPs enable the escape of mRNA from the endosomes to reach the cytoplasm are still not fully understood [43][44][45]. The hypothesis stands that the ionizable lipid components of the LNPs (pKa < 7) become protonated due to the acidic pHs in the endosomes, and leads to lipid exchange with anionic phospholipids of the endosomal membrane.",

The breakdown of the interesting proteins showed a similar trend of abundance in each type of coronas (Figure 3E). As the most abundant protein in the serum, we investigated the effects of albumin on the cellular uptake of the SPIONs. The results, shown in Figure S2, indicate no observable effects from the albumin coronas in the uptake of the SPIONs in the breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with prior studies where albumin is reported to affect cellular uptake in negative ways as it has the property of reducing the interaction of the NPs with the surroundings such as other proteins or cell membranes. 44,45 Although not affecting directly, it is possible that albumin acts by reducing the non-specific interaction of the NPs with the cells, thereby allowing the Rf ligand to promote the interaction with the cells and resulting in the enhanced uptake of the Rf-SPIONs. \n\nOther proteins that are possible to involve with the uptake of the NPs are apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E. The proteins were reported to enhance the uptake of NPs into brain tissues due to their specific interaction with the receptors overexpressed in the blood\u2212 brain barrier. 37,46 However, the effects were not demonstrated in breast cancer cells beforehand. \n\nHere, two hypotheses are suggested. One is that the coverage of the coronas did not affect the activities of the Rf ligand in promoting the cellular uptake activities. Another possible explanation is that there are distinct key components in the protein coronas of the Rf-SPIONs which help in increasing the uptake efficiency of the NPs into the cells. This requires further systemic analyses on the development of the coronas in vitro which could give more information on the proteins involved in the cell internalization processes. 47",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

LC-MS/MS analysis revealed different protein corona compositions among functionalized and non-functionalized nanoparticles, with the 8D3-PLGA-thiazolidinedione and 8D3-PLGA nanoparticles being the only types of nanoparticles containing afamin and with ApoE and ApoA-I adsorbed into their protein corona. Afamin may play an important role in regulating vitamin E uptake, favoring its transport across the BBB.

            "text": "We depleted key endocytic regulators using siRNA in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2i), and delivered our LNPs. A6 LNPs were mostly internalized through Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC-1)-mediated macropinocytosis and partially through ApoE-low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 2i). In contrast, cKK-E12 LNPs and Syn-3 LNPs relied on caveolae (CAV)-mediated endocytosis (through CAV1) (Fig. 2i). This was observed when incubating cKKE12 containing LNPs with albumin (Fig. 2j), but not with ApoE (Fig. 2k), confirming that albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis facilitates the uptake of LNPs containing cKK-E12. Finally, the mRNA delivery efficiency of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs was reduced in a dose-dependent manner during co-culture with a strong gp18 and gp30 competitor, fucoidan 29,30 , further validating our hypothesis (Fig. 2l). Overall, the above study demonstrates that the addition of A6 lipids in LNP formulations does not significantly affect the mechanism of endocytosis. In contrast, cKK-E12 lipids govern the mechanism of cellular uptake; through endocytosis of the Syn-3 LNPs via an albuminloaded protein corona. Syn-3 lipids with optimal ratios of cKK-E12 can maintain their stability and facilitate albumin binding, and are internalized through these endocytic pathways. \n\nFormulations with optimal membrane fusion and endosomal escape. The cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs showed similar levels of intracellular uptake (Fig. 2d), yet protein expression was superior in the Syn-3 LNP system containing the lipid A6 (Fig. 2e). This suggests that inclusion of A6 lipids in the LNP may increase expression by some other mechanisms.",

Opsonins such as complement proteins and immunoglobulin adsorption will facilitate nanomaterial removal from the plasma while adsorption of dysopsonins such as bovine serum albumin, apolipoproteins will enhance the circulation time via avoiding the mononuclear phagocyte system. Barr\u00e1n-Berd\u00f3n et al. (2013) performed timeevolution studies for investigating the adsorption of different types of proteins to the surface of NPs Their findings indicate that apolipoproteins (Apo A-1, Apo C-II, Apo D, and Apo E), complement component proteins (C1q, C1r, C1s, C3OS, C4-B OS, C5OS, C6OS, C7OS, C8 Alpha Beta and gamma, C9OS, BOS, HOS, and I OS), fibrinogen (alpha, beta, and gamma), and several additional serum proteins, including IgG, serum albumin, serotransferrin, and vitronectin may be associated with the externally introduced NPs (Barr\u00e1n- Berd\u00f3n et al., 2013). Lundqvist et al. (2008) showed that polystyrene NPs (PSNP) adsorb to different plasma proteins using mass spectrometry analysis. In general, large 100 nm PSNPs were found to complex with immunoglobulins while smaller 50 nm particles were found to be complexed with apolipoproteins, suggesting that particle size may determine the kind of protein corona acquired by the particles and their role in enhancing the removal from or extended stay in the circulation.

These observations have important implications as bound apolipoproteins or entire endogenous HDL complexes may carry NPs to the SR-B1 receptors, expressed by liver cells and macrophages.",

            "text": "For long-distance information transport, exosomes and microvesicles are of interest as vehicles. Exosomes are derived from endosomal compartments named multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas microvesicles directly bud from plasma membranes (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2018(Th\u00e9ry et al., , 2002)). During long-distance transport, EVs encounter biological fluids, such as blood, and proteins likely adsorb to their surface. This is referred to as protein corona formation. The adsorbed protein corona can ultimately alter the EV functionality as observed for many nanoparticles. This has been largely neglected in the field of EV research. The formation of an EV protein corona was first described by T\u00f3th et al. who revealed the protein composition as well as demonstrated the influence of a protein corona on EV functionality (T\u00f3th et al., 2021). Shortly after, this was confirmed by Wolf et al. who demonstrated that a protein corona is necessary for EVs to reach their full potential in angiogenesis and wound healing assays (Wolf et al., 2022). These findings started a paradigm shift from viewing plasma-derived proteins as contaminants of EV preparations towards considering them as additional EV components. \n\nPresumably, the insights into the protein corona formed on nanoparticles also will benefit the functional understanding of the EV corona. Nanoparticles quickly adsorb proteins upon contact with biological fluids. This changes their chemical identity to a biological identity and ultimately alters their biodistribution and cell uptake (Walczyk et al., 2010). Distinct proteins regulate the uptake of nanoparticles. Apolipoproteins, a class of lipid-binding proteins abundant in human blood, are known to promote a prolonged blood circulation time by avoiding uptake in phagocytic monocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Gustafson et al., 2015). This has also been referred to as stealth effect. In contrast, so-called opsonins, such as immunoglobulins mark nanoparticles for uptake in phagocytes (Yang et al., 2013).",

[90]enerally, the mere presence of a certain lipid does not reliably predict enrichment of the theoretically associated serum protein, given that its surface display is a prerequisite.This adds complexity to the translation of findings across different NPs, since not only the components but also their ratios affect their struc-tural organization, [91] and consequently, the corona formation of these particles.Thus, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between NP structure and corona composition is essential.Expanding on this, the presence of certain proteins within the corona does not imply a functional role.Indeed, protein binding to NPs can cause structural alterations of said proteins, rendering them biologically inactive. [92]While it is exceedingly challenging to predict how the protein corona might alter the NPs fate, incremental progress in understanding presents opportunities for novel therapeutic and diagnostic avenues.\n\nThus far, endogenous targeting has proven effective in directing NPs to the liver, spleen, and lungs.To extend the application of this strategy toward additional tissues, further investigations connecting protein corona composition and biodistribution are required.",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34 kDa protein with functions in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and intracellular lipid disposal. Extracellularly, apoE is a key mediator of the internalization of lipoprotein particles, serving as a ligand for the LDL receptor (1,2) and the LDL receptorrelated protein (LRP) (3,4). ApoE is also internalized by binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) alone (5,6) or via a mechanism involving both HSPGs and LRP (7,8). Intracellularly, apoE modulates lipid metabolism (9,10) and functions in the routing of internalized lipoprotein remnants (11,12). In addition, it is involved in both the assembly (13,14) and secretion (15,16) of VLDLs. ApoE also plays a critical role in cholesterol efflux from macrophages (17)(18)(19)(20), a role that could be due to both intracellular and extracellular effects. Because apoE can easily transfer between lipoproteins and binds tightly to its receptors, we and others hypothesized and proved that a substantial amount of internalized apoE escapes lysosomal degradation and is routed into the secretory pathway. \n\nWe have established that a portion of apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, as well as on HDL, is spared degradation and recycled (21)(22)(23). We also demonstrated that internalized apoE is found in the media of hepatocyte cultures from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow (22), a proof that systemic apoE can be retained by the liver cell and is eventually regurgitated. In addition, we reported that apoE was resecreted from apoE \u03ea / \u03ea hepatocytes after incubation with apoEcontaining mouse VLDL (23). The fact that apoA-I stimulated apoE resecretion from hepatocytes suggests a role for recycling apoE in HDL metabolism (23).",

            "text": "Despite an abundance of preclinical studies on nanomedicines, its clinical translation is still limited. One of the possible factors may be the formation of a \"protein corona\" on nanoparticles. It is widely accepted that once nanoparticles are systemically administered, they encounter serum components, such as proteins, resulting in the formation of a protein corona on the surface [137,138,141,146,[251][252][253][254]. Protein corona formation is a double-edged sword, which means controlling them can be applied to more effective targeting [51,54,55,[148][149][150][151][152][153][154] although protein corona formation on the nanoparticle surface may adversely affect the targeting [147]. With regard to brain targeting, ApoE is a well-known endogenous ligand, and brain delivery using nanoparticles with suitable affinity for ApoE has been conducted. As mentioned above, polysorbate-80 coated nanoparticles can bind to ApoE and enter the brain via a LDLR-mediated pathway [51,[155][156][157]]. There appears to be two modification modalities for controlling the protein corona, pre-coating before injection and controlled corona formation in the circulation. As an example of the former, it was reported that pre-ApoE4 decorated nanoparticles showed an improved brain accumulation compared to un-decorated nanoparticles [51]. However, random protein adsorption can cause access to the receptor-binding pocket to be inhibited [255,256]. It is thought that this can be avoided if the interaction mode of protein adsorption on nanocarrier-surface can be controlled. The latter example is that precisely manipulating the binding pattern of brain targeted apolipoproteins on the nanoparticle surface resulted in superior brain accumulation and showed a therapeutic efficacy in a glioma tumor model [54].",

Upon coming in contact with biological fluids (e.g. blood), nanocarriers are rapidly covered by biomolecules (proteins, lipids, etc.) which results in the formation of a surface layer, widely known as the biomolecular corona. The biomolecular corona subsequently confers a certain biological identity to the corona-covered nanocarriers which can be crucial during their subsequent interactions with cells or other biological entities. In contrast to the proteins of the corona, little is known about the impact of the non-protein constituents of the corona, such as sugars. Here, we investigate the role of protein glycosylation of the corona in cellular uptake. We show that deglycosylation of clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein AI (Apo AI) significantly changes (increases and decreases, respectively) the cellular uptake of nanocarriers covered with these proteins.",

            "text": "Complement C4-A and C4-B (CO4A and CO4B) were found to be significantly downregulated in all the PDAC coronas, while complement component 3 (CO3), C4b-binding protein (C4BPA), and platelet basic protein (CXCL7) were significantly downregulated in PDAC samples for two out of three liposome formulations. Among the upregulated proteins in PDAC samples, the most significant differences corresponded to fibrinogen gamma chain (FIBG), serum amyloid A-2 (SAA2), and apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), which were detected with larger relative protein abundances for at least one of the three formulations. Fibrinogen alpha and beta chains (FIBA and FIBB) were more abundant in PDAC coronas for L1 and in \"control\" coronas for L3. The same trend was detected for apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), while apolipoprotein E (APOE) and apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) were more abundant in cancer coronas for L2 and less abundant for L1 and L3, respectively. Motivated by these findings we explored the personalized protein corona of graphene oxide (GO) nanoflakes in the human plasma of pancreatic cancer patients [32]. GO was chosen due to extraordinary physical-chemical properties that prompt researchers to apply it in disease-related diagnostics [33]. In our investigation, we focused on previously unexplored factors (e.g., GO lateral size) that shape the GO-PC in biological media. Notably, protein apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) was the most enriched plasma protein. That protein was already recognized as a potential biomarker for PDAC [34]. Other representative proteins detected included serum albumin (ALB), hemoglobin (subunit B and A1, HBB and HBA1 respectively), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (SER-PINA1).",

            "text": "Thus, it appears very likely that these RNA-binding proteins were induced by the siRNA-LNP. The hepatic induction of Saa1 and Saa2 suggests that these two proteins, which can function as apolipoproteins, [35] contribute to the specific immune-cell tropism of the siRNA-LNP that occurs upon treatment with the HDLRi. Moreover, SAA is lipidated by hepatocytes, what suggests that SAA may function by binding to the siRNA-LNP, and may thereby affect transport processes. Furthermore, the plasma clearance of SAA occurs more rapid than that of the other major HDL apolipoproteins, ApoA1 and ApoA2. [35] This suggests a role of SAA1 and SAA2 in the transport of siRNA-LNP. \n\nThe reduction of proteins functioning in drug and lipid metabolism in the liver and serum suggests that they mediate the degradation of the siRNA-LNP since it is known that CYP2A4 and CYP2A5 are associated with lipid metabolism. [36] The SULT proteins function in the sulfonation of various molecules what generally increases their water solubility and reduces their toxicity. [37] hus, SULT2A1 might be involved in degrading parts of the LNP lipid fraction and their consumption in biochemical reactions may explain their deprivation in the liver and serum. \n\nThe reduction of serum opsonins (IGLC3, IGKC, GM5571, IGLC2, and IGHV3-6) might be owed to their unspecific binding to the siRNA-LNP. Particularly, IGLC2 is present at the protein corona of PEGylated LNP. [38] Comparable findings exist for IGLC3, [39] and IGKC. [40] Immunoglobulins are abundant serum proteins and it has for instance been shown that IGKC belongs to the 25 most abundant serum proteins. [40] We thus hypothesize that these proteins indeed bind to the siRNA-LNP and impact their clearance. \n\nWe are aware that our study has limitations.",

            "text": "Apolipoproteins are polar, and thus can travel in polar medium (an aqueous medium) despite being non-polar (lipophilic) in nature. Apolipoproteins interact with receptors and lipid transport proteins to participate in lipid processing and metabolism. They also serve as cofactors of enzymes participating in lipid metabolism. \n\nThere are various classes of apolipoproteins which are present on different types of lipoproteins and regulate their functions. Among them, ApoE has a role in the central nervous system. It plays a role in lipid homeostasis and transports cholesterol to neurons via ApoE receptors. ApoE is produced by microglia and astrocytes, whereas in the peripheral system, it is produced by liver and macrophages. Once ApoE is secreted from cells, the ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCA1 and ABCG1) import cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent ApoE to form lipidated apolipoprotein particles. ApoE acts as a ligand for low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) (e.g., ApoE receptor and LRP1) and very low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLR). ApoE binds with A\u2424. LDLR and VLDLR enable ApoE-A\u2424 complex to pass through them by interacting with them and participating in the clearance of A\u2424 from the brain [3,15]. ApoE has different isoforms which have been classified on the basis of difference in amino-acids at positions 112 and 158. E2 has cysteine at both the position, while E3 has cysteine at 112 and arginine at 158 position. It has a better binding affinity for LDLR to mediate lipolytic processing. E4 has arginine at both the positions due to which repulsion occurs between arginine 61 and arginine 112. This enables the formation of a salt bridge between arginine 61 and glutamate 251. Salt bridge disrupts normal functioning of apolipoproteins. E4 binds with VLDLR with better affinity which internalizes the ApoE-A\u2424 complex at a slower rate than LRP1.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time. Indeed, despite proteins of the complement cascade not seeming to be involved in modifying the clearance of nanoparticles as shown by wild type and complement protein 3 (C3) knockout mice, different results were obtained with apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The latter belongs to a class of proteins hardly adherent to the nanoparticle surface. A low PEG density was associated with a high deposition of ApoE in vivo, with a consequent reduced clearance. An opposite effect was noticed in high PEG-covered nanoparticles or in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 animals with a resultant higher nanoparticle opsonization and elimination. The LDL receptor (LDLR) also showed to interfere with nanoparticles distribution and elimination rate independently from the PEG density. In fact, LDLR \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice or pretreatment of the experimental animals with a strong LDLR binder such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) increased the nanoparticle circulation time when compared to the control. \n\nRecently, the formation of a personalized protein corona started to be considered not only as an obstacle for proper nanoparticles targeting but also as an emerging tool for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic personalized nanomedicine. In this context, Ren and co-workers reported a proteomic study in which polyanionic gadolinium metallofullerenol (Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 ) nanoparticles were used for the analysis of the composition of the protein corona in 10 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma [101]. Interestingly, results led to the identification of C1q, a protein of the complement system, as the most bound biomarker to the surface of Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 nanoparticles. Binding of C1q Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 nanoconstructs led to the disruption of the secondary structure of the protein, nanoparticle endosomal internalization, and enhanced activation of the immune system.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

            "text": "This is caused by flow-induced rolling in shapes with high ratios, which results in edge margination at a speed proportional to the NP aspect ratio 3 . Even after vessel localization, architecture-dependent drag force from blood flow may rip NPs from cell membranes if they lack sufficient binding affinity for endothelial cells 88 . Thus, the haemodynamics experienced by systemically administered NPs -which are often altered in vascular pathologies such as stenoses and hypertension 93,94 -greatly influence NP distribution and delivery. \n\nIn addition to their interactions with vessel walls, circulating NPs come into contact with biomolecules and cells suspended in blood. The non-specific adherence of serum proteins and lipids forms a corona on the surface of NPs 61,95,96 . The composition of the corona depends on the biomolecules present in blood as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the NP surface, as this dictates the adsorption or desorption of proteins from biological fluids 61,96 . At times, the engineered surface properties meant to enhance NP targeting -such as conjugated ligands or modified surface charge -may encourage corona formation through charge-specific interactions 97 . Once formed, this corona will dictate the distribution of the NP, and can compromise stability of both the NP and its cargo 61,96,98 . Recent investigations have sought to determine how the specific corona biomolecules alter NP distribution and tissue-specific targeting [99][100][101] . For example, coronas containing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) act as targeting moieties for low-density lipoprotein receptors, which leads to NP delivery to hepatocytes and, in some instances, across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 99,[102][103][104] . If the corona contains opsonin or ligands for pattern recognition receptors, it can cause rapid clearance of the NPs via contact with cells of the innate immune system 98 . \n\nClearance of NPs from the circulation can be influenced by their physicochemical properties, but often results from interactions with the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) or reticuloendothelial system 3,97 (fig. 3).",

            "text": "By adjusting the ratio of lipids in LNPs, the targeting ability of LNPs to different organs can be tailored. Siegwart et al. [62] discovered that modifying the composition and components of LNPs allows for the selective targeting of organs. These passively targeted LNPs are termed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, facilitating controlled nucleic acid delivery to specific tissues. Lung-targeting SORT LNPs feature a notably different protein corona from liver-targeting LNPs, with a reduced enrichment of ApoE, complement components, and immunoglobulins as well as increased enrichment of vitronectin (Vtn) among other proteins [63] (Figure 4). SORT LNPs contain SORT molecules and can accurately regulate delivery to the mouse liver, lungs, and spleen after intravenous injection [64] (Table 2). Siegwart et al. [65] conducted an exploration of the targeted mechanism of SORT LNPs. They speculated that different SORT molecules may cause LNPs to absorb different plasma proteins, thereby achieving tissue-specific mRNA delivery. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona of different SORT LNPs revealed that the main proteins adsorbed by LNPs from the liver, lungs, and spleen were apolipoprotein E (apoE), vitronectin, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I, respectively. This suggests the potential to elucidate the targeting mechanism in extrahepatic tissues. Flux screening represents another method for developing tissue-specific LNPs. Dahlman et al. [66] developed a research strategy called the Joint Rapid DNA Analysis of Nanoparticles, utilizing DNA barcodes and sequencing techniques. This strategy enables the high-throughput screening of LNP formulations by encapsulating unique DNA sequences. Each LNP formulation is associated with a unique DNA barcode sequence. Using flow cytometry and nextgeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67]. \n\ngeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67].",

Emerging protective gene variants, such as APOE Christchurch and the COLBOS variant of REELIN, an alternative target of certain apoE receptors, offer novel insights into resilience against AD. In recent years, the role of apoE has been shown to extend beyond its primary function in lipid transport, influencing multiple biological processes, including amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, autophagy, cerebrovascular integrity and protection from lipid peroxidation and the resulting ferroptotic cell death. While the detrimental influence of apoE \u03b54 on these and other processes has been well described, the molecular mechanisms underpinning this disadvantage require further enunciation, particularly to realize therapeutic opportunities related to apoE. This review explores the multifaceted roles of apoE in AD pathogenesis, emphasizing recent discoveries and translational approaches to target apoE-mediated pathways. These findings underscore the potential for apoE-based therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate AD in genetically at-risk populations.",

[82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

            "text": "The enhanced uptake of the siRNA by the Ly6C high monocytes upon HDLRi pretreatment indicates that Ly6C high monocytes transport the siRNA from the circulation into the liver where this subset of monocytes differentiates into MoMF and DC. [28] In contrast, the HDLRi-mediated uptake acceleration by KC that originate from the liver was much lower than by the MoMF and DC that continuously are replenished in the liver by monocytes. 11a] Taken together, the two different small molecules apparently act on critical points of LNP biodistribution and thereby enable shifting the balance of siRNA-LNP accumulation to either liver or immune cells, respectively. Recent research pointed out in a large screening of LNP formulations that interactions of RNA-LNP apart from APOE affect their tendency of enrichment in different cell types. [29] In line with this, our proteome data indicate that the levels of APOE as such cannot explain differences in the uptake that we observed between the different experimental conditions. We therefore assume that other proteins, particularly those in serum such as HP or SAA, that are functionally linked to APOE have an indirect but more important impact on the transport processes of RNA-LNP. It is very likely that HP plays a key role, because it is both a ligand of APOE [30] and a component of HDL particles. [31] hile the role of HP for LNP transport remains to be studied in more detail, the transportation function for LNP by association with APOA1, APOC2, APOD, and APOE was demonstrated before. [32] It is of course not surprising that RNA-binding proteins were induced by siRNA-LNP. It was stated that 2961 genes encode for such proteins in humans. [33] Particularly IFIT1 and ISG15 have been reported to have an RNA-binding function before. [34] Thus, it appears very likely that these RNA-binding proteins were induced by the siRNA-LNP.",

            "text": "The opsonization is part of the innate immune system, enhancing the activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) to clear pathogens from the body. This welldocumented phenomenon, observed with all nano-objects, is a rapid process, leading to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of nanovectors, with a dynamic remodeling over time in blood [78][79][80][81]. Proteomics analyses performed on various NPs incubated with serum demonstrated that numerous plasma proteins (>100 different proteins and peptides) bind onto nano-vectors, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation factors, and many others [78][79][80][81]93]. Authors have brought evidence that the protein corona formation and dynamics might depend on the physicochemical features of the nanovectors, including rigidity, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic surface, as well as charged or neutral zeta potential [93]. Proteins interact with NPs by different mechanisms, mainly electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding [93]. Lipoproteins, especially apolipoproteins E and A-I, are particularly enriched in NP's protein corona, most likely through direct interaction with lipids, in case of liposomes and lipid NPs [94,95], as well as the hydrophobic core of polymeric NPs [78][79][80][81]. Interestingly, reports have recently shown that proteins within the corona, including the ApoE, induce structural rearrangements that may impact their cell internalization and overall biodistribution in vivo [93]. \n\nIn order to reduce opsonization and scavenging by MPS, NPs have been optimized through the modulation of their size, shape [2], surface charge [96], and chemical structure [97][98][99], including the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block.",

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

This favors the hypothesis that ApoC2 and ApoC3 are present within the analyzed sample due to having been eluted together with liposomes as part of VLDLs and chylomicrons. ApoE is probably eluted as a part of HDLs which normally can be separated by SEC under conditions that we used [96], yet some of it either contaminates the liposome-protein corona samples or is part of the coronas. \n\nApolipoprotein H, or \u03b22-glycoprotein 1, is a 38.3 kDa phospholipid-binding protein with a plasma concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The main function of \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 is to bind phosphatidylserine on the surface of activated platelets and apoptotic cells. ApoH dimers bound to phosphatidylserine are recognized by antiphospholipid antibodies, which cause complement activation and attract phagocytes [97,98]. WB showed that none of our samples accumulated ApoH (Figure 12b), and the positive control lane has the only band corresponding to the protein dimer. At the same time, liposomal corona should be enriched with ApoH compared to the plasma blank sample, according to LC-MS/MS data (Figure 9). Relative protein content according to iBAQ intensities obtained in the LC-MS/MS experiment is 0.1% for the MLPH and 5SX samples and much lower for the other two; ApoH absolute content in WB samples could have been below the limit of detection.",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

The amount of serum albumin, fibrinogen and complement on the protein corona in the PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs and PTX/PMs group was higher compared to other proteins on the protein corona. Surprisingly, it was also noted that the relative quantity of apolipoproteins absorbed on PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs increased with respect to PTX/PMs. The weight percentage of apolipoproteins in the PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs group was 1.87%, which was 5.02-fold higher than that of PTX/PMs group. Importantly, the weight percentage of ApoE in the apolipoproteins absorbed on the surface of PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs was 13.3%, twofold higher than that of absorbed on the PTX/PMs (Fig. 4B). Thus, the weight percentage of ApoE was 0.247% in the PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs group. In contrast, the weight percentage of ApoE in the PTX/PMs group was 0.024%.

On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies.

            "text": "Recently, many studies have focused on the exploitation of \"conjugated lipoprotein nanocarriers,\" directly embedding apolipoproteins or apolipoprotein biomimetic peptides on the carrier surface and then actively targeting lesions. For example, solid lipid NPs functionalized with ApoE possess highly efficient infiltration properties in the brain; ApoA-I-mimicking peptide (D4F)-modified NPs show substantial potential in tumor homing and penetration. However, the formation of a protein corona may present significant obstacles to the clinical translation of ideal drug candidates. \n\nFortunately, in addition to some inert plasma proteins, numerous functional proteins are still adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers. \n\nGenerally, two functional regions exist in exchangeable apolipoproteins (such as ApoE, ApoA1, and ApoJ): lipidbinding and receptor-binding regions. Moreover, one of the mechanisms of A \u03b2 clearance in AD relies on linking the lipid-binding region and exposing the receptor-binding region, followed by crossing the BBB and discharging into peripheral blood via receptor-mediated transport. Peripheral ligands can also be transported to the brain via the bidirectional transport of related receptors. These theories may provide an opportunity to select the binding modes of apolipoproteins on nanosurfaces to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Recently, Zhan et al. developed a novel brain-targeted liposome modified with A \u03b2protein biomimetic nontoxic peptide to achieve highly efficient brain targeting. In blood circulation, functionalized liposomes can actively absorb the lipid-binding region of targeted endogenous apolipoproteins and the receptor-binding area is exposed on the liposome surface. Furthermore, when loading doxorubicin, the conjugates (SP-sLip/DOX) exhibited significant enhancement in both lesiontargeting biodistribution and anti-tumor efficacy (gliomas and medulloblastoma), prolonging the median survival period of model mice.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics are an emerging class of innovative medicines that offer the potential to potently and specifically reduce the expression of disease-causing genes, including those which are currently considered \"undruggable\" with small molecule or monoclonal antibody modalities. The key to fulfilling this potential is the safe and efficacious delivery of shortinterfering RNAs (siRNAs), the molecules that mediate RNAi, to specific cell types and tissues. In recent years, significant progress has been made to overcome some of the obstacles associated with in vivo delivery of siRNA, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent one of the most advanced technological platforms. 1 Earlier work has established that siRNAs formulated in LNPs can successfully silence therapeutically relevant genes in nonhuman primates, 2,3 and a class of LNPs, termed \"stable nucleic acid lipid particles\", is being utilized in multiple liver-targeted RNAi programs in human clinical trials. More recently, we reported the discovery of novel ionizable 4 and cationic 5 lipids with significantly improved activity for next generation LNP-siRNA delivery systems. The discovery of both ionizable and cationic classes of lipids that mediate efficient LNP delivery of siRNA warrants the distinction of ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) and cationic LNPs (cLNPs).\n\nThe relative success of LNPs for liver delivery of siRNA molecules can, at least in part, be attributed to the favorable physiology of the liver, a well-perfused organ with a fenestrated endothelium. On the other hand, LNPs are known to interact with serum proteins, exchanging components and acquiring proteins in circulation that can potentially direct LNPs to specific cell types. 6,7 Apolipoproteins, for instance, were found to be generally adsorbed onto neutral liposomes, but only apolipoprotein E (apoE) was capable of enhancing uptake into hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes. 8 More recently, Yan et al. have described the role of apoE in the clearance of neutral liposomes by hepatocytes in vivo. 9 ApoE is found on ch",

            "text": "Binding to lipoproteins is thermodynamically preferable for ApoA1, but it also circulates as a free protein in plasma. ApoA1 level in plasma is similar to that of C3 and is about 1-1.5 mg/mL, which makes it one of the most abundant plasma proteins [94]. \n\nIn the blot obtained with anti-ApoA1 antibodies (Figure 12a), there is a specific ApoA1 band at 25 kDa and a not specific one, a bit lower than 37 kDa for all liposomes samples. We believe that the latter can be due to primary antibody cross-reactivity to ApoE (34 kDa). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE, 34 kDa) is a part of several classes of lipoproteins; it is involved in lipid metabolism throughout the body, including brain and nerve cells. Its plasma concentration is identical to that of factor I, 0.04 mg/mL, which is more than 25 times less abundant than ApoA1. Nonetheless, ApoE is a rather frequent component of the liposome protein coronas [41]. Researchers attempt to utilize ApoA1 and ApoE recognition by brain cells as a way for targeted delivery across BBB [95]. Apolipoprotein H, or \u03b22-glycoprotein 1, is a 38.3 kDa phospholipid-binding protein with a plasma concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The main function of \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 is to bind phosphatidylserine on the surface of activated platelets and apoptotic cells. ApoH dimers bound to phosphatidylserine are recognized by antiphospholipid antibodies, which cause complement activation and attract phagocytes [97,98]. WB showed that none of our samples accumulated ApoH (Figure 12b), and the positive control lane has the only band corresponding to the protein dimer. At the same time, liposomal corona should be enriched with ApoH compared to the plasma blank sample, according to LC-MS/MS data (Figure 9).",

            "text": "The biological interactions between nanoparticles and circulatory proteins lead to the formation of \"protein corona\" [ 153 ]. This effect influences the nanoparticles uptake (via selective receptor-mediated targeting), lysosomal/endosome escape, transcytosis across the BBB/penetration across the BBTB, intracellular trafficking, and exocytosis from BCECs etc. Certain studies reported that targeted synthetic nanoparticles, although they enter the tumor cells, however, they lose brain tumor targeting specificity due to alterations in their protein structure, orientation, and/or functions. The binding of nanoparticles to opsonin, such as immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, complement components (C3/C4), etc., showed rapid clearance from RES and subsequently triggered immune responses. For instance, folic-acid receptor-targeted liposomes lose their specificity by macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in non-target tissue due to enhanced endogenous IgM corona on the surface of the liposomes [ 154 ]. Similarly, Xiao et al. in their findings, reported that transferrin-targeted nanoparticles reduced their ability to target transferrin receptors in vitro studies. Furthermore, they decided to investigate the impact of this protein corona against brain drug delivery. They found that the composition of protein corona was significantly altered after BBB transcytosis (that recapitulated the in vivo brain targeting) in theirBTB model. This in vitro and in vivo discrepancy in targeting specificity was probably due to the absorption of another protein like apolipoproteins (e.g., apolipoprotein A-I) on the surface of the transferrin-targeted nanoparticles, improving their permeability across the BBB. Collectively, these findings suggested the potential of protein corona in improving the targeting across the BBB and guiding the in vivo fate of the nanoparticle [ 155 ]. More interestingly, chimeric protein modification adopted by biomimetic/bioinspired drug delivery systems was reported to decrease the influence of biomolecular corona due to their surface occupancy.",

            "text": "The delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

            "text": "Background The interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and plasma proteins form a protein corona around NPs after entering the biological environment, which provides new biological properties to NPs and mediates their interactions with cells and biological barriers. Given the inevitable interactions, we regard nanoparticle\u2012protein interactions as a tool for designing protein corona-mediated drug delivery systems. Herein, we demonstrate the successful application of protein corona-mediated brain-targeted nanomicelles in the treatment of glioma, loading them with paclitaxel (PTX), and decorating them with amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2)-CN peptide (PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs). A\u03b2-CN peptide, like the A\u03b2 1\u201342 peptide, specifically binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in vivo to form the ApoE-enriched protein corona surrounding A\u03b2-CN-PMs (ApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs). The receptor-binding domain of the ApoE then combines with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and LDLr-related protein 1 receptor (LRP1r) expressed in the blood\u2013brain barrier and glioma, effectively mediating brain-targeted delivery. Methods PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were prepared using a film hydration method with sonication, which was simple and feasible. The specific formation of the ApoE-enriched protein corona around nanoparticles was characterized by Western blotting analysis and LC\u2013MS/MS. The in vitro physicochemical properties and in vivo anti-glioma effects of PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were also well studied. Results The average size and zeta potential of PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs and ApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were 103.1\u00a0nm, 172.3\u00a0nm, 7.23\u00a0mV, and 0.715\u00a0mV, respectively. PTX was efficiently loaded into PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs, and the PTX release from rhApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs exhibited a sustained-release pattern in vitro.

(2011) showed that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)conjugated gold NPs bound fibrinogen from blood plasma and induced its unfolding, which in turn activated the receptor macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) on THP-1 cells, causing release of inflammatory cytokines via the NF-\u03baB pathway (Deng et al. 2011). \n\nWhen performing a detailed identification of plasma protein binding to copolymer NPs, Cederval's group in 2009 showed that HSA, despite its higher concentration that is reflected by initially more abundant binding, is rapidly replaced by the higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins AI, AII, AIV and E. Furthermore, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) bind to copolymer NPs with much higher affinity than other lipoproteins, probably mediated by apolipoprotein A-I, which is its major component. In brief, together with the alternate proteinbinding patterns in the corona, copolymer NPs bind complete HDL complexes and may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes (Hellstrand et al. 2009). Albumin is the major protein adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes, whereas the targeting of albumin to scavenger receptors is well known. Targeting of the scavenger receptor pathway by a single-walled carbon nanotubes-albumin-complex could result in interference with the innate immune response (Dutta et al. 2007). However, while common proteins can bind to different NPs, the biological outcome may not be the same (Deng et al. 2013). Both protein's structure and NP type contribute to bio-corona fate during intra-cellular uptake by target cells. Firstly, serum proteins are adsorbed onto the surface of NPs and protein structure can be modified during this step. For instance, a change in the secondary structure of BSA adsorbed on cationic polystyrene NPs forwards the protein-NP complex to scavenger receptors of the target cell.",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a multifunctional glycosylated protein characterized by its wide tissue distribution. Despite its importance in lipid transport and atherosclerosis pathogenesis, apoE is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease, and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Among others, the role of apoE in modulating inflammation and oxidation is crucial in elucidating the risk factors of the above diseases since the function of apoE is closely linked with both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, apoE modulates inflammatory and immune responses in an isoform-dependent manner. Correspondingly, inflammatory cytokines can either upregulate or downregulate the production of apoE in various tissue types. However, studies on the interactions between apoE and cytokines occasionally yield conflicting results, highlighting the complex roles of apoE and cytokines in various disorders. The present paper summarizes the current knowledge about the cross-talk between apoE and cytokines, with emphasis on the effects of apoE on the Th1/Th2 balance.",

            "text": "One of the larger LNP formulations kept a constant DSPC area/molecule (1.2 nm 2 ) in the shell, while the other presented a variable DSPC surface density. These formulations were dosed to cells (adipocytes and hepatocytes) to compare their protein production ability. While the level of encapsulation of mRNA per LNP was similar in the two series of formulations, the protein expression was higher when surface area per DSPC was kept to 1.2 nm 2 in both cell lines (Figures 4a and b). Based on this result, the authors suggested that the surface composition of mRNA-LNPs is key for efficient protein production. Subsequently, using a surface-sensitive characterization technique (QCM-D), the extent of protein binding to LNPs was determined, and the binding affinities of various apolipoproteins to mRNA-LNP were ranked [39]. It was found that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) binding to mRNA LNP formulations correlated with protein expression in vitro upon mRNA-LNP dosing [6] (Figures 4b and c). The results confirmed the key role of ApoE in cellular uptake of mRNA-LNPs and the importance of the surface structure of mRNA-LNP in the binding to ApoE, as suggested earlier [6]. \n\nOther studies reported that the choice of helper lipid can affect both structure and function of the resulting LNP (Figure 4d). In particular, the use of unsaturated helper lipids instead of saturated ones in the LNP formulation resulted in higher luciferase expression in vitro, and this was linked to a larger structural remodelling upon pH decrease for the LNP containing unsaturated helper lipid than for the LNP containing DSPC [41]. The latter was quantified by the structural change in LNP taking place when changing the pH from 7.4 to 4 as measured by SANS; the so-called Euclidean distance in the structure feature space. \n\nAnother recent study shows that the type of sterol used also influences LNP structure and function [42].",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "The therapeutic efficiency of these LNPs in treating inflammatory bowel disease was demonstrated, where targeted expression of interleukin 10 was observed in inflammatory leukocytes that are only present in inflamed tissues [104,105]. \n\nAlthough the inclusion of targeting ligands has been shown to enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficiency of mRNA-LNPs, it should be noted that attaching targeting moieties may add complexity, cost, and regulatory difficulties to the process of manufacturing LNP systems [106]. In addition, the targeting specificity of some targeting ligands may disappear when lipid nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids where interaction with proteins in the media and the consequent formation of protein corona takes place [107]. Therefore, a compromise between the possible clinical benefits and the complexity and cost of the targeted mRNA-LNP manufacture should be taken into consideration. \n\nSome studies proposed that interaction of nanoparticles with opsonic blood proteins (i.e., opsonization) can be employed as a passive approach for targeting antigen-presenting cells [108,109] or to generate potent activation of dendritic cells through complement interactions in vaccine platforms [110]. A study conducted by Reddy et al. [110] demonstrated that intradermal injection of ultra-small ovalbumin nanoparticles as a vaccine platform resulted in targeting and activation of the dendritic cells residing in lymph nodes through complement interactions [110]. The authors concluded that intradermal administration of ovalbumin nanoparticles into mice may induce only humoral immunity via targeting lymph nodes and complement activation. \n\nThe differences in site-specific targeting and organ distribution after systemic administration of mRNA-LNP formulations can be attributed to the biomolecular corona and surface charge of LNPs. For example, adsorption of apolipoprotein E as a targeting ligand led to specific hepatic uptake of (si)RNA from ionizable (or near neutral) LNPs, but not from cationic LNPs [111].",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

            "text": "Furthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties.

            "text": "For instance, the chemotherapeutic Doxil, which is encapsulated doxorubicin, greatly enhances the circulation period of the drug [34]. Recently, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) to encapsulate mRNA have also proven to be a huge success as a novel class of vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [35]. Additionally, the clinically approved LNPs that are most famous at the moment are based on lipid encapsulation, i.e., the COVID-19 vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, are lipid nanoparticles [35]. LNPs enter the cells by binding to the LDL-receptor aided by apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which stimulates its uptake significantly [36]. As the LDL-receptor is not only expressed on hepatocytes, but also on other cells like antigen-presenting cells, LNPs can target a variety of cell-types to exert its effects and modulate lipid and/or inflammatory mechanisms (Figure 1). Another lipoprotein that has been encapsulated into LNPs for receptor-mediated uptake is ApoA1, which has been extensively discussed in another review [37] and which will therefore only be briefly highlighted here. ApoA1 is the main protein that is present in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and is taken up in the liver via the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1). Conveniently, NP uptake via SR-B1 can be achieved by engineering reconstituted HDL (rHDL) NPs containing various structures of ApoA1, which can alter the biological behavior of the NP [38]. One approach involves the use of ApoA1 mimetic peptides that contain amphipathic helix motifs comparable with those of ApoA1 or ApoE [39]. Some of these mimetic peptides have been shown to improve reverse cholesterol transport via ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) [40,41].",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64].

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR \u2212/\u2212 )-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoEbased endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

            "text": "There are alternative pathways that can be used to deliver bioactive agents to the brain. For example, intranasal delivery is an innovative approach that circumvents the BBB, offering benefits such as improved brain drug delivery, reduced systemic exposure, and reduced side effects. [237,238] Delivering LNPs via the nasal route shows potential in enhancing brain drug delivery, yet several challenges, such as the clearance of mucociliary and pulmonary effects, need to be resolved for their widespread use and application. [238] he presence of protein corona poses a significant challenge and opportunity for enhancing targeting efficiency and brain accumulation. Specific protein corona formed on LNPs in the presence of biological fluids can strongly affect their biodistribution as well as intracellular fate. Xiao et al. [239] observed in an in vitro study that the Tf-mediated BBB transcytosis targeting ability was completely lost after protein corona formation. However, interestingly, they found that targeting ability in vivo partially remained after protein corona formation. Recently, corona-mediated BBB targeting has emerged as a promising avenue by precisely modulating the interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on the nanoparticle surface. [240] The BBB crossing could be enhanced by binding Apo, particularly Apo A-I, to NPs. Zhang et al. [240] developed brain-targeted liposomes by modifying their surface with a peptide derived from A1-42, which specifically interacts with exchangeable Apo. Consequently, plasma Apo A1, E, and J could be absorbed on liposomes, thereby exposing the receptor-binding domain of Apo and facilitating brain-targeted delivery. Notably, Dox-loaded functionalized liposomes exhibited significantly enhanced brain distribution and demonstrated superior anti-brain cancer efficacy compared to non-functionalized Dox-loaded liposomes. The ability to engineer protein corona on specific LNPs is still elusive. Furthermore, the correlation between specific protein corona and enhanced BBB crossing and brain tumor accumulation is not yet completely mapped out.",

Dendrimers have delivered RNA to the central nervous system 168 , acted as intramuscular vaccines against the Ebola and H1N1 viruses 169 , and deli vered siRNA to hepatic endothelial cells 170 . Dendrimer structure has also been modified to protect nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation 171 and to enhance endosomal escape 172 .\n\nActive versus passive tissue targeting Passive tissue targeting. As outlined in the section 'Lipids and lipid-based nanoparticles' , research has demonstrated that LNPs originally developed for liver siRNA or mRNA delivery can be redirected to other organs without the need for antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers or other active targeting ligands that bind specific receptors on the surface of target cells 173 . For the purposes of this Review, we define such retargeting, probably driven by interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins in endogenous trafficking pathways, as a process termed 'passive targeting' or 'endogenous targeting' (Fig. 4a). As a sphere becomes smaller, its surface area to volume ratio increases; as a result, nanoparticles have large surface areas 174 and when a nanoparticle comes into contact with a biological milieu, many biomolecules can coat its surface 175 . By covering the nanoparticle surface, these coronas (proteins that bind to the nanoparticle surface) change the chemical and biological molecules at the surface of the nanoparticle, thereby altering how the nanoparticle interacts with immune cells 176 and on-target tissues 177 . In one clinical example 178 , apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption was required for ionizable, but not cationic, lipids to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes 179 . Researchers have found LNPs that can be trafficked via an albumin-dependent mechanism 180 as well as LNPs with variable dependence on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and caveolin-1 receptors 136,181 . In addition to the effect that the protein corona can have on LNP tropism, LNP size can also contribute to passive tissue targeting.\n\nIn one example,",

            "text": "Lysine N-pyrrolation, converting lysine residues to N \u2440 -pyrrole-L-lysine, is a recently discovered post-translational modification. This naturally occurring reaction confers electrochemical properties onto proteins that potentially produce an electrical mimic to DNA and result in specificity toward DNAbinding molecules such as anti-DNA autoantibodies. The discovery of this unique covalent protein modification provides a rationale for establishing the molecular mechanism and broad functional significance of the formation and regulation of N \u2440 -pyrrole-L-lysine-containing proteins. In this study, we used microbeads coupled to pyrrolated or nonpyrrolated protein to screen for binding activities of human serum-resident nonimmunoglobin proteins to the pyrrolated proteins. This screen identified apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a protein that innately binds the DNA-mimicking proteins in serum. Using an array of biochemical assays, we observed that the pyrrolated proteins bind to the N-terminal domain of apoE and that oligomeric apoE binds these proteins better than does monomeric apoE. Employing surface plasmon resonance and confocal microscopy, we further observed that apoE deficiency leads to significant accumulation of pyrrolated serum albumin and is associated with an enhanced immune response. These results, along with the observation that apoE facilitates the binding of pyrrolated proteins to cells, suggest that apoE may contribute to the clearance of pyrrolated serum proteins. Our findings uncover apoE as a binding target of pyrrolated proteins, providing a key link connecting covalent protein modification, lipoprotein metabolism, and innate immunity. \n\nProteins undergo covalent modification by reactive metabolites, such as oxidized fatty acids and intermediates of glycolysis, under physiological and pathophysiological conditions (1). The modification of proteins exerts a major impact on their chemical properties, leading to important functional and regulatory consequences. The \u2440-amino group of lysine, one of the three basic residues critical for protein structure and function, is a major target of covalent modification.",

            "text": "To evaluate the efficacy of ionizable lipid candidates to deliver RNA in cells, we formulated six different LNPs with mRNA encoding firefly luciferase (mFLuc). Before cellular transfection using HeLa cells, formulated LNPs (241C10 to 246C10) were incubated with apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) at the concentration of 0.1 \uf06dg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. apoE3 is a major isoform of ApoE in human (34). As shown in fig. S4 (A to D), ApoE adsorption resulted in the increase in size of LNPs, confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement. It is well known that lipoproteins are associated with LNPs in blood and enhance the cellular uptake of LNPs via LDL receptors (LDLRs). HeLa cells are known to express LDLR on their surface (15). Six hours after LNP treatments, cells were lysed with Bright-Glo reagent and the relative intensity of luciferase expression was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2A, 244C10, 245C10, and 246C10 showed substanial luciferase expression and 246C10 LNPs showed the highest luminescent expression. In serum-containing media, the role of ApoE was not significant (Fig. 2B), whereas in serum-free media, ApoE incubation resulted in the increase in luciferase expression (Fig. 2C). Although preincubation of 244C10 and 245C10 LNPs with ApoE slightly enhanced the FLuc expression (100-fold), preincubation of 246C10 LNPs with ApoE showed the marked increase in FLuc expression by 400-fold. To further investigate the cellular uptake mechanism of LNPs, intracellular uptake of LNPs was inhibited with anti-LDLR antibody (Fig. 2D). The significant inhibition was observed only with 246C10 LNP formulation. These findings suggested that cellular uptake of 246C10 LNPs was mainly mediated by interaction between ApoE and LDLR.",

            "text": "LNP typically consists of four components, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper phospholipid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids [86].\n\nThese four components can form stable nanoparticles to encapsulate and protect vulnerable mRNA. Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNP technologies can achieve targeted delivery by adjusting the stoichiometry of LNP components, which was exemplified by the success in lymph node-targeting delivery of mRNA in mice [92].\n\nOther strategies, like additional non-lipid components in LNP formulation, also contribute to the",

            "text": "Neutral LNPs have shown an increased preference for cellular uptake compared with highly positive or negatively charged LNPs due to electrostatic repulsion in the presence of phospholipids and proteoglycans in the cell membrane [17,18]. Cell uptake of LNPs is also influenced by LNP interactions with endogenous proteins such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can direct LNPs to hepatocytes via receptormediated endocytosis by low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R) [2,3]. This may explain why HEK293 cells (known to produce ApoE and well-known for their high transfection efficiency) display high expression in our studies, whereas HeLa cells, which do not produce ApoE (though they express ApoE receptors [19]), showed comparatively lower expression. Differentiated THP-1 cells can also produce ApoE. However, the expression pattern is heterogeneous, with approximately 5% of the cells overexpressing ApoE, which subsequently results in apoptosis of the cells [20]. However, C12-200 has been reported to undergo cell uptake via an ApoE-independent, micropinocytosis pathway [21]. Love et al. also investigated the mechanism by which C12-200 LNPs are internalised, specifically using HeLa cells [22]. In their study, C12-200 particles encapsulating siRNA were incubated in the presence of labelled cargoes known to enter cells by different endocytic pathways. \n\nTheir results suggested that C12-200 was internalised via a macropinocytosis mechanism due to membrane ruffling, and actin rearrangement was observed in the cells. \n\nFollowing cellular uptake, efficient protein expression depends on successful endosomal escape, which is influenced by the pKa and chemical structure of ionizable lipids [23]. Cone-shaped ionisable lipids, characterised by a small head group and broader tail, disrupt the organisation of cylindrical lipids in the endosomal membrane. This incompatibility leads to membrane destabilisation, facilitating mRNA release into the cytosol for subsequent translation.",

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

            "text": "A recent study has shown that incorporating cationic lipids as helper lipids in LNPs enhances their targeting specificity towards pulmonary endothelial cells [142]. Once endothelial cells are saturated, the LNPs target other cell types such as pulmonary immune and lung epithelial cells. Additionally, this study proposes an interesting hypothesis that the pre-treatment of cells may affect the in vivo distribution of mRNA-LNPs. Researchers have discovered that cells can alter their response to mRNA-LNPs by altering the processing of mRNA and subsequent protein production, such as translation initiation, complex formation, ribosome scanning, and initiation codon recognition. However, this hypothesis requires further in vivo experimentation for validation. \n\nSimilarly, Qiu et al. [143] found that through the modification of the ionizable cationic lipid tail structure, specifically by introducing an amide bond (N-series LNPs), the delivery specificity of mRNA-LNPs can be accurately tuned to target the lungs with a high degree of precision. Among them, 306N16B LNPs exhibited the highest targeting ability. Their protein coronas mainly consisted of serum albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2 chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3 chain. Based on these findings, fibrinogen was speculated to play an important role in directing pulmonary endothelial cell targeting, Previous studies have shown that fibrinogen coating can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelialization [157], which is consistent with the findings of Qiu's study. However, besides fibrinogen, the potential involvement of other proteins remained unclear, and further investigation is required to determine whether a single protein or multiple proteins act in concert. Additionally, modifying the head structure of N-series LNPs allows for selective targeting of various types of lung cells including pulmonary endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells (Fig. 9A) [143]. \n\nOverall, in the absence of active ligands, the addition of cationic lipids and structural variations in cationic lipids can both impact protein coronas adsorbed onto the LNP   surface, thus affecting their organ-level and cellular-level targeting.",

            "text": "Addition of PEG to the NP surface has been reported to markedly reduce formation of the protein corona by 79% (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). However, the uptake of PEG-NPs by macrophages was only blocked if PEG-NPs were first incubated with serum proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). Subsequent analysis revealed that the binding of clusterin to the surface of PEG-NPs was largely responsible for the inhibition of macrophage uptake (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). PEG therefore appears to confer immune stealth by altering the composition of the protein corona rather than by simply suppressing formation of the protein corona. Moreover, it is possible to direct NPs to the brain by enriching their surface with plasma proteins such as apolipoproteins (ApoA, E, and J). Using liposomes, this was achieved by modifying their surface with a short non-toxic peptide derived from Amyloid \u03b2 1\u221245 (Amyloid \u03b2 25\u221235 ) that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins (Zhang et al., 2019). This strategy which increases the surface content of apolipoproteins has been shown to enhance the brain delivery and anticancer effectiveness of doxorubicin compared to nonmodified liposomes in mice bearing U87 cells (Zhang et al., 2019). Incorporation of Amyloid \u03b2 25\u221235 has also been reported to have similar benefits for PLGA NPs (Zhang et al., 2019). These finds suggest that modification of the NP surface to encourage the binding of plasma proteins that cross the BBB may be a useful approach to harness the protein corona for targeting drugs to the brain. 9. Strategies for overcoming intracellular barriers 9.1. Promotion of NP endosomal escape Depending on the cell type and the composition of the cell surface, NPs can be internalized by clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis (Zhao and Stenzel, 2018). Once inside the cell, NPs either fuse with lysosomes or are recycled back to the cell surface, making endosomal escape a key barrier to delivery of the therapeutic payload (Pichon et al., 2010).",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

            "text": "Synthetic nanoparticles and EVs in biological milieus are surrounded by layers of adsorbed biomolecules, collectively referred to as the biomolecular corona. [82] The corona dynamically changes as nanoparticles traverse between various extracellular and intracellular compartments in the body. [83] The components in the biomolecular corona impact the biological identity of EVs, including immunological recognition and clearance (Figure 5). In particular, opsonins in the blood circulation play pivotal roles in mediating nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle uptake by innate immune cells. [84] Opsonins include complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and coagulation factors. Such opsonins may also cause a cascade effect where one opsonin causes the binding of others. For example, immunoglobulins on the biomolecular corona of synthetic nanoparticles attract complement proteins. [85] Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that EVs released by metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit a substantial abundance of complement protein H (regulator of the alternative complement pathway). [86] Complement protein H on these EVs facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by suppressing the activation of other complement proteins, resulting in evasion of the complement system. Therefore, the addition of complement regulatory factors on the EV surface may offer a promising approach to mitigate the complement response and reduce immunological recognition and clearance, as shown for synthetic nanoparticles. [87] Furthermore, decreasing the cholesterol content of EV mimetics reduced the adsorption of complement on the surface, [88] indicating that cholesterol content may also impact the immune clearance of EVs. \n\nOther abundant components in the biomolecular corona of EVs are lipoproteins and/or their protein components (apolipoproteins). [83] Varying affinities for lipoproteins impact the interactions between EVs and cells, including immune cells. [89] Lipoproteins are considered a major contaminant of EVs due to overlapping physical characteristics, [90] and methods have been developed to reduce lipoprotein abundance following EV isolation.

            "text": "Different NPs have different properties and behave differently when taken up by the liver to target HCC cells. With regard to this, inorganic NPs such as iron oxide and zinc oxide NPs have shown higher surface-to-volume ratio resulting in increased surface charges that promotes cellular uptake; however, these are more prone to oxidation, and therefore require either a short circulation time or surface modifications to avoid oxidative degradation. At the same time, inorganic NPs often require active targeting and offer limited delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and peptides, and it is not feasible to encapsulate nucleic acids using this type of NPs. On the other hand, lipid NPs have shown superiority in HCC targeted delivery and are preferentially being used for various reasons. First, lipid NPs have a natural affinity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) due to their structural resemblance to lipoproteins. ApoE is a protein that is involved in fat metabolism in the liver and lipid NPs exploit this characteristic to specifically target liver cells enhancing cellular uptake and distribution to hepatocytes. When lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enter the bloodstream, they come in contact with ApoE-rich lipoproteins such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein, which possess ApoE on their surface. Hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces facilitate the binding of LNPs to ApoE that leads to the formation of complexes recognized by low density lipoprotein receptors on the liver cell surface. In response, this triggers receptormediated endocytosis, causing internalization of ApoE-LNP complexes into HCC cells through clathrin-coated pits. Within the cell, these complexes are subsequently transported from early to late endosomes where the acidic environment of the later prompts the dissociation of ApoE from the LNPs. At this stage, LNPs need to undergo endosomal escape bypassing lysosomal degradation and to release its cargo. Endosomal escape occurs in various ways such as: 1) proton sponge effect, 2) membrane fusion, 3) disruption of endosomal membrane integrity, and 4) escape through exocytosis. 22",

            "text": "Since siRNA specifically inhibits the target protein functions via the specific cleaving of the target mRNA, it has been receiving significant attention as an anti-cancer agent. To date, there have been several successful and unique reports for treating tumors using LNPs. Before the development of LNPs (siRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles), siRNA was delivered to the target organs via systemic administration by attaching siRNA onto the particle (liposome) surface (lipoplex) [118,119]. Since the accumulation of lipoplex in a tumor relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [120,121], the surface of the lipoplex can be modified with a hydrophilic PEG polymer to increase its circulation time after intravenous injection; otherwise, the lipoplex is rapidly captured by the reticuloendothelial system. On the other hand, it was reported that LNPs without a large amount of PEG modification are highly effective for liver targeting [28,122,123]. LNPs prepared with ionizable lipids form a protein corona in the bloodstream [124]. ApoE in the protein corona is recognized by receptors such as LDLR, which are overexpressed by hepatocytes [125]. Then, the complexes are internalized into hepatocytes via the ApoE-LDLR pathway [28,122,123]. Since the formation of the protein corona in the bloodstream is important for the liver targeting of LNPs, only a small amount of PEG modification (~1% as a molar ratio) of the LNP is standard protocol in the case of liver targeting. This means that the PEG modification for liver targeting is not for obtaining long circulation of LNPs after systemic administration but for increasing their stability in the bloodstream, such as by inhibition of aggregation.\n\nIn general, ionizable lipids in LNPs are positively charged at lower pH (pH~6.0); therefore, highly hydrophobic LNPs tend to aggregate at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A small amount of PEG modification increases LNP stability in the bloodstream and may not inhibit ApoE binding in the bloodstream. For example, Huang et al. prepared polymerlipid hybrid",

Vitronectin, a multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein [36], had high affinity with the positively charged cNPs [37], and it was enriched in the protein corona of the cNPs we tested. Another plasma protein highly enriched in the cNPs' protein corona was apolipoprotein (15% or above) which associates with lipid and cholesterol transport and metabolism [29].

However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

When in the circulation, some types of LNPs bind to serum proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which, in turn, binds to the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor. This receptor is highly expressed on hepatocytes and directs the LNP siRNA into these cells. 34,35 However, a fraction of the LNP siRNA is taken up by Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and stellate cells, resulting in a significant amount of siRNA not accumulating in hepatocytes. 36 This can be largely avoided by changing the lipid composition in the LNP siRNAs; e.g., by using appropriate cationic aminolipids. 37 In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of LNPmediated delivery of anti-adenoviral siRNA to the liver for treatment of hAd5 infection in vivo. Initial experiments revealed that two siRNAs, sipTP mod and siPol-1 mod , targeting the adenoviral pTP or Pol gene, which contained 2\u02b9-O-methyl residues, phosphorothioate linkages, and an optimized thermodynamic profile, efficiently inhibited hAd5 infection in vitro. For in vivo use, sipTP mod was encapsulated in LNPs containing the cationic aminolipid XL-10 (LNP-sipTP mod ) and applied concomitantly with hAd5 to immunosuppressed Syrian hamsters. This treatment resulted in distinct inhibition of hAd5 replication in the liver, reduction of hepatic inflammation, normalization of liver transaminase levels, as well as reduction of hAd titers in the blood serum compared with hAd5-infected animals that received a nonsilencing control siRNA (LNP-siContr mod ).",

            "text": "e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance. [15] Thus, phospholipids have a significant influence on the quality of the biomolecular corona, which has a major impact on the behavior of LNPs in the body and on functional mRNA delivery. Therefore, it could be surprising that the replacement of DSPC with DOPE-C8 had a small effect on the biodistribution of LNPs as well as on the functional delivery of mRNA. Although experimental validation is required, it is possible that DOPE-Cx, a derivative of DOPE with a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain attached to its hydrophilic head, alleviated the preferential localization to the LNP outer layer. Phospholipid-free or -low LNPs undergo ApoE-dependent rapid hepatic clearance. [16] Therefore, in the present study LNPs containing 10 mol% DOPE-C8 might not have shown significantly different in vivo behavior. On the other hand, the effect on the biomolecular corona in formulations with high DOPE-Cx content or in combination with other phospholipids is interesting and merits further study.",

            "text": "This review highlighted the role of apoE in cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological health and diseases. In particular, we reviewed literature that showed how apoE deletion and/or polymorphism contribute to disease pathogenesis (Summarized in Table 1). The key features underlying the role of apoE in health and diseases include: (i) its function as a ligand transport protein, (ii) its function as a signaling molecule via binding to cell surface receptors and proteoglycans, (iii) its intracellular role in modulation of cell homeostasis, and (iv) its role in regulation of inflammatory response. Mechanistic insights gained from these studies may be harnessed to optimize treatment strategies for subjects with a high risk of cardiometabolic and neurological diseases due to APOE gene polymorphism. Several approaches, such as the use of apoE mimetic peptides [180], apoE4 structural correctors [179], modulators of apoE trafficking pathways [181], apoE antisense oligonucleotides [182] and APOE gene therapy [183] have been proposed and tested in preclinical models with various efficacies. The challenge of these approaches is the specific targeting to appropriate tissues and cell types, where their effectiveness can be optimized without any adverse effects. Finally, it needs to be emphasized that despite the preponderance of evidence showing the importance of apoE functions in health maintenance, and how its deletion in mice or polymorphisms in human accelerates disease pathogenesis, apoE is not required for development and apoE-deficient mice survive and develop to maturity without major health issues. The deleterious effects of apoE dysfunction are revealed at later stages after exposure to environmental factors and with different lifestyle choices [184]. Taken together, these observations infer the presence of alternative pathways that serve similar functions as apoE and suggest that apoE is a genetic modifier that acclerates chronic metabolic diseases.",

            "text": "This evidence suggests that mRNA vaccines can damage cardiomyocytes and induce the release of cTnI and NT-proBNP, though histopathological changes in cardiac muscle may vary based on susceptible doses, host species, type of mRNA vaccine, administration route, and other experimental conditions. Interestingly, our results showed that the increase in serum cTnI and NT-proBNP levels was significantly higher in IM-injected mice compared to IV-injected mice. This finding is inconsistent with the previous experimental study, which found that IV administration of BNT162b2 induces myocarditis more significantly than IM administration (Li et al. 2022). Importantly, when LNPs are injected into the bloodstream, they interact with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is highly conserved in hepatocytes, leading to rapid absorption and degradation of LNPs in the liver (Pardi et al. 2015;Yan et al. 2005). Consequently, mRNA-LNP agents degrade more rapidly when injected intravenously compared to intramuscularly (Pardi et al. 2015). Exceptionally, the ApoE-mediated absorption and degradation of LNPs can vary based on the LNP composition, and ApoEindependent pathways have also been identified (Gregersen et al. 2024;Paunovska et al. 2022;Sebastiani et al. 2021). LNPs are delivered to various tissues from the injection site via not only blood vessels but also lymphatic vessels (McCright et al. 2022;Rip et al. 2005). Lymphatic vessels, well-conserved in skeletal muscle and heart, play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis (Henri et al. 2016;Kivel\u00e4 et al. 2007;Klotz et al. 2015). Therefore, we hypothesize that when the mRNA vaccines, composed of LNPs susceptible to ApoE-mediated degradation administered via the IM route, the mRNA vaccines might remain in the body than the IV route and affect heart tissue more via lymphatic vessels than blood vessels. This hypothesis needs clarification through follow-up studies.",

Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-decorated NP surfaces were engineered to anchor Apo-E. Then PLGA-PEG 2000 -DHA (PPD) NPs have an Apo-E-enriched corona prolonging the NPs blood circulation thereby facilitating their accumulation in tumor cells by the passive enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. On observing the anti-tumor activity on 4T1 tumor harboring Balb/c mice, it proved a delayed tumor growth performance and triggered signi\ue103cant tumor cell apoptosis with no change in body weight, organ index or haematological parameters. Similarly, in situ albuminenriched corona was explored by the same group. 95 Maleimidecoated NPs were prepared that preferentially bind endogenous albumin in the corona allowing NPs to stealth and tumor homing ability. These in situ approaches have improved delivering efficient chemotherapy with minimum off target toxicities.\n\nRemarkably, for iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) coated with glucose or PEG, it was observed 96 that both surface coatings adsorbed a similar number of proteins in vitro but there was a clear difference in the PC composition which was correlated to the NP biodistribution in vivo. This results in slower degradation of the glucose coating in vitro than in vivo where an accelerated biodegradation and clearance were observed for PEG coating in both liver and spleen. The reason for faster in vivo degradation lies in the composition of the PC. Glucosefunctionalized IONPs had opsonins while PEG was enriched with albumin that degrades faster PEG is known to inhibit the formation of PC. However, it further raised a concern over using PEG for prolonged circulation time due to the \ue103nding of anti-PEG antibodies. 97 As analyzed in vivo by Grenier et al. 98 on PEGylated liposomes and polymeric NPs, using anti-PEG antibodies can have a signi\ue103cant neutralizing effect. Comparing the corona formed in naive mice, the exact impact of these antibodies on PC was found. The changes were",

            "text": ", functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264]. Despite these difficulties, there are promising examples which have already demonstrated efficient, cell-or tissue-specific delivery of nucleic acids. Additionally, scientists have started to exploit the protein corona to tune particle distribution in vivo. It is commonly known that plasma proteins adsorption depends on particle surface characteristics. Hence, slight structural changes of the particle surface have shown to affect the protein corona composition. As a consequence of protein corona modification, transport to target cells by coating with certain plasma proteins which serve as endogenous ligands can be obtained in vivo. For example, DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes have shown to adsorb vitronectin which mediated receptor-dependent uptake by tumor cells expressing \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrins [265]. Patisiran is another prominent example for targeted transport to hepatocytes, mediated by coating with endogenous ApoE [104,137]. Manipulation of the interaction with receptors in vivo and therefore targeted delivery to other cell types could be achieved by an altered protein corona as a consequence of exchanging certain lipid components of the Patisiran formulation [146]. Additionally, Saunders et al. used \"nanoprimers\" administered shortly before injection of therapeutic LNPs that were taken up by cells of the hepatic RES (Fig. 6B). By inhibiting KCs and LSECs, LNPs could be preferentially delivered to hepatocytes, the desired target site [266].\n\nBased on these observations, methods which enable fast screening of broad libraries of nucleic acid carriers in vivo were developed [106][107][108][109]. By means of that, evaluation and characterization of predominant plasma proteins in the corona and tuning the biodistribution profile based on facile structural variations becomes feasible, pathing the way for improved targeted, cell-specific nucleic acid delivery in vivo (see Fig. 6C) [110,[142][143][144][145].  5 Interaction of i",

Electron microscopic observations revealed that most of the LNPs were located in the space of Disse even at early time point (3 min after administration). Both rapid blood clearance and the accumulation of the bare LNPs which were absent in ApoE-deficient mice, were restored by the co-administration of recombinant ApoE protein. On the other hand, the GalNAc/Shielded LNPs gradually accumulated in liver tissue and were endocytosed by hepatocytes in wild-type mice. The ApoE is known to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as well as LDLR through the arginine-rich receptor-binding domain [48]. Treatment with heparin, which can compete with HSPGs, even 10 min after administration of the bare LNPs significantly suppressed both the accumulation and gene silencing of the LNPs in hepatocytes, suggesting that HSPGs in the liver are involved in the rapid accumulation of the bare LNPs. The relatively slow uptake of the bare or GalNAc/Shielded LNPs could be explained by assuming that receptors are mainly distributed on microvilli but not on coated pits and therefore a certain time would be required for the particles to migrate to coated pits for internalization [49,50].",

Numerous studies aimed at characterizing the transport of A\u03b2 through the membrane identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, 1B, 2, and 8 (LRP1, 1B, 2, and 8) as major players in AD (59)(60)(61)(62). The aforementioned LRPs interact with a wide range of ligands, including A\u03b2, the nontoxic precursor APP, and apolipoprotein E (also known as apoE) (63,64). By interacting with precursor APP, different LRPs play opposing roles in its endocytosis. Whereas, LRP1B retains APP at the cell surface and reduces A\u03b2 peptide production, LRP1 promotes fast endocytosis that results in an increase of APP processing into A\u03b2 (65). Binding of lipidcarrying apoE to LRP8 was shown to recruit the adapter protein A\u03b2 A4 precursor protein-binding family A member 1 (APBA1) and APP, thereby inducing the endocytosis of APP in neuroblastoma cells and leading to increased production of A\u03b2 (Fig. 1) (60). ApoE also plays a central role in AD by directly binding to A\u03b2. Initially, apoE was shown to bind A\u03b2 and to promote fibrillization of A\u03b2, particularly isoform 4, which is a major genetic risk factor for AD (66,67). However, searches for A\u03b2-binding proteins by affinity chromatography by Calero et al. led to the identification of serum amyloid P component (SAP) and apolipoprotein J (also known as clusterin) as the main plasma interactors of A\u03b2, while apoE was only marginally enriched (68). Subsequent work confirmed that only a small amount of apoE was bound to A\u03b2 in physiological conditions but that does not preclude the importance of this interaction (69). In fact, apoE has a role in A\u03b2 clearance.",

These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

In a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout model (LDLR\u2212/\u2212), LNP-siRNA formulations displayed less gene-silencing activity (leading to higher ED 50 values) than in wild-type animals. LNP activity could be rescued through addition of a multivalent targeting ligand, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), for the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor, thereby promoting internalization through an alternative endocytic route. 202,203 Authors concluded that ApoE association with siRNA-LNP systems plays a major role in triggering LNP uptake into hepatocytes by clathrinmediated endocytosis via the LDL receptor. These observations are in line with a previous study by Gilleron et al. reporting that uptake of LNPs in vitro occurs via macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 204 In this study, 50% reduction of LNP uptake upon downregulation of the clathrin heavy chain-1 was observed and knockdown of the macropinocytosis regulators CTBP1, Rac1, Rabankyrin-5 (but not Cdc42) or the use of EIPA, a pharmacological inhibitor of macropinocytosis, led to a 60% and 70% decrease in LNP uptake in HeLa cells, respectively. Downregulation of caveolin 1 did not modify LNP uptake. In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation",

            "text": ", and have been shown to exhibit intracellular A\u03b2 immunoreactivity in histological studies (12)(13)(14)(15). Cell-based assays have shown that cultured astrocytes take up and degrade soluble A\u03b2 and enhance the clearance of fibrillar A\u03b2 from ex vivo brain slices (16)(17)(18)(19). However, the receptors mediating A\u03b2 uptake into astrocytes are currently unknown.\n\nAn isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE4) is currently the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD. ApoE is a ligand that facilitates the receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles into cells (20). ApoE is hypothesized to play a central role in AD pathogenesis in large part through the regulation of A\u03b2 deposition and clearance (21,22). Murine studies have shown that the amount of apoE in the brain dramatically affects the extent of A\u03b2 deposition, as deletion of apoE in APP transgenic mouse models significantly decreased brain amyloid levels (23,24). Therefore, targeting proteins in the brain that modulate apoE levels represent an attractive pathway for decreasing amyloid deposition. The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family of receptors is a group of proteins sharing similar structural characteristics that exhibit various important endocytic and signaling functions. Members of this family include LDLR, lipoprotein receptor related-protein 1 (LRP1), very-low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and megalin (LRP2) (25). LDLR plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism in the periphery through facilitating the removal of cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles from the circulation (26). The uptake of lipoprotein particles occurs through the binding of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) or apolipoprotein E (apoE) to LDLR and subsequent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the central nervous system, the function of LDLR is less wellcharacterized. Recently, we have shown that increasing LDLR levels",

Up to 75 % of the plasma APOE is synthesized by liver parenchymal cells [16]; however, other organs and tissues produce significant amounts of APOE, most notably the brain, but also spleen, kidneys, macrophages and adipocytes [17][18][19]. In its primary role as an apolipoprotein, APOE maintains the structural integrity of lipoproteins and facilitates their solubilization in the blood [20]. APOE is fundamentally involved in the lipid homeostasis of hepatic and non-hepatic tissues. Both the exogenous and the endogenous pathway of lipoprotein metabolism depend on APOE. Chylomicrons, synthesized and secreted by the intestine to transport dietary lipids to the liver and adipose tissues, acquire APOE in the circulation. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles secreted by the liver comprise APOE and transport endogenously synthesized triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to peripheral tissues [19]. As a high-affinity ligand for receptors of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, APOE facilitates the internalization of lipids into hepatic and extrahepatic cells [21]. Moreover, APOE produced by macrophages plays a pivotal role in the so-called reverse cholesterol transport, where excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues is redirected via APOE-containing high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles to the liver for elimination [22,23]. By these functions, APOE is fundamentally involved in the lipid and cholesterol homeostasis.

In addition, by analyzing the protein crown components on the surface of liver-targeting and lung-targeting LNPs, the scientists identified 14 proteins that may influence the lung targeting of LNPs, including albumin, ApoE, fibrinogen \u03b2, and fibrinogen \u03b3. It remains to be further investigated which protein or proteins play the decisive role. In addition, changes in lipid species or alternative approaches such as LNPs that contain bound phospholipids [136] and engineered LNPs [137] can also alter the targeting of LNPs. \n\nIn the future, achieving targeted delivery of mRNA will become more challenging and critical, which may accelerate the widespread use of mRNA technology in precision medicine. The combination of tissue-and cell-targeting strategies may be a good method, but there are still some issues to be addressed. For example, ligand/antibody-modified LNPs may disrupt the balance of internal components and the recruitment of protein crowns in the blood, thus affecting the established tissue specificity of the LNPs. We believe that with further research on targeted delivery, more-precise targeting strategies will emerge and be applied in precision medicine in the future.",

This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a 34 kDa glycoprotein (299 amino acids) encoded by the $3.6 kb gene on chromosome 19, APOE. The primary physiological role of ApoE is in lipoprotein homeostasis, though is implicated in multiple diverse roles in both the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery (Mahley, 1988;Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020). In the CNS, ApoE is the primary apolipoprotein with expression predominantly driven by astrocytes (Boyles et al., 1985;Grehan et al., 2001;Pitas et al., 1987) and also within microglia (Nakai et al., 1996;Xu et al., 1999), the neurovasculature (Majacek et al., 1988) and neurons under conditions of stress (Xu et al., 1996). Typically, ApoE is secreted from astrocytes and lipidated via members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cassette binding transporter (ABC) family, such as ABCA1. ApoE mediates the transport of cholesterol and various lipids in lipoprotein complexes to neurons for internalisation by interacting with ApoE receptors (ApoER2/LRP8), members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein (LRP) families as well as heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Bu, 2009;DeMattos et al., 2001;Hirota et al., 2015;Mahley et al., 2009;Strasser et al., 2004). \n\nAPOE exists as three common allelic isoforms: APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 (encoding proteins ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4), which arise from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring single amino acid substitutions.",

Numerous research articles have accumulated solid evidence that lipoproteins are closely related to various types of tumorigenesis. In this review, we focused on the associations between several apolipoproteins and breast carcinoma and distinguished the effects and significance of apolipoproteins in different locations to validate their roles in breast carcinoma development. For example, apoD and apoE in serum are viewed as risk factors for breast carcinoma. ApoD, apoE and apoA-I in mammary tissues inhibit tumor growth. Moreover, apoB, apoJ and apoA-I have the potential to function as diagnostic or prognostic markers in the clinic. ApoEdp and apoJ treatment on breast carcinoma could significantly restrict tumor growth. In general, the aim of this review was to further analyze the associations between some members of the apolipoprotein family and breast cancer.",

            "text": "ApoC1, the smallest protein of all known apolipoproteins, 6.7 kDa, with a normal plasma concentration of 0.04-0.07 mg/mL, is one of the most positively charged proteins of the human body (pI 8.3) [75]. It is associated with both HDL (high-density lipoproteins) and VLDL. It is possible that ApoC1 contributes most to the shielding of SiaLe X ligand from specific interactions with E-selectin on activated endothelial cells, which we observed in the human serum flow in a microfluidic device. Liposomes are characterized by lower content of ApoE compared to blank plasma, which indicates VLDLs are more likely contaminants of liposome-protein complexes isolated by SEC rather than particles interacting with the liposomes. Notably, according to the LFQ intensities data, liposome protein coronas were enriched with apolipoprotein M, a component of HDLs. Some of the protein constituents of HDLs were enriched only in selected liposomal samples, particularly apolipoprotein C1 and serum amyloid A4 (SAA4) protein on 5SX and 10SX and apolipoprotein C4 on 10SX. These data suggest that HDL components are selectively adsorbed on liposome surfaces. SAA4, constitutively expressed in the liver and secreted into plasma (~0.055 mg/mL) as part of HDLs, serves as a precursor to the fibrillar tissue protein AA. The content of SAA4 increases rapidly in the acute phase of inflammation in patients with venous thrombosis [76]. By taking into account the connection of selectin expression with inflammatory processes, it can be assumed that their ligand-SiaLe X -is somehow indirectly involved in interaction with apolipoprotein SAA4. \n\nLiterature data on the protein corona proteome of anionic liposomes are scarce. An early work by Caracciolo and co-authors suggests lower content of total apolipoproteins (below 20%) and immunoglobulins (below 15%) for 100% POPG liposomes [77].",

SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al. 2021). Different from endogenous targeting via serum proteins, numerous ligands were utilized to functionalize LNPs to achieve targeted nucleic acid delivery through active targeting. In this section, we summarize the currently reachable organs and cell types by ligand-modified nucleic acid-LNPs (supplementary Table S2).",

            "text": "However, the relative abundant of ApoE, HSA and VTN on PEG-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are much lower and they are not the most preferred corona proteins on PEG-Fe 3 O 4 , so the conformational changes are less compared to the magnetosome. \n\nThe effect of protein corona formation on the cellular uptake of nanoparticles has been addressed in detail in numerous studies which suggest that the presence of the corona does indeed alter the cellular response through enhancing or decreasing cellular uptake. 20,23,37,47,58,72 Hence it is also need to exploit the effect of the magnetosomes corona on cell. All of these findings help us to understand the physiological response to magnetosomes. Combining an interaction database filter and GO annotation, we noticed that magnetosome's abundant corona components had numerous cell membrane or extracellular matrix binding targets (Figure 5). Among these proteins, ApoE, as the most abundant corona protein, is recognized by the LDL receptor family and functions as one of the major determinants in lipid transport, and plays a critical role in atherosclerosis and other diseases. 61 LDL receptors are widely expressed in vascular endothelial cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, arterial wall smooth muscle cells, liver, and adrenal cortical cells, and participate in receptor-mediated membrane endocytosis (clathrin-mediated). 42 This most likely indicates that the corona, when in the presence of ApoE, may affect the magnetosome uptake process in these cells. Thus, we examined the effect of the plasma corona on the interaction with human vascular endothelial cells that express the LDL receptor. As a result, the corona significantly increased the interaction between the magnetosome-protein complexes and cells compared to the interaction seen with pristine magnetosomes (Figure 6, Figure S6). Moreover, cell reduced the magnetosome-protein complexes uptake when LDL receptor was knockdown (Figure S7). Confocal imaging also showed that pristine magnetosomes do not bind to the LDL receptor when being internalized.",

To avoid non-specific tissue uptake of LNP during circulation, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids were usually modified on the surface of LNP complex. The PEG lipids will gradually dissociate during blood circulation, i.e., shedding from the LNP, which mitigate its negative effects to the interaction between LNP and membrane of targeting cells 57 . In the liver targeted LNP-based drug, like Patisiran (the first siRNA-loaded LNP therapeutic being approved by FDA in 2018) 58 , the removal of PEG lipid enhanced LNP absorption on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). LNPs accumulated in the liver along the blood circulation are taken up by hepatocytes, which are mediated by ApoE receptors on the hepatocytes surface. After its endocytosis by targeting cells, the pH changes in vesicles leads to the release of nucleotides 59 . \n\nBased on this mechanism, some lncRNAs targeting siRNA delivered by LNP were also developed since the clinical success of Patisiran. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Connorty et al. 60 identified lncRNA LINC01257 as having an oncogenic role by promoting the proliferation of leukemia. By mixing siRNA with a lipid mixture (D-Lin-MC3, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG, DOPE-Rho), they targeted LINC01257 in AML cells by NxGen microfluidics systems (Fig. 6). The si-LINC01257-LNP effectively inhibits the proliferation of AML cells and reduces the off-target effects to the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

[17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.",

            "text": "The knowledge gap in the interplay between liposomes and the physiological environment, for example, the blood and interstitial fluids, is probably one of the major reasons responsible for the limited clinical use of liposome-based therapeutics. Most of the commercially available liposomal products are administered systemically. Once administered, liposomes are immediately surrounded by various plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, immunoglobin, apolipoprotein, and fibrinogen), forming the socalled \"protein coronas\" as shown in Figure 1. [12,13] The protein coronas usually consist of two layers, the inner layer (hard corona) formed by proteins tightly bound to the liposome and the outer layer (soft corona) composed of loosely bound proteins. The boundary between the two layers is blurred and the corona is always in a thermodynamic equilibrium during blood circulation. \n\nThere are dozens of plasma proteins with varying identities and quantities, and the composition of protein coronas can be greatly influenced by the complexity of the physiological environment. As a result, the impact of protein adsorption on liposomes can be multifold. It might mask the pre-set chemical or biological functions of liposomes and govern the in vivo fate, including circulation lifetime, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and targeting ability. Even though the liposomes are surface-modified for certain chemical or biological functions, they can be easily masked by the corona. Moreover, the hydration layer around the liposomes is displaced upon protein binding, and the resulting protein aggregation and conformational changes may trigger immune responses in hosts. [11,14]",

This relationship was clearly demonstrated in a study by Dilliard et al., which showed that the protein corona formation, depending on the lipid composition, influenced the distribution of LNPs to different organs. [36] The Onpattro\u00ae formulation leverages this phenomenon by encouraging the development of an apolipoprotein (ApoE)rich corona, which notably enhances hepatocyte uptake via low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-Receptor) pathway following intravenous administration. [37] The influence of protein corona formation after incubation with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was explored by Subramaniam et al. They observed that the cellular uptake of liposomes within epithelial cells and macrophages varied depending on the surface chemistry and composition. An albumin-rich corona led to rapid endocytosis and exocytosis in macrophages, whereas the uptake within epithelial cells was not influenced by incubation with BAL fluid. [38] We hypothesize that by directly conjugating transferrin to LNPs, we can specifically tailor their uptake for T-cell transfection, thereby avoiding the necessity of protein corona formation for macrophage uptake. Motamedi et al. and our previous work demonstrated that the expression of TfR on the surface of CD4 + Th 2 cells is enhanced following activation with CD3/CD28 antibodies, a process similar to the activation of T-cells observed in asthma. [39,40]. \n\nTo enhance cellular uptake into Th 2 -cells, we hijacked the TfR pathway. The TfR is wellknown to undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis upon binding with transferrin, facilitating iron uptake into cells physiologically. Subsequent to internalization, TfR is typically recycled back to the cell surface avoiding trafficking to the late endosome or lysosome. [41] Given that LNPs are recognized to escape from endosomes before and after reaching the late stages of endosomal maturation, this pathway proves advantageous for active targeting.",

For example, quaternium lipids, 1, 2-Dioleoyl-3trimethylam-monium propane (DOTAP), with an increase in the molar percentage of DOTAP, promote the expression of luciferase proteins gradually from the liver (mDLNPs, 0% DOTAP) to the spleen (10-15% DOTAP) and then to the lungs (50% DOTAP). 25 However, differences in the biological distribution of different formulations, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure and activity, remain to be fully understood. 122 Targeting strategies designed using formulation optimization are often preferentially taken up by certain organs but rarely achieve high levels of target cell-specific expression. 48 The representative chemical structures of key lipids or SORT molecules in LNPs, designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery, are illustrated in Figure 6.

The fabricated nanoparticles in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) formed a unique protein corona consisting mainly of transport proteins, such as albumin (ALB) protein, serum albumin, serotransferrin, \u03b1-fetoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein, uncharacterized protein, apolipoprotein A-II, hemoglobin fetal subunit beta, globin A1, hemoglobin subunit beta, hemoglobin beta, and globin C1, while lacking common opsonins (Tables 6 and 7). \n\nFigure 10 and Tables 8-10 show the distribution of proteins in the corona where transport proteins made up the largest segment of the protein corona with 60%, 73.33%, and 68.75% for CA, CMCA, and \u03b1-KAMCA NPs, respectively, including albumin proteins, which are the most abundant proteins in plasma (also known as dysopsonins that inhibit opsonization), followed by immunoglobulins and coagulation proteins responsible for the alteration of NP opsonization, allocation, and targeting efficiency [50][51][52]. The constituents of the protein corona, shown in the abovementioned figure and tables, display an abundance of transport proteins, including several albumin proteins, but a lack of immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, globulins, complement proteins, and fibrinogen. CA, CMCA, and \u03b1-KAMCA NPs were found to bind acute-phase proteins at almost 13.33%, 13.33%, and 12.5%, respectively, which may contribute to opsonization. This finding was further supported by the distribution of NP-encapsulated DOX in the tissues enriched with RES such as the liver, lungs, and spleen (Table 3).",

            "text": "This study shows that elevated apolipoprotein E in PDAC mediates immune suppression and high serum apolipoprotein E levels correlate with poor patient survival. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with few effective therapeutic options. PDAC is characterized by an extensive fibroinflammatory stroma that includes abundant infiltrating immune cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are prevalent within the stroma and are key drivers of immunosuppression. TAMs in human and murine PDAC are characterized by elevated expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), an apolipoprotein that mediates cholesterol metabolism and has known roles in cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease but no known role in PDAC. We report here that ApoE is also elevated in peripheral blood monocytes in PDAC patients, and plasma ApoE protein levels stratify patient survival. Orthotopic implantation of mouse PDAC cells into syngeneic wild-type or in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced tumor growth in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice. Histologic and mass cytometric (CyTOF) analysis of these tumors showed an increase in CD8+ T cells in tumors in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice. Mechanistically, ApoE induced pancreatic tumor cell expression of Cxcl1 and Cxcl5, known immunosuppressive factors, through LDL receptor and NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, this study reveals a novel immunosuppressive role of ApoE in the PDAC microenvironment. Significance: This study shows that elevated apolipoprotein E in PDAC mediates immune suppression and high serum apolipoprotein E levels correlate with poor patient survival.

            "text": "To assess fibronectin's impact on EV-mediated functional RNA delivery and uptake, we confirmed its presence on the EV surface. Additionally, blocking fibronectin on EVs significantly reduced both functional RNA delivery and uptake. Interestingly, fibronectin is not a membrane-bound protein; it is, however, loosely bound to EVs via its interaction to HSPGs. This signifies the importance of EVs' protein corona and its potential role in EV uptake and functional cargo delivery. It has been reported that the composition of the protein corona on EVs can influence their in vivo kinetics and could contribute to biological effects (23). As the protein corona can directly influence cellular uptake and organ biodistribution, it is crucial to thoroughly study EVs' protein corona and its impact on cargo delivery and organ tropism. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that fibronectin is more associated with \"dense EVs\", i.e. EVs with higher density (1.145 g/ml) from the 100K pellet (24). This suggests that different EV populations can have varying uptake properties and effects on recipient cells, which may, to some extent, be dependent on the protein corona, and could explain why we consistently observed only partial inhibition of EV uptake and cargo delivery when blocking the fibronectin/ ITGB1 axis. Interestingly, it has also been shown that targeted drug delivery using synthetic lipid nanoparticles is affected by their specific corona proteins (25), highlighting the significance of protein corona in uptake and tropism of nanoparticles more generally. \n\nFinally, we show that the fibronectin on the surface of EVs interacts with integrins on the recipient cell surfaces via the LDV binding site, while also being potentially tethered to HSPGs on EVs. Alternatively, fibronectin could be bound onto the EV phospholipid membrane directly (26). Disruption of these binding sites resulted in a significant reduction in both EV uptake and functional RNA delivery. Other integrin binding sites on fibronectin are available (Fig. 5A), with the most common site being the arginine-glycine-aspartate motif.",

In principle, the LNP delivery mechanism is similar for siRNA [38e40] and mRNA [10,11,41]. The three main steps are as follows (Fig. 2). First, full encapsulation by LNP protects RNA from nuclease digestion. LNPs are neutral in physiological pH due to the ionizable lipid and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid, thereby reducing non-specific interactions with serum proteins. Second, following dissociation of the PEG-lipid, cells take up LNPs via apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-dependent and/or ApoE-independent pathways. Finally, protonated LNPs, upon acidification in the endosome, induce hexagonal phase structures, disrupt the membranes, and release RNA molecules into the cytoplasm. The released RNA molecules lead to either down regulation (siRNA) or up regulation (mRNA) of target proteins. Details regarding the uptake of LNPs into hepatocytes have already been reported, revealing that LNPs are internalized via LDL receptors following the ApoE-dependent pathway [38]. Details regarding the uptake into antigen-presenting cells have not yet been clarified; however, efficient localization of nucleic acids in the cytoplasm of antigen presenting cells has been reported [42].",

Recently, we demonstrated that LRP5 is also required for normal cholesterol metabolism and glucose-induced insulin secretion. To further define the role of LRP5 in the lipoprotein metabolism, we compared plasma lipoproteins in mice lacking LRP5, apolipoprotein E (apoE), or both (apoE;LRP5 double knockout). On a normal chow diet, the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice (older than 4 months of age) had \u223c60% higher plasma cholesterol levels compared with the age-matched apoE knockout mice. In contrast, LRP5 deficiency alone had no significant effects on the plasma cholesterol levels. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma lipoproteins revealed that cholesterol levels in the very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein fractions were markedly increased in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. There were no apparent differences in the pattern of apoproteins between the apoE knockout mice and the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. The plasma clearance of intragastrically loaded triglyceride was markedly impaired by LRP5 deficiency. The atherosclerotic lesions of the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice aged 6 months were \u223c3-fold greater than those in the age-matched apoE-knockout mice. Furthermore, histological examination revealed highly advanced arthrosclerosis, with remarkable accumulation of foam cells and destruction of the internal elastic lamina in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. These data suggest that LRP5 mediates both apoE-dependent and apoE-independent catabolism of plasma lipoproteins.",

This review will summarize the updated research progress on APOE functions and its role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cardiovascular diseases, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Type III hyperlipoproteinemia, vascular dementia, and ischemic stroke. Understanding the mutations in APOE, their structural properties, and their isoforms is important to determine its role in various diseases and to advance the development of therapeutic strategies. Targeting APOE may be a potential approach for diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, and treatment of various neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases in humans.",

            "text": "Another critical effect affecting biodistribution is protein corona, which coats particles with serum proteins [55]. Because of the nanoparticle coating, slight alterations in surface charges are expected, leading to further interactions between serum proteins in a cascade fashion and thus preventing the interaction between nanomedicines and their tumor targets [56]. However, it is essential to emphasize that the protein corona effect involves two classes of components affecting nanomedicines' biodistribution: opsonins and dysopsonins [57]. Opsonins, such as proteins of the complement system (C3b and C1q) and immunoglobulins, are the most common, and their adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles is responsible for their engulfment and clearance by the RES-associated phagocytic cells, more specifically in the liver and spleen [58][59][60][61][62][63]. Engrafting hydrophilic or amphiphilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), on the surface of the particles, is one strategy for reducing RES recognition [60,64,65]. Despite the popularity of this technique, issues related to PEG molecules' stability and immunogenicity have emerged in the last few years [66,67]. Recently, zwitterionic materials, such as sulfobetaine, have been used to confer stealth properties. Their mixed charges and electrostatic repulsion account for dense packing, thus impairing protein corona formation [68][69][70][71]. In contrast, dysopsonins, such as clusterin (apolipoprotein J) and albumin, have the opposite effect, prolonging nanomedicine's half-life in circulation [64,72]. For example, the glycoprotein CD47, which is expressed in all cellular membranes of humans, mice, and other mammals [73], interacts with CD172a on phagocytes [74] and inhibits macrophage uptake of antibody-coated mouse red blood cells (RBCs) [75].",

In contrast, only one immune response protein was among the 32 proteins more abundant on Ana-PEG than Ana. Consistent with its role as an early response antibody, 47 immunoglobulin M (IgM) was the most prevalent member of this group, accounting for 15% of the Ana corona (1st overall) and 4% of the Ana-PEG corona (8th overall).

LNP-siRNA systems with different LNP diameters were produced (27 to 117 nm) and the silencing efficiency of FVII was analyzed. An LNP size of around 80 nm exhibited the most efficient gene silencing in the liver; therefore, we prepared LNPs with a size of around 80 nm. \n\nIn LNP-Cre-treated mice, deletion of the floxed allele occurred in tissues other than the liver; however, the recombination-mediated deletion rate in these non-target tissues was less than 7% when the mice were dosed at 0.05 mg/kg body weight. A previous study demonstrated that apolipoprotein E plays an important role in the hepatocellular uptake of LNP via the low-density lipoprotein receptor, and hepatocellular uptake was significantly decreased in apolipoprotein E knockout mice [6,7]. Thus, the binding of apolipoprotein E to the surface of LNPs followed by uptake via an LDL receptor is the major uptake mechanism for this particle. This receptor is expressed mainly in the liver, but it is also expressed in the lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, WAT, and testis, which explains why flox recombination occurred in these tissues. \n\nSince mRNA does not have the ability to self-replicate, its expression is inevitably transient. Nevertheless, LNP-Cre-mediated recombination occurred to the same extent as in AlbCre +/wt Tet3 flox/flox and AlbCre +/wt Meg3 flox/flox mice after a single dose of LNP-Cre. Hence, we consider the method of producing liver-specific knockout mouse by administering LNPs to be very useful.",

            "text": "In recent years, research on the protein corona of NPs has focused on reducing the toxicity of NPs with a pre-existing protein layer [95], avoiding the immune system through surface modifications of NPs [96], and exploring ways to concentrate key proteins within the corona that may favor association with particular cell/tissue types, such as using a peptide to enrich coronas with apolipoproteins [97]. Our work addresses these same aims by using the unique biophysical properties of HBPE to selectively absorb and enrich proteins from IAV infection-derived sera and form a non-toxic protein corona that enhances the interaction of NPs with multiple cancer cell receptors while reducing the uptake by monocytes. Coronal proteins identified herein from VS5 could be adapted for functionalizing the surface of NPs or conjugated to cancer drugs to directly target tumors or indirectly to target cancerbinding proteins. For instance, physiochemical modifications to NPs for integrin-and hyaluronan-binding are a focus of study for cancer targeting nanomaterials [98,99]. Our use of sera from the IAV infection as a novel source of coronal proteins to modulate the biological identity of HBPE-NPs shows that the drug delivery efficiency of NPs can be optimized by taking advantage of the inherent properties of an activated immune system (source of shed proteins) and the biophysical properties of nanomaterials that control the absorption of proteins encountered during circulation.",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein E is synthesized by hepatic cells and a large number of extrahepatic cell types (1,2). In the liver, apoE is produced as a surface constituent of lipoprotein particles and serves as a ligand for several cell membrane endocytic receptors found in liver and peripheral cells. In addition, apoE is a highly charged protein and has strong affinity for negatively charged proteoglycans, including those found on the cell surface. Consistent with this, apoE has been detected in a cell surface pool in hepatic cells and macrophages, where it may be involved in modulating cellular lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). \n\nThe function of apoE synthesized in multiple extrahepatic cell types remains incompletely defined. In macrophages, the regulation of apoE gene expression and apoE secretion by small increments in cellular cholesterol mass led to the hypothesis that apoE could serve a role in macrophage cholesterol homeostasis, as part of a regulatory loop to reduce cellular free cholesterol content (8). Subsequent studies confirmed such a role and indicated that expression of apoE in macrophages functions to enhance cholesterol efflux and reduce macrophage cholesterol stores in the presence and absence of extracellular acceptor particles (9,10). Studies using genetically engineered mice and bone marrow transplantation technology have confirmed an important role for macrophage-derived apoE in modulating susceptibility to atherosclerosis (11)(12)(13)(14). Mice with a specific defect in macrophage apoE expression displayed a 10fold increase in susceptibility to atherosclerosis while on a high fat diet (14). Conversely, macrophage-specific expression of apoE has been shown to protect mice from the effect of atherogenic hyperlipidemia (13). There are multiple properties of apoE which can be considered in evaluating the mechanism of such a protective effect (1,2).",

Li et al. recently designed LNPs targeted to plasmalemma vehicle-associated protein (PV1), known to be associated with lung endothelial caveolae, through conjugation of DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (DSPC:Chol:DMG-PEG:DSPE-PEG maleimide, 50:10:38:1.75:0.25) to a Fab-C4 caveolae-targeting nanobody, and demonstrated significantly higher targeting specificity of PV1-targeted LNPs to mouse lungs compared to the control LNPs after i.v. administration [ 208 ]. Interestingly, increasing LNP size from 70 to 160 nm in this study further directed LNPs out of the lymphatics towards the lungs. The fluidic nature of the LNPs is advantageous, here: nanoparticle elasticity has been shown to be crucial for effective PV1-targeting when vehicle size is over 100 nm [ 209 ]. Modulation of the mRNA:lipid ratio also impacted localization of the LNPs: a mRNA:lipid (N/P) ratio of 3 trafficked predominantly to lungs, whereas a mRNA:lipid (N/P) ratio of 10 localized similarly between the lungs and the spleen, likely consistent with a higher proportion of cationic lipid in a given formulation mix (i.e., at a mRNA:lipid ratio of 3) appearing to favor lung targeting and expression.",

The protein corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' blood circulation, clearance, biodistribution, biodegradation, and delivery efficiency. For instance, opsonin's enhances the phagocytosis and removal of nanoparticles from circulation, whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins can extend their circulation time. However, the protein corona can mask nanoparticle targeting groups, such as transferrin, reducing their delivery efficiency to tumours. Nanoparticles need to be small enough, typically less than 4 \u00b5m, for effective cellular uptake, with those under 100 nm being absorbed more efficiently through endocytosis. Drug carriers between 100-1000 nm have higher bioavailability once endocytosed, with nanoparticles around 50 nm showing the highest cellular uptake. 51 The surface charge of nanoparticles also plays a crucial role, as cationic and neutral particles exhibit higher transport efficiency due to electrostatic attraction than negatively charged particles. Uptake mechanisms include clathrinmediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and physical adhesion followed by penetration, while larger particles involve energy-dependent endocytosis. Additionally, physicochemical surface coatings, such as chitosan, can optimize paracellular transport for drug delivery.",

This was established by observing diminished LNP transfection efficiency in both apoE -/-and LDLR -/-mice [27]. To determine if this mechanism plays a role in LNP uptake in the RPE, the FDA approved LNPs (MC3, DSPC, DMG-PEG2k, and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 50:10:1.5:38.5) containing luciferase mRNA were subretinally injected into apoE -/- mice (Fig 4A and 4B). Luciferase expression was evident in apoE -/-mouse eyes at 24 hours post-injection and was not significantly different from expression measured in C57BL6 control animals (Fig 4A and 4B, p>0.05). These data suggested that apoE is not functioning as an endogenous targeting ligand for LNP uptake in the RPE. Once a day, RPE cells phagocytose and digest the shedding rod and cone photoreceptor outer segment tips making RPE cells the most actively phagocytic cells in the body [28]. We hypothesized that if phagocytosis was blocked, LNP entry in the RPE would diminish. LNPs containing mCherry mRNA were subretinally injected in Mertk -/-mice, in which the main receptor responsible for phagocytosis is dysfunctional and leads to the accumulation of shed photoreceptor outer segments in the subretinal space [29].",

            "text": "A galectin 8 (Gal8) recruitment assay was used to evaluate the level of endosomal disruption by the LNPs. Gal8 is a cytoplasmic protein that can selectively bind with glycosylated moieties in the internal endosome membrane. [38] Cells stably expressing Gal8-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein have been widely used to evaluate endosomal escape. If the endosome is disrupted, the cytoplasmic Gal8-YFP can be recruited to damaged endosomes, forming discrete yellow fluorescent spots, [39] as depicted in Figure 2f. As shown in Figure 2g, LNPs with a higher DOTMA content resulted in fewer yellow fluorescent spots, while those with a higher proportion of ionizable lipid MC3 generated much more yellow spots in the treated cells (Figure 2h), suggesting that ionizable lipid MC3 in the LNPs can promote endosomal escape of the LNPs after endocytosis. According to the above results, we chose the LNP formulation prepared at 20:20:20 (simplified as LNP in later studies) as the lead LNP carrier in further studies. \n\nAnother key challenge for nanocarriers in protein delivery especially for in vivo applications is their serum stability. Nanoparticles such as LNPs were adsorbed with serum proteins, and the proteins abundant in the blood may trigger the release of cargo proteins and affect the endocytosis as well as intracellular trafficking of the nanoparticles. [40,41] Therefore, we investigated the influence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the delivery efficacy of prepared LNPs. As shown in Figure 3a, FBS addition greatly enhanced the GFP delivery efficacy of the LNPs on 143B cells. The presence of FBS did not result in the pre-release of encapsulted GFP in the LNPs (Figure 3b). We further examined how serum proteins facilitate GFP delivery into the cells. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking.",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

However, the formation of the protein corona can shield these targeting moieties and cause mistargeting and unfavourable biodistribution 20 . \n\nThere are four major proposed strategies to address the shielding role of the protein corona on targeted NPs (Fig. 2). \n\nProtein-repellent coating. The first strategy involves the use of protein-repellent coatings (such as zwitterionic compounds) on the surface of NPs to prevent and/or minimize corona formation 100,101 (Fig. 2a). For example, silica NPs functionalized with cysteine (as a zwitterionic ligand) and conjugated with biotin (as a targeting molecule) prevented the formation of the protein corona, when compared with the same NP without cysteine functionalization 101 . The zwitterionic coating also substantially improved the targeting capacity. Another relevant example is the use of antifouling polymers (such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylene oxide) 102 , which reduce shielding by the protein corona on the basis of the characteristics of the specific coating (such as density, size, length and heterogeneity of the polymeric coating) 103,104 . \n\nPre-coating strategy. Another strategy is to pre-coat NPs with components that recruit plasma proteins with targeting capacities during corona formation 29 (Fig. 2b). The pre-coating strategy, which was first used in 1980 to inhibit uptake of liposomes by macrophages 105 , can be precisely designed to manipulate protein corona composition in a way that provides a new impetus for targeted payload delivery to specific biosystems and/or tissues. For example, surface modification of liposomes with a short amyloid \u03b2-derived peptide can recruit plasma apolipoproteins, and the resulting apolipoprotein corona-coated liposomes can target brain tissue for high-yield drug delivery applications 106 .",

[108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

            "text": "To further develop a therapeutic approach, we tested whether LNP could be used to deliver the STING R284S mRNA into cancer cells. The LNP we exploited in this study has been shown to efficiently deliver genes in vivo [62]. However, we did not observe significant expression of STING WT and STING R284S in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells treated with the respective mRNA-LNP (Figures 5A and S3A, rows 2, 5). We reasoned that this could be due to a lack of human apolipoprotein E (APOE) in our in vitro cultures. In the in vivo setting, APOE plays an important role in the cellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins through binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors [63,64]. When mixed with mRNA-LNP before transduction, human APOE4 has been shown to radically increase mRNA-LNP transduction efficiency in vitro [63,64]. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA expression of the APOE4 receptor, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), was significantly up-regulated in PDAC tumors compared to normal pancreatic tissues [65], supporting the idea of using APOE4 to enhance the mRNA-LNP delivery efficiency. We therefore tested whether mixing STING WT or STING R284S mRNA-LNP with APOE4 could facilitate the delivery of mRNA into PDAC cells. We found that APOE4 robustly stimulates the delivery of mRNA-LNP into PDAC cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 5A and S3A). Compared to untreated cells, higher levels of STING WT and STING R284S mRNA were detected by RT-PCR in cells treated with a combination of mRNA-LNP and APOE4 (Figures 5B and S3B). The combined treatment of STING R284S mRNA-LNP and APOE4 also significantly augmented the expression of key anti-tumor cytokines, such as CCL5, CXCL10, IL29, IL6 and TNF\u03b1, as compared with treatment using STING WT mRNA (Figures 5C and S3C).",

            "text": "In recent years, nanocarriers have been employed for targeted drug delivery. Biomolecular corona formation is the first event nanocarriers experience upon entering into the bloodstream and coming into contact with its components. The rapidly forming corona consists of proteins, but also of sugars, lipids, and other components of the plasma.\n\nThe biomolecular corona formed on the surface of nanocarriers confers them a unique identity, which later determines their biological fate within the body, such as cellular uptake, biodistribution, retention, and clearance. 1,2 The clearance of nanocarriers from the body is usually carried out by scavenging the activity of immune system cells, such as macrophages. Thus, one of the strategies towards targeted drug delivery is to make nanocarriers \"invisible\" to the immune system, a phenomenon also known as the stealth effect. This will allow nanocarriers to circulate in the bloodstream for an extended period of time and to reach their target. 3 Studies demonstrated that surface functionalization of nanocarriers (e.g. attachment of polyethylene glycol or PEGylation), and the appearance of certain proteins in the corona result in an increased stealth effect. 4 Sch\u00f6ttler et al. showed that clusterin confers to the nanoparticles a strong stealth effect. 4 Clusterin (also known as apolipoprotein J) is a 70-80 kDa lipoprotein consisting of two polypeptide chains that are connected by up to 5 disulfide bonds. Seven asparagine residues of clusterin are highly glycosylated and the glycosylic groups add up to ca. 30% of the total protein weight 5 (UniProt Protein Database, Protein ID P10909).\n\nOther major examples of lipoproteins include high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very lowdensity lipoprotein (vLDL) complexes of the blood.

Furthermore, the expression of LDLr and LRP1r is highly expressed on cancer cells [23] . Herein, we hypothesized that the in situ immobilized apoErich corona might salvage PPD NPs from reticuloendothelial system (RES) elimination, and promote NPs distributing into tumor cells by LDLr-mediated active targeting transport, both of which contribute to the enhanced anticancer activity in vivo ( Fig. 1 ). \n\nTo validate this hypothesis, we synthesized the novel PPD conjugate by coupling DHA to terminal carboxyl of PLGA-PEG2000-COOH via a single ester bond linkage, and formulated PPD NPs via the emulsion solvent evaporation method. Then the next performances of apoE-recruited PPD NPs, such as pharmaceutical characterization, cell biological behaviors, pharmacokinetic, tissue distribution and the in vivo antitumor activity, were investigated as well.",

            "text": "The time evolution of the protein corona formed on different-sized gold NPs ranging from 4 to 40 nm in the cell culture media with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) was demonstrated by Casals and co-workers [52]. Protein corona formed around gold NPs were analyzed by zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy which revealed a reduction of surface charge and an increment in the thickness of protein corona layer. Albumin was shown to be the most abundant protein on the surface of NPs by mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona. Furthermore, they reported that loosely bound proteins will over time evolve to form an irreversible bound protein. The evolution of protein corona after NPs were transferred from plasma into cytosolic fluid was illustrated by Lundqvist and co-workers [38]. Various NPs such as 9-nm silica, 50-nm polystyrene, and 50-nm carboxyl-modified polystyrene particles were employed in this study. It was observed that the protein corona considerably evolves in the second biological medium. Yet, the final corona preserves a \"fingerprint\" of prior history. This can be beneficial to determine the transport pathways of NPs. \n\nThe changes in the adsorption pattern of serum proteins over time from 5 to 360 min were quantitatively and qualitatively investigated by Nagayama and co-workers [53]. They used SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to asses 50-nm lecithin-coated polystyrene NP at different times. The quantitative study revealed that the total amount of adsorbed proteins increased over time. The qualitative study indicated variation in the kinds of proteins adsorbed since the amount of some proteins increased over time whereas others decreased. Complement C3, IgG, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) showed increment over time. On the contrary, concentration of albumin remained constant.",

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

The change in particle size, zeta potential, hemotoxicity, cellular uptake/cancer cells targeting potential, and MRI characteristics of nanosized magnetic particles were reduced because of the adsorption of human serum. Meanwhile, associated with raised serum and particle concentrations, Apolipoprotein E (APOE = gene, apoE = protein) is absorbed in the surface of nanosized magnetic particles besides serum albumin (HAS) and transferrin (TF). But there existed no conspicuous primary-secondary structural developments noticed in serum proteins by various approaches, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and circular dichroism (CDS). Hemolysis evaluation offers nearly no hemolysis at the approved concentrations (up to 1 mg/mL) for nanosized magnetic particles compared with the sodium dodecyl sulfate (positive control). Moreover, the developed internalization and uptake of magnetic nanoparticles through the C4-2B cell line appears to have been confirmed during incubation with human serum (HS). Following the adsorption of serum protein to the surface of nanosized magnetic particles, the immediate proximity within T1 (~1.33-1.73 s) and T2(~12.35-13.43 ms) times of relaxation permitted nanosized magnetic particles to maintain intrinsic magnetic resonance imaging potential even after adsorption of biomolecular protein. All high-level clinical parameters could dictate the translation to clinical practice and the use of this formulation for next-generation nanoscience for drug delivery (DD), cancer targeting, imaging, and theranostics applications [107].",

These findings emphasize the potential of cationic lipids for lung-specific mRNA delivery. \n\nCurrently, limited attention is given to the active targeting strategy of adding targeting molecules to LNPs, possibly due to the relatively underdeveloped research on ligands for targeting lung cells. Based on our investigation, currently only two ligands have been utilized for pulmonary active targeting strategies for mRNA-LNPs. Specifically, pulmonary epithelial cells can internalize plasma membrane vesicle-associated protein 1 (PV1) through CvME [158]. Building upon this, Li et al. [154] successfully enhanced mRNA expression in lung epithelial cells by covalently binding \u03b1PV1 antibodies to the surface of mRNA-LNPs. Besides, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) serves as a target for endothelial cells [159]. Therefore, Parhiz et al. [153] coupled monoclonal antibodies targeting PECAM1 with mRNA-LNPs and successfully targeted pulmonary endothelial cells. As a result, the reported protein signal in the lungs increased 25-fold compared to that in nontargeted counterparts. The study further revealed that the pulmonary delivery of PECAM-1 targeted mRNA-LNPs was independent of ApoE.",

            "text": "In addition to the in vitro evaluation of ionizable lipid candidates, we evaluated ionizable lipid candidates in vivo. LNPs with high transfection ability in previous data were pooled and formulated with mFLuc to confirm their biodistribution and FLuc expression. Sizes of mFLuc-loaded 244C10, 245C10, 246C10 LNPs were validated before injection. The mean particle size of LNPs remained relatively similar (60 to 70 nm). Formulated LNPs were intravenously injected to C57BL/6 mice. Luminescence was evaluated 3 hours after injection via live-animal and ex vivo organ imaging. As shown in Fig. 3, 244C10, 245C10, and 246C10 LNPs mediated the liver-specific delivery and expression of mFLuc. Like the in vitro cellular study, 246C10 LNPs showed the highest luciferase expression in the liver. In addition, ex vivo imaging of five different organs (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and heart) supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc using 246C10 LNPs. \n\nTo figure out the impact of ApoE on the cellular uptake of 246C10 LNPs in vivo, we also evaluated luciferase expression in ApoE knockout mice (fig. S5, A to D). By injecting ApoE-associated 246C10 LNPs in the ApoE knockout mice, luciferase expression was substantially increased in the liver. The result was consistent with in vitro cellular uptake results and demonstrated that ApoE association could facilitate the delivery of 246C10 LNPs to the liver. Next, we investigated the biodistribution of mRNA-loaded LNPs. Given the fact that injected LNPs (<100 nm) were mostly distributed to the liver, the question was which types of liver cells mostly uptake these LNPs. Previously, Chen et al. (22) reported on the size-dependent gene silencing of LNPs in hepatocytes, following intravenous injection. Upon entering systemic circulation, LNPs (<100 nm) were mostly accumulated in the liver.",

            "text": "In particular, the plasma proteins bind to the exogenous NPs, forming 'protein corona' on their surface, which immensely modulates biodistribution, therapeutic effects, and the toxicity of NPs [94][95][96]. When the protein corona contains opsonin as one of its constituents, the NPs undergo opsonin-triggered phagocytosis and accumulate in RES organs like the liver, spleen, and lungs, resulting in off-target distribution and rapid clearance from the circulation. Some vital factors determine the amount and diversity of the proteins present in the corona, such as the physicochemical properties of NPs, exposure time, and abundance of plasma proteins. It was found that NPs with hydrophobic and highly positive or negative surface charge demonstrated a higher tendency to form a protein corona than hydrophilic and neutral-charged particles [25,97]. NPs coated with PEG could protect the NPs from interacting with the plasma proteins through stealth effects which are highly dependent on PEG length and density [98,99]. As shown in Supplemental Table S1, unmodified SSNs showed affinity towards different kinds of proteins, leading to the distribution of the particles to RES organs and other vital organs. This might lower the amount of siRNA-nanocomplex in the circulation (i.e., shortening its half-life) owing to the rapid clearance, thus reducing the transportation of an adequate amount of siRNA into the target tumour site. The cationic domain of SSNs (Sr 2+ ) could interact electrostatically with negatively charged proteins available in the blood plasma, reducing their stability in blood. On the other hand, surface-functionalization of SSNs with PEG resulted in less entrapment of the proteins entrapment on their surface, as shown in Supplementary Table S2 and Figure 11A. The hydrophilic PEG layer on SSNs seemingly hindered the adsorption of different types of proteins on the particle surface due to the reduction of surface charge. Less interaction with opsonin proteins leads to higher stability in plasma, which might improve the accumulation in the target tumour cells.",

            "text": "As mentioned before, in the case of Tw80 coated NPs, the adsorption of apolipoproteins ApoE and ApoA from the blood plasma as part of the protein corona formation has been shown to stimulate the interaction with low-density lipoprotein receptors LRP1 and LRP2 on brain endothelial cells, leading to receptor-mediated NP transcytosis (59, 66). In the case of SDS, its capability to disrupt the BBB due to amphipilic interactions with major membrane components, as well as by interacting with specific biochemical intracellular pathways of brain endothelial cells has been also demonstrated in previous works (21,67,68). Although mechanisms of internalization of SDS coated NPs through the BBB have been less studied, it has been observed that the protein corona is mainly composed of various apolipoproteins, suggesting that SDSfunctionalized NPs could be also taken up into the brain tissue via an interaction with LDL receptors (69)(70)(71). \n\nBesides corona components and receptor interactions, NP size represents a further relevant factor for transiting the BBB. Indeed, the inverse relationship between particle size and uptake of NPs within the brain parenchyma has been demonstrated in numerous studies (38,(72)(73)(74). It has been pointed out that the ideal diameter to overcome the BBB seems to be in the range of 10 to 200 nm, a criterion that fits with all NPs used in the present study (44). As for peripheral organs, no differential size-dependent NP brain uptake was expected, given the minor differences in size of the NPs used. Consistent with this, no statistically significant differences in brain accumulation were evidenced at 4 h between NPs. However, a higher brain concentration of PFDL NPs with both stabilizers was observed at 24 h, when compared to PLLA NPs. We speculate that other factors unrelated to the minimal differences in NP size and more likely associated to the degradability of PLLA NPs may explain their faster disappearance in brain slices 24 h after injection.",

            "text": "In addition to active targeting of hepatocytes via ASGPR by GalNAc-modified formulations, uptake of lipid formulations can be also achieved by LDLR-mediated endocytosis. For example, cholesterol-siRNA direct conjugates for apolipoprotein B (ApoB) silencing have been found to exhibit gene silencing activity in hepatocytes in vivo [136]. LDLR-mediated uptake was observed due to interactions of cholesterol with serum proteins. The same approach was used for ASO direct conjugates by Watanabe et al. to enhance uptake and ASO activity in hepatocytes [131].\n\nFurthermore, it was found that neutral liposomes interact mostly with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the blood, which directs the transport to hepatocytes by LDLR-mediated endocytosis [101][102][103]. Based on this observation, it was concluded that LNPs, multicomponent mixtures of cholesterol, an ionizable, cationic lipid, neutral helper lipids and a PEG-lipid for nucleic acid compaction, which appear almost neutral in serum, interact in a similar way with ApoE [104]. Thus, ApoE was identified as an endogenous ligand mediating the hepatocytic uptake of LNPs via LDLR [104].\n\nIn particular, Patisiran (Onpattro), the first siRNA product which was approved by FDA and EMA in 2018, is using LDLR interaction for the delivery of siRNA against transthyretin (TTR) mRNA to treat hereditary TTR mediated amyloidosis. By using a sheddable PEG-component, the formation of ApoE protein corona was observed, resulting in hepatocyte uptake via LDL receptor [137,138]. In a recent phase 1 clinical study by Gilmore et al. the therapeutic effect of Cas9-mRNA/sgRNA targeting TTR, encapsulated by LNPs was evaluated. As a result of efficient TTR gene knockout, an average decrease of 87% of TTR protein levels was observed after one month in the patient group that received 0.",

ApoE is also internalized by binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) alone (Ji et al., 1998)(Al-Haideri et al., 1997) or via a mechanism involving both HSPGs and LRP (Ji et al., 1993)(Ji et al., 1994). Intracellularly, apoE modulates lipid metabolism (Schwiegelshohn et al., 1995)(Kuipers et al., 1996) and functions in the routing of internalized lipoprotein remnants (Tabas et al., 1991)(Tabas et al., 2002).",

We questioned whether apoE would also modulate intracellular metabolism of TGRP in addition to its effects on particle uptake. We prepared model TGRP with triolein and cholesteryl oleate (1:1, w/w) as the core lipids, emulsified by egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and containing a non-degradable marker, [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether. Particles were intermediate density lipoprotein-sized as determined by core lipid/phospholipid ratios (2.0-3.0/1) and gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. Emulsions were incubated with J774 macrophages for 5 min to 6 h at core lipid concentrations of 300-1200 \u03bcg/ml and 0-0.2 \u03bcg recombinant apoE/mg core lipid. Particle uptake was determined by [3H]cholesteryl ether uptake and fluorescence microscopy in the absence and presence of apoE. Similar uptake of particles with and without apoE was achieved by utilizing a 4 times higher particle concentration in the absence of apoE. At equivalent levels of uptake, particles with apoE lead to one-half of the triglyceride mass accumulation and twice the triglyceride utilization as compared to particles without apoE. Further, apoE doubles cell cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and to a lesser extent (30%) increases cholesteryl ester resynthesis by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. Particles, both with and without apoE, reach the lysosomal compartment as determined by co-localization with fluorescein-labeled \u03b12-macroglobulin. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in enhancing TGRP uptake, apoE has additional effects on modulating the cellular metabolism of both triglyceride and cholesteryl ester, after particle internalization.",
                    "[15894574 | Tabas et al. | 1991 | Citations: 66]": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) are internalized by the same receptor in mouse peritoneal macrophages and yet their endocytic patterns differ; beta-VLDL is targeted to both widely distributed and perinuclear vesicles, whereas LDL is targeted almost entirely to perinuclear lysosomes. This endocytic divergence may have important metabolic consequences since beta-VLDL is catabolized slower than LDL and is a more potent stimulator of acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) than LDL. The goal of this study was to explore the determinants of beta-VLDL responsible for its pattern of endocytic targeting. Fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that large, intestinally derived, apoprotein (Apo) E-rich beta-VLDL was targeted mostly to widely distributed vesicles, whereas small, hepatically derived beta-VLDL was targeted more centrally (like LDL). Furthermore, the large beta-VLDL had a higher ACAT-stimulatory potential than the smaller beta-VLDL. The basis for these differences was not due to fundamental differences in the means of uptake; both large and small beta-VLDL were internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (i.e., not phagocytosis) involving the interaction of Apo E of the beta-VLDL with the macrophage LDL receptor. However, large beta-VLDL was much more resistant to acid-mediated release from LDL receptors than small beta-VLDL. Furthermore, partial neutralization of the multiple Apo Es on these particles by immunotitration resulted in a more perinuclear endocytic pattern, a lower ACAT-stimulatory potential, and an increased sensitivity to acid- mediated receptor release. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of the multivalent Apo Es of large beta- VLDL with multiple macrophage LDL receptors leads to a diminished or retarded release of the beta-VLDL from its receptor in the acidic sorting endosome which, in turn, may lead to the widely distributed endocytic pattern of large beta-VLDL. These findings may represent a physiologically relevant example of a previously described laboratory phenomenon whereby receptor cross-linking by multivalent ligands leads to a change in receptor targeting.",
                    "[29758902 | Al-Haideri et al. | 1997 | Citations: 78]": "We explored potential mechanisms of non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated uptake of triglyceride-rich particles (TGRP) in the presence of apolipoprotein E (apo E). Human fibroblasts were incubated with model intermediate-density lipoprotein- (IDL-) sized TGRP (10-1000 microg of neutral lipid/mL) containing apo E. The extent of receptor-mediated uptake of TGRP was assessed with (a) an anti-apo E monoclonal antibody, which blocks receptor interaction; (b) incubation with heparin; (c) normal vs LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts; and (d) receptor-associated protein (RAP) to determine the potential contribution of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan- (HSPG-) mediated uptake was examined with or without the addition of heparinase and heparitinase to cell incubation mixtures. At low particle concentrations (</=100 microg of neutral lipid/mL), almost all apo E-TGRP uptake was via the LDL receptor. At higher particle concentrations, within the physiologic range (>250 microg of neutral lipid/mL), most (>/=60%) particle uptake and internalization was via HSPG-mediated pathways. This HSPG pathway did not involve classical lipoprotein receptors, such as LRP or the LDL receptor. These data suggest that in peripheral tissues, such as the arterial wall, apo E may act in TGRP as a ligand for uptake not only via the LDL receptor and LRP pathways but also via HSPG pathways that are receptor-independent. Thus, at physiologic particle concentrations apo E-TGRP can be bound and internalized in certain cells by relatively low affinity but high capacity HSPG-mediated pathways.",

This hypothesis was tested by transient inactivation of LRP in vivo. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), a dominant negative regulator of LRP function, was transferred by an adenoviral vector to the livers of mice lacking LDLR (LDLR-/-). The inactivation of LRP by RAP was associated with a marked accumulation of chylomicron remnants in LDLR-/- mice and to a lesser degree in normal mice, suggesting that both LDLR and LRP are involved in remnant clearance.",

The current studies, designed to determine the mechanism for the differential intracellular accumulation or retention of apoE, demonstrate that apoE3- and apoE4-containing \u03b2-very low density lipoproteins (\u03b2-VLDL) possess similar cell binding and internalization and delivery of cholesterol to the cells. However, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, analysis of extracted cellular proteins, or quantitation of 125I-apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL, there was a 2\u20133-fold greater accumulation of apoE3 than apoE4 in Neuro-2a cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes (HepG2) after 1\u20132 h, and this differential was maintained for up to 48 h. ApoE2 also accumulated in Neuro-2a cells to a greater extent than apoE4. The differential effect was mediated by the apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL and not by free apoE. Neither the low density lipoprotein receptor nor the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein was responsible for the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4, since cells deficient in either or both of these receptors also displayed the differential accumulation. The effect appears to be mediated primarily by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The retention of both apoE3 and apoE4 was markedly reduced, and the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was eliminated both in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that did not express HSPG and in HSPG-expressing cells treated with heparinase. The data suggest that cell surface HSPG directly mediate the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins, that the differential accumulation/retention of apoE by cells is mediated via HSPG, and that there is a differential intracellular handling of the specific apoE isoforms."

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association.

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo.",

To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity.

We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery.

In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206].

LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA.

This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

We show that multiple cell signaling effectors are required for initial cellular entry of LNPs through macropinocytosis, including proton pumps, mTOR and cathepsins. siRNA delivery is substantially reduced as \u224570% of the internalized siRNA undergoes exocytosis through egress of LNPs from late endosomes/lysosomes.

Yan et al. demonstrated the hepatic clearance of liposomes via ApoE as a ligand\u2212receptormediated uptake process using ApoE-deficient mice."

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation.",

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery.

Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM.",

The results from these early clinical trials suggest that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and the novel ionizable lipids that comprise them, will be important materials in this emerging field of medicine. A persistent theme in the use of materials for biomedical applications has been the incorporation of biodegradability as a means to improve biocompatibility and/or to facilitate elimination. Therefore, the aim of this work was to further advance the LNP platform through the development of novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. As a representative example of this novel class of biodegradable lipids, the lipid evaluated in this work displays rapid elimination from plasma and tissues, substantially improved tolerability in preclinical studies, while maintaining in vivo potency on par with that of the most advanced lipids currently available."

To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

(Mendes et al., 2022) Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. (Kon et al., 2023) ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver.",

Optimized iPhos lipids are composed of one pH-switchable zwitterion and three hydrophobic tails, which adopt a cone shape in endosomal acidic environments to facilitate membrane hexagonal transformation and subsequent cargo release from endosomes. Structure\u2013activity relationships reveal that iPhos chemical structure can control in vivo efficacy and organ selectivity. iPhos lipids synergistically function with various helper lipids to formulate multi-component lipid nanoparticles (called iPLNPs) for selective organ targeting.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022).

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

In mice, non-human primates, and humans, LNPs deliver RNA to hepatocytes by adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). A growing number of LNPs can deliver RNA to nonhepatocytes, suggesting that ApoE- and LDLR-independent interactions could affect LNP tropism. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a universal DNA barcoding system that quantifies how chemically distinct LNPs deliver small interfering RNA in any mouse model, including genetic knockouts. We quantified how 98 different LNPs targeted 11 cell types in wildtype, LDLR-/-, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and ApoE-/- mice, studying how these genes, which traffic endogenous lipids, affected LNP delivery. These data identified a novel, stereopure LNP that targets Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes in an ApoE-independent manner. These results suggest that non-ApoE interactions can affect the tropism of LNP-RNA drugs.",

Recently, LNPs have delivered mRNA to non-hepatocytes in mice and non-human primates, suggesting they can target new cell types via ApoE- and LDLR-independent pathways. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how 60 LNPs delivered mRNA with cell type resolution in wild-type mice and three knockout mouse strains related to lipid trafficking: ApoE-/-, LDLR-/-, and PCSK9-/-. These data suggest that the hydrophobic tail length of diketopiperazine-based lipids can be changed to drive ApoE- and LDLR-independent delivery in vivo. More broadly, the results support the hypothesis that endogenous LNP trafficking can be tuned by modifying lipid chemistry."

The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016).

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",

However, there are numerous biological barriers that hinder nucleic acid delivery to target cells and tissues. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed to protect nucleic acids from degradation and mediate their intracellular delivery, it is challenging to predict how alterations in LNP formulation parameters influence delivery to different organs. In this study, we utilized high-throughput in vivo screening to probe for structure-function relationships of intravenously administered LNPs along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to measure the binding affinity of LNPs to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein implicated in the clearance and uptake of lipoproteins by the liver. High-throughput in vivo screening of a library consisting of 96 LNPs identified several formulations containing the helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) that preferentially accumulated in the liver, while identical LNPs that substituted DOPE with the helper lipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) preferentially accumulated in the spleen. Using QCM-D, it was found that one DOPE-containing LNP formulation (LNP 42) had stronger interactions with ApoE than an identical LNP formulation that substituted DOPE with DSPC (LNP 90). In order to further validate our findings, we formulated LNP 42 and LNP 90 to encapsulate Cy3-siRNA or mRNA encoding for firefly luciferase. The DSPC-containing LNP (LNP 90) was found to increase delivery to the spleen for both siRNA (two-fold) and mRNA (five-fold). In terms of liver delivery, the DOPE-containing LNP (LNP 42) enhanced mRNA delivery to the liver by two-fold and improved liver transfection by three-fold. Understanding the role of the helper lipid in LNP biodistribution and ApoE adsorption may aid in the future design of LNPs for nucleic acid therapeutics.",
                    "[252544644 | Johnson et al. | 2022 | Citations: 34]": "Within the field of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, the focus has been mainly placed on organ level delivery, which can mask cellular level effects consequential to therapeutic applications. Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes."

Differentiated THP-1 cells can also produce ApoE.

Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE (G\u00f6ppert et al., 2005). In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain (Aggarwal et al., 2009). Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs (Aggarwal et al., 2009)."

Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

The composition of this corona depends on both the physicochemical properties of the LNPs and the biological environment they encounter. Among the various serum proteins that form the corona, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has emerged as particularly important, especially for LNPs designed to target the liver. ApoE is a major component of the corona formed on clinically relevant LNP formulations used for mRNA delivery, including those in COVID-19 vaccines. Understanding how ApoE and other serum proteins interact with LNPs is crucial for developing targeted delivery systems and predicting their in vivo behavior. This knowledge has significant implications for the design of LNPs for various therapeutic applications, including gene therapy, RNA interference, and vaccine development. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

This hypothesis was tested by transient inactivation of LRP in vivo. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), a dominant negative regulator of LRP function, was transferred by an adenoviral vector to the livers of mice lacking LDLR (LDLR-/-). The inactivation of LRP by RAP was associated with a marked accumulation of chylomicron remnants in LDLR-/- mice and to a lesser degree in normal mice, suggesting that both LDLR and LRP are involved in remnant clearance."

                            "We explored potential mechanisms of non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated uptake of triglyceride-rich particles (TGRP) in the presence of apolipoprotein E (apo E). Human fibroblasts were incubated with model intermediate-density lipoprotein- (IDL-) sized TGRP (10-1000 microg of neutral lipid/mL) containing apo E. The extent of receptor-mediated uptake of TGRP was assessed with (a) an anti-apo E monoclonal antibody, which blocks receptor interaction; (b) incubation with heparin; (c) normal vs LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts; and (d) receptor-associated protein (RAP) to determine the potential contribution of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan- (HSPG-) mediated uptake was examined with or without the addition of heparinase and heparitinase to cell incubation mixtures. At low particle concentrations (</=100 microg of neutral lipid/mL), almost all apo E-TGRP uptake was via the LDL receptor. At higher particle concentrations, within the physiologic range (>250 microg of neutral lipid/mL), most (>/=60%) particle uptake and internalization was via HSPG-mediated pathways. This HSPG pathway did not involve classical lipoprotein receptors, such as LRP or the LDL receptor. These data suggest that in peripheral tissues, such as the arterial wall, apo E may act in TGRP as a ligand for uptake not only via the LDL receptor and LRP pathways but also via HSPG pathways that are receptor-independent. Thus, at physiologic particle concentrations apo E-TGRP can be bound and internalized in certain cells by relatively low affinity but high capacity HSPG-mediated pathways."

The current studies, designed to determine the mechanism for the differential intracellular accumulation or retention of apoE, demonstrate that apoE3- and apoE4-containing \u03b2-very low density lipoproteins (\u03b2-VLDL) possess similar cell binding and internalization and delivery of cholesterol to the cells. However, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, analysis of extracted cellular proteins, or quantitation of 125I-apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL, there was a 2\u20133-fold greater accumulation of apoE3 than apoE4 in Neuro-2a cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes (HepG2) after 1\u20132 h, and this differential was maintained for up to 48 h. ApoE2 also accumulated in Neuro-2a cells to a greater extent than apoE4. The differential effect was mediated by the apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL and not by free apoE. Neither the low density lipoprotein receptor nor the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein was responsible for the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4, since cells deficient in either or both of these receptors also displayed the differential accumulation. The effect appears to be mediated primarily by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The retention of both apoE3 and apoE4 was markedly reduced, and the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was eliminated both in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that did not express HSPG and in HSPG-expressing cells treated with heparinase. The data suggest that cell surface HSPG directly mediate the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins, that the differential accumulation/retention of apoE by cells is mediated via HSPG, and that there is a differential intracellular handling of the specific apoE isoforms."

Crucial to transporting and metabolizing lipids, ApoE regulates lipoprotein and cholesterol levels in the plasma via high-affinity binding to the family of LDL receptors [70](Hauser et al., 2011). The liver is the main organ for clearing ApoE-binding lipoproteins; hence, systemically delivered LNPs would bind ApoE and preferentially home to the liver (Kumar et al., 2014)(Sebastiani et al., 2021). A study performed on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice using cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA demonstrated that the hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs is ApoE dependent, suggesting that LNP charge plays a role in LNP tissue tropism (Akinc et al., 2010)."

                            "ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons (Cooper, 1997). Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes (Yan et al., 2005), and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism",
                            "The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size (Francia et al., 2020). Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines."

We questioned whether apoE would also modulate intracellular metabolism of TGRP in addition to its effects on particle uptake. We prepared model TGRP with triolein and cholesteryl oleate (1:1, w/w) as the core lipids, emulsified by egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and containing a non-degradable marker, [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether. Particles were intermediate density lipoprotein-sized as determined by core lipid/phospholipid ratios (2.0-3.0/1) and gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. Emulsions were incubated with J774 macrophages for 5 min to 6 h at core lipid concentrations of 300-1200 \u03bcg/ml and 0-0.2 \u03bcg recombinant apoE/mg core lipid. Particle uptake was determined by [3H]cholesteryl ether uptake and fluorescence microscopy in the absence and presence of apoE. Similar uptake of particles with and without apoE was achieved by utilizing a 4 times higher particle concentration in the absence of apoE. At equivalent levels of uptake, particles with apoE lead to one-half of the triglyceride mass accumulation and twice the triglyceride utilization as compared to particles without apoE. Further, apoE doubles cell cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and to a lesser extent (30%) increases cholesteryl ester resynthesis by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. Particles, both with and without apoE, reach the lysosomal compartment as determined by co-localization with fluorescein-labeled \u03b12-macroglobulin. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in enhancing TGRP uptake, apoE has additional effects on modulating the cellular metabolism of both triglyceride and cholesteryl ester, after particle internalization."

                            "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) are internalized by the same receptor in mouse peritoneal macrophages and yet their endocytic patterns differ; beta-VLDL is targeted to both widely distributed and perinuclear vesicles, whereas LDL is targeted almost entirely to perinuclear lysosomes. This endocytic divergence may have important metabolic consequences since beta-VLDL is catabolized slower than LDL and is a more potent stimulator of acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) than LDL. The goal of this study was to explore the determinants of beta-VLDL responsible for its pattern of endocytic targeting. Fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that large, intestinally derived, apoprotein (Apo) E-rich beta-VLDL was targeted mostly to widely distributed vesicles, whereas small, hepatically derived beta-VLDL was targeted more centrally (like LDL). Furthermore, the large beta-VLDL had a higher ACAT-stimulatory potential than the smaller beta-VLDL. The basis for these differences was not due to fundamental differences in the means of uptake; both large and small beta-VLDL were internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (i.e., not phagocytosis) involving the interaction of Apo E of the beta-VLDL with the macrophage LDL receptor. However, large beta-VLDL was much more resistant to acid-mediated release from LDL receptors than small beta-VLDL. Furthermore, partial neutralization of the multiple Apo Es on these particles by immunotitration resulted in a more perinuclear endocytic pattern, a lower ACAT-stimulatory potential, and an increased sensitivity to acid- mediated receptor release. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of the multivalent Apo Es of large beta- VLDL with multiple macrophage LDL receptors leads to a diminished or retarded release of the beta-VLDL from its receptor in the acidic sorting endosome which, in turn, may lead to the widely distributed endocytic pattern of large beta-VLDL. These findings may represent a physiologically relevant example of a previously described laboratory phenomenon whereby receptor cross-linking by multivalent ligands leads to a change in receptor targeting."

                "tldr": "ApoE plays a critical role in directing LNPs to the liver by binding to the LNP surface and facilitating uptake via LDL receptors on hepatocytes. This endogenous targeting mechanism is essential for liver-directed LNP therapies, as demonstrated by significantly reduced liver uptake in ApoE knockout mice. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE) has emerged as a key mediator in the biomolecular corona that determines the fate of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in vivo. When LNPs enter the bloodstream, they rapidly interact with serum proteins, with ApoE playing a particularly critical role in targeting LNPs to the liver. The FDA-approved siRNA therapy Onpattro\u00ae exemplifies the importance of this mechanism, as its liver tropism stems from the formation of an ApoE-rich biomolecular corona that enables specific hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"221122365\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nExperimental evidence from ApoE knockout mice has conclusively demonstrated the essential role of ApoE in LNP delivery to hepatocytes. Studies show remarkably reduced LNP activity in ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice compared to wild-type animals <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reduced activity can be rescued by pre-incubating LNPs with ApoE before administration, confirming ApoE's direct role in facilitating hepatocyte uptake <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nImportantly, the interaction between ApoE and LNPs is selective and depends on LNP surface properties. ApoE primarily acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) with near-neutral surface charge at physiological pH, but not for cationic LNPs (cLNPs) with positive surface charge <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"52856606\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al._1, 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This distinction is critical for designing LNPs with specific targeting properties.\n\nThe mechanism of ApoE-mediated targeting involves LNP binding to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), which are highly expressed on hepatocytes. The ApoE adsorbed onto LNPs transforms them into biomimicking remnant chylomicrons that are efficiently recognized and internalized by hepatocytes via LDLR-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"237898023\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism has been further validated through studies in LDLR knockout mice, which showed diminished LNP activity <Paper corpusId=\"246832111\" paperTitle=\"(Semple et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond liver hepatocytes, ApoE-mediated uptake may also be relevant for other cell types expressing LDL receptors. For instance, dendritic cells and monocytes, which are target cells for mRNA vaccines, highly express LDL receptors, suggesting that ApoE binding could promote LNP uptake in these cells as well <Paper corpusId=\"232422550\" paperTitle=\"(Verbeke et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe extent of ApoE adsorption to LNPs can be modulated by their composition and surface properties. Studies have shown that increasing the polyethylene glycol (PEG) content in LNPs reduces their association with ApoE, thereby decreasing hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This effect can be strategically exploited to redirect LNPs to non-hepatic tissues by introducing exogenous targeting ligands that can bypass the need for ApoE-mediated uptake <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advances in LNP design have explored ways to either enhance or circumvent ApoE-mediated targeting. For example, incorporating helper lipids like DOPE (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine) instead of DSPC (distearoylphosphatidylcholine) can strengthen interactions with ApoE and enhance liver targeting <Paper corpusId=\"262128139\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles have been developed to overcome liver accumulation by adsorbing different types of serum proteins that direct them to non-liver organs <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe discovery of ApoE's role in LNP targeting has transformed our understanding of nanoparticle biodistribution and opened new avenues for designing targeted delivery systems. Rather than viewing the protein corona as an obstacle, researchers now recognize that controlled protein adsorption can be exploited as an \"endogenous targeting\" strategy to achieve tissue-specific delivery <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and metabolites), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has shown to play a crucial role for LNP uptake in hepatocytes. LNP-siRNA genesilencing activity was significantly decreased in an ApoE knockout mouse model (ApoE\u2212/\u2212), and activity could be rescued by preincubating the particles with ApoE before administration. In a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout model (LDLR\u2212/\u2212), LNP-siRNA formulations displayed less gene-silencing activity (leading to higher ED 50 values) than in wild-type animals. LNP activity could be rescued through addition of a multivalent targeting ligand, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), for the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor, thereby promoting internalization through an alternative endocytic route. Authors concluded that ApoE association with siRNA-LNP systems plays a major role in triggering LNP uptake into hepatocytes by clathrinmediated endocytosis via the LDL receptor."

                            "ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons (Cooper, 1997). Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes (Yan et al., 2005), and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism",
                            "The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size (Francia et al., 2020). Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines."

Using knockout models, Akinc and colleagues demonstrated that uptake of LNP by hepatocytes was largely dependent on both ApoE and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) (Akinc et al., 2010)(Kumar et al., 2014). However, not all delivery systems depend on ApoE targeting. In the case of the potent in vivo activity lipid-like molecule, C12-200, uptake was reported to be through an ApoE independent, micropinocytosis pathway (Love et al., 2010)(Dahlman et al., 2014)(Sahay et al., 2013)."

There are good reasons to believe that ApoE binding also plays a critical role in the uptake of the mRNA LNP vaccines after intramuscular injection. Vaccine targeted cell types (see Mode of action), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, highly express LDL receptors and other scavenger receptors (Liang et al., 2017). Moreover, the transfection of human DCs with mRNA LNPs in an in vitro setting was also reported to be promoted in the presence of ApoE (Pardi et al., 2015)."

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

                            "Endogenous targeting is a special passive targeting, which mainly means that NPs will combine with different biomolecules in systemic circulation, to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\", especially with protein in blood to form a \"protein corona, \" which can be transported to target organs or cells without targeting ligands (Cifuentes\u2010Rius et al., 2020)",
                            "The adsorption process of protein coronas is known to be difficult to control, and protein coronas can even mask the targeting ligands, leading to loss of targeting efficacy. Based on these results, the protein corona is considered an \"enemy\" in NPs targeting strategies, necessitating resistance to protein corona adsorption in vivo. However, emerging evidence shows that some specific protein coronas in the blood can improve mRNA NP delivery to specific tissues [91]. For example, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with liver-specific delivery of NPs.\n\nBesides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs. LNPs with DOPE preferentially accumulate in the liver, and the interaction between LNPs with DOPE and ApoE was stronger than that with DSPC [118]. Protein coronas other than ApoE can be formed by modifying the lipid chemistry of LNPs. As a result, LNPs can enter hepatocytes through other endocytosis routes besides CME. Miao et al. [107] demonstrated that by incorporating alkyne and ester groups into cKK-E12-LNPs, serum albumin gets attached LNP surface instead of ApoE surface, and LNPs entered hepatocytes through CvME and micropinocytosis.\n\nFor liver diseases, mRNA-LNPs can be delivered to hepatocytes by endogenous targeting. In a mouse model of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, Yang et al. [14] found that the ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting was not significantly affected. They synthesized LNPs containing ALC-0315, DSCP, cholesterol, and ALC-0159, and the LNPs successfully delivered HNF4A mRNA to hepatocytes through ApoE action. However, under specific pathological conditions, such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), the LDLRs almost disappeared, seriously affecting the ApoE-based endogenous targeting [119]."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Experiments with cells lacking HSPGs or treated with heparinase show markedly reduced retention of ApoE, confirming the critical role of HSPGs in this process <Paper corpusId=\"7559364\" paperTitle=\"(Ji et al., 1998)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe avidity of ApoE binding to cell receptors is enhanced by the presentation of multiple ApoE molecules on the LNP surface. The exchange of ApoE from chylomicrons and high-density lipoproteins results in a high concentration of ApoE ligands on the LNP surface, creating strong avidity for LDL receptors <Paper corpusId=\"259895011\" paperTitle=\"(Patel et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multivalent presentation of ApoE on LNPs may also affect the endocytic pattern and intracellular processing of the particles <Paper corpusId=\"15894574\" paperTitle=\"(Tabas et al., 1991)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOnce internalized, ApoE continues to influence the intracellular fate of LNPs. Within cells, ApoE modulates lipid metabolism by enhancing triglyceride utilization and increasing cholesteryl ester hydrolysis <Paper corpusId=\"1341130\" paperTitle=\"(Schwiegelshohn et al., 1995)\" isShortName></Paper>. These intracellular functions of ApoE may contribute to the efficient processing and release of therapeutic cargo from LNPs after cellular uptake.\n\nThe ApoE-mediated uptake mechanism is relevant beyond hepatocytes, as other cell types expressing LDL receptors can also internalize ApoE-coated LNPs. For instance, dendritic cells and monocytes, which are target cells for mRNA vaccines, highly express LDL receptors, suggesting that ApoE binding facilitates LNP uptake in these cells as well <Paper corpusId=\"232422550\" paperTitle=\"(Verbeke et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This broader relevance of the ApoE-LDLR pathway explains why LNPs can effectively deliver therapeutic payloads to various cell types beyond the liver.\n\nAlternative uptake mechanisms can come into play when ApoE binding is reduced or absent. For example, LNPs with high PEG content have lower binding affinity for ApoE, which can be exploited to redirect LNPs to other tissues by incorporating exogenous targeting ligands <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, some LNP formulations can enter cells through ApoE-independent pathways, such as albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"218652381\" paperTitle=\"(Miao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>, providing alternative routes for cellular entry when the ApoE-LDLR pathway is not available.",

                            "ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons (Cooper, 1997). Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes (Yan et al., 2005), and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism",
                            "The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size (Francia et al., 2020). Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines."

Using knockout models, Akinc and colleagues demonstrated that uptake of LNP by hepatocytes was largely dependent on both ApoE and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) (Akinc et al., 2010)(Kumar et al., 2014). However, not all delivery systems depend on ApoE targeting. In the case of the potent in vivo activity lipid-like molecule, C12-200, uptake was reported to be through an ApoE independent, micropinocytosis pathway (Love et al., 2010)(Dahlman et al., 2014)(Sahay et al., 2013)."

This hypothesis was tested by transient inactivation of LRP in vivo. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), a dominant negative regulator of LRP function, was transferred by an adenoviral vector to the livers of mice lacking LDLR (LDLR-/-). The inactivation of LRP by RAP was associated with a marked accumulation of chylomicron remnants in LDLR-/- mice and to a lesser degree in normal mice, suggesting that both LDLR and LRP are involved in remnant clearance."

                            "We explored potential mechanisms of non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated uptake of triglyceride-rich particles (TGRP) in the presence of apolipoprotein E (apo E). Human fibroblasts were incubated with model intermediate-density lipoprotein- (IDL-) sized TGRP (10-1000 microg of neutral lipid/mL) containing apo E. The extent of receptor-mediated uptake of TGRP was assessed with (a) an anti-apo E monoclonal antibody, which blocks receptor interaction; (b) incubation with heparin; (c) normal vs LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts; and (d) receptor-associated protein (RAP) to determine the potential contribution of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan- (HSPG-) mediated uptake was examined with or without the addition of heparinase and heparitinase to cell incubation mixtures. At low particle concentrations (</=100 microg of neutral lipid/mL), almost all apo E-TGRP uptake was via the LDL receptor. At higher particle concentrations, within the physiologic range (>250 microg of neutral lipid/mL), most (>/=60%) particle uptake and internalization was via HSPG-mediated pathways. This HSPG pathway did not involve classical lipoprotein receptors, such as LRP or the LDL receptor. These data suggest that in peripheral tissues, such as the arterial wall, apo E may act in TGRP as a ligand for uptake not only via the LDL receptor and LRP pathways but also via HSPG pathways that are receptor-independent. Thus, at physiologic particle concentrations apo E-TGRP can be bound and internalized in certain cells by relatively low affinity but high capacity HSPG-mediated pathways."

The current studies, designed to determine the mechanism for the differential intracellular accumulation or retention of apoE, demonstrate that apoE3- and apoE4-containing \u03b2-very low density lipoproteins (\u03b2-VLDL) possess similar cell binding and internalization and delivery of cholesterol to the cells. However, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, analysis of extracted cellular proteins, or quantitation of 125I-apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL, there was a 2\u20133-fold greater accumulation of apoE3 than apoE4 in Neuro-2a cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes (HepG2) after 1\u20132 h, and this differential was maintained for up to 48 h. ApoE2 also accumulated in Neuro-2a cells to a greater extent than apoE4. The differential effect was mediated by the apoE-enriched \u03b2-VLDL and not by free apoE. Neither the low density lipoprotein receptor nor the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein was responsible for the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4, since cells deficient in either or both of these receptors also displayed the differential accumulation. The effect appears to be mediated primarily by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The retention of both apoE3 and apoE4 was markedly reduced, and the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was eliminated both in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that did not express HSPG and in HSPG-expressing cells treated with heparinase. The data suggest that cell surface HSPG directly mediate the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins, that the differential accumulation/retention of apoE by cells is mediated via HSPG, and that there is a differential intracellular handling of the specific apoE isoforms."

                            "The cellular uptake and delivery of siRNA or mRNA LNPs is a complex, multi-step process, beginning with the attachment of the LNP to the cell surface, cell entry by endocytosis, release of the RNA from endosome to cytosol, and binding of the RNA to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing, or to a ribosome for protein expression. The cell recognition and uptake process begins when LNPs come in contact with biological fluids, which rapidly results in the covering of the LNP surface with a corona of biomolecules, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins and coagulation factors [8,9]. Constituents of this corona act as ligands for specific cell surface receptors, initiating receptor-mediated endocytosis, and subsequent LNP internalization [10]. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) acts as the key endogenous ligand in this role, able to bind to ionizable LNPs enabling receptor-mediated endocytosis by low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R) [11,12], which are involved in cholesterol utilization and lipid homeostasis [13], and therefore widely distributed on all nucleated cells. The exchange of ApoE from chylomicrons and high-density lipoproteins results in the coating of the LNP surface with a relatively high concentration of ApoE ligands, resulting in high avidity for LDL-R."

                            "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) are internalized by the same receptor in mouse peritoneal macrophages and yet their endocytic patterns differ; beta-VLDL is targeted to both widely distributed and perinuclear vesicles, whereas LDL is targeted almost entirely to perinuclear lysosomes. This endocytic divergence may have important metabolic consequences since beta-VLDL is catabolized slower than LDL and is a more potent stimulator of acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) than LDL. The goal of this study was to explore the determinants of beta-VLDL responsible for its pattern of endocytic targeting. Fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that large, intestinally derived, apoprotein (Apo) E-rich beta-VLDL was targeted mostly to widely distributed vesicles, whereas small, hepatically derived beta-VLDL was targeted more centrally (like LDL). Furthermore, the large beta-VLDL had a higher ACAT-stimulatory potential than the smaller beta-VLDL. The basis for these differences was not due to fundamental differences in the means of uptake; both large and small beta-VLDL were internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (i.e., not phagocytosis) involving the interaction of Apo E of the beta-VLDL with the macrophage LDL receptor. However, large beta-VLDL was much more resistant to acid-mediated release from LDL receptors than small beta-VLDL. Furthermore, partial neutralization of the multiple Apo Es on these particles by immunotitration resulted in a more perinuclear endocytic pattern, a lower ACAT-stimulatory potential, and an increased sensitivity to acid- mediated receptor release. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of the multivalent Apo Es of large beta- VLDL with multiple macrophage LDL receptors leads to a diminished or retarded release of the beta-VLDL from its receptor in the acidic sorting endosome which, in turn, may lead to the widely distributed endocytic pattern of large beta-VLDL. These findings may represent a physiologically relevant example of a previously described laboratory phenomenon whereby receptor cross-linking by multivalent ligands leads to a change in receptor targeting."

                            "Apoprotein E (apoE) enhances uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (TGRP). We questioned whether apoE would also modulate intracellular metabolism of TGRP in addition to its effects on particle uptake. We prepared model TGRP with triolein and cholesteryl oleate (1:1, w/w) as the core lipids, emulsified by egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and containing a non-degradable marker, [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether. Particles were intermediate density lipoprotein-sized as determined by core lipid/phospholipid ratios (2.0-3.0/1) and gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. Emulsions were incubated with J774 macrophages for 5 min to 6 h at core lipid concentrations of 300-1200 \u03bcg/ml and 0-0.2 \u03bcg recombinant apoE/mg core lipid. Particle uptake was determined by [3H]cholesteryl ether uptake and fluorescence microscopy in the absence and presence of apoE. Similar uptake of particles with and without apoE was achieved by utilizing a 4 times higher particle concentration in the absence of apoE. At equivalent levels of uptake, particles with apoE lead to one-half of the triglyceride mass accumulation and twice the triglyceride utilization as compared to particles without apoE. Further, apoE doubles cell cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and to a lesser extent (30%) increases cholesteryl ester resynthesis by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. Particles, both with and without apoE, reach the lysosomal compartment as determined by co-localization with fluorescein-labeled \u03b12-macroglobulin. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in enhancing TGRP uptake, apoE has additional effects on modulating the cellular metabolism of both triglyceride and cholesteryl ester, after particle internalization."

There are good reasons to believe that ApoE binding also plays a critical role in the uptake of the mRNA LNP vaccines after intramuscular injection. Vaccine targeted cell types (see Mode of action), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, highly express LDL receptors and other scavenger receptors (Liang et al., 2017). Moreover, the transfection of human DCs with mRNA LNPs in an in vitro setting was also reported to be promoted in the presence of ApoE (Pardi et al., 2015)."

                            "Formulation of short interfering RNA (siRNA) into multicomponent lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is an effective strategy for hepatic delivery and therapeutic gene silencing. This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity."

                "tldr": "Multiple factors influence ApoE binding to LNPs, including LNP surface charge, PEG content, lipid composition, and helper lipid selection. These characteristics can be strategically modified to either enhance or reduce ApoE interaction, thereby controlling biodistribution and cellular targeting. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is not universal but depends significantly on several key factors that can be manipulated to control targeting and biodistribution. One of the most critical factors is the surface charge of LNPs. Ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) with near-neutral surface charge at physiological pH effectively bind ApoE, while cationic LNPs (cLNPs) with positive surface charge do not show the same dependence on ApoE for cellular uptake <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This charge-dependent interaction has significant implications for targeting, as ApoE-dependent uptake primarily directs LNPs to hepatocytes expressing LDL receptors <Paper corpusId=\"239470660\" paperTitle=\"(Zak et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPEG content and density play a crucial role in modulating ApoE binding. Higher PEG density on LNPs creates a steric barrier that reduces ApoE association, consequently diminishing hepatocyte targeting. Kumar et al. demonstrated that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have lower binding affinity for ApoE compared to those with 1.5% PEG-lipid <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This effect can be strategically exploited by incorporating exogenous targeting ligands into highly PEGylated LNPs to bypass ApoE-mediated uptake and achieve selective delivery to non-hepatic tissues <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe PEG-lipid tail length also affects ApoE adsorption. PEG-lipids with shorter lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs in circulation, inducing surface structural changes that allow ApoE adsorption and subsequent protein corona formation <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This phenomenon is exploited in FDA-approved formulations like Onpattro\u00ae, where PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG) is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, enabling targeted delivery to the liver <Paper corpusId=\"232322928\" paperTitle=\"(Sebastiani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe helper lipid composition significantly influences ApoE binding and subsequent biodistribution. LNPs containing dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) as a helper lipid show stronger interactions with ApoE compared to identical formulations using distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) <Paper corpusId=\"230532829\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced ApoE binding correlates with increased liver accumulation and improved hepatic transfection efficiency for DOPE-containing LNPs, while DSPC-containing LNPs tend to preferentially accumulate in the spleen <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface composition also plays a role in ApoE binding. DSPC and cholesterol enrichment at the LNP surface correlates with ApoE attraction <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This is consistent with ApoE's natural role in cholesterol transport. Upon ApoE binding, LNPs undergo significant structural reorganization, with ApoE inducing redistribution of lipids between the shell and core, which can impact the internal structure and cause mRNA release <Paper corpusId=\"232322928\" paperTitle=\"(Sebastiani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can also determine which proteins bind to LNPs. Johnson et al. compared two LNPs with similar physical properties (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14) and found that 5A2-SC8 LNPs preferentially bound ApoE and efficiently delivered RNA to hepatocytes, while 3A5-SC14 LNPs primarily adsorbed albumin and were taken up by Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"252544644\" paperTitle=\"(Johnson et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This demonstrates how subtle changes in LNP chemistry can dramatically alter protein corona composition and cellular targeting <Paper corpusId=\"274332884\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn some cases, different LNP formulations may exhibit varied dependence on ApoE for cellular uptake. Miao et al. found that while some LNPs were highly dependent on ApoE for gene expression, others showed enhanced expression with increased serum and albumin concentrations <Paper corpusId=\"256636125\" paperTitle=\"(Miao et al._1, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that different LNP designs can exploit alternative protein corona-mediated uptake mechanisms.\n\nRather than viewing protein corona formation as an obstacle, researchers now recognize the potential for controlled attraction of specific proteins to guide LNPs to target tissues, a concept termed \"endogenous targeting\" <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Understanding and manipulating the factors that affect ApoE binding provides a powerful approach to direct LNPs to specific tissues or to bypass liver accumulation when targeting other organs is desired.",

                            "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been shown to bind to intravenously injected LNPs. Crucial to transporting and metabolizing lipids, ApoE regulates lipoprotein and cholesterol levels in the plasma via high-affinity binding to the family of LDL receptors [70](Hauser et al., 2011). The liver is the main organ for clearing ApoE-binding lipoproteins; hence, systemically delivered LNPs would bind ApoE and preferentially home to the liver (Kumar et al., 2014)(Sebastiani et al., 2021). A study performed on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice using cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA demonstrated that the hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs is ApoE dependent, suggesting that LNP charge plays a role in LNP tissue tropism (Akinc et al., 2010)."

                            "Formulation of short interfering RNA (siRNA) into multicomponent lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is an effective strategy for hepatic delivery and therapeutic gene silencing. This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE",

They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved."

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver (Urits et al., 2020)(Sebastiani et al., 2021)."

                            "Nucleic acids, such as messenger RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, and short interfering RNAs, hold great promise for treating previously 'undruggable' diseases. However, there are numerous biological barriers that hinder nucleic acid delivery to target cells and tissues. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed to protect nucleic acids from degradation and mediate their intracellular delivery, it is challenging to predict how alterations in LNP formulation parameters influence delivery to different organs. In this study, we utilized high-throughput in vivo screening to probe for structure-function relationships of intravenously administered LNPs along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to measure the binding affinity of LNPs to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein implicated in the clearance and uptake of lipoproteins by the liver. High-throughput in vivo screening of a library consisting of 96 LNPs identified several formulations containing the helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) that preferentially accumulated in the liver, while identical LNPs that substituted DOPE with the helper lipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) preferentially accumulated in the spleen. Using QCM-D, it was found that one DOPE-containing LNP formulation (LNP 42) had stronger interactions with ApoE than an identical LNP formulation that substituted DOPE with DSPC (LNP 90). In order to further validate our findings, we formulated LNP 42 and LNP 90 to encapsulate Cy3-siRNA or mRNA encoding for firefly luciferase. The DSPC-containing LNP (LNP 90) was found to increase delivery to the spleen for both siRNA (two-fold) and mRNA (five-fold). In terms of liver delivery, the DOPE-containing LNP (LNP 42) enhanced mRNA delivery to the liver by two-fold and improved liver transfection by three-fold. Understanding the role of the helper lipid in LNP biodistribution and ApoE adsorption may aid in the future design of LNPs for nucleic acid therapeutics."

[70]Indeed, this approach has been successfully applied in the case of Onpattro, the first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP for treating hereditary disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.The liver affinity of Onpattro has been strongly linked to its ApoE-rich protein corona, particularly through the interaction with hepatocytes via ApoE-binding receptors like low-density lipoprotein receptors.

                            "Within the field of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, the focus has been mainly placed on organ level delivery, which can mask cellular level effects consequential to therapeutic applications. Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs",

                            "ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons (Cooper, 1997). Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes (Yan et al., 2005), and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism",
                            "The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size (Francia et al., 2020). Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines."

Apo M, which is found primarily on HDL, also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV, which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig. 14).

                            "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking. After intravenous administration, serum ApoE usually binds onto LNPs, leading to liver accumulation of the nanoparticles. [40,42,43] Albumin is the most abundant proteins in the serum and was reported to affect the endocytosis pathways and intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles. [41] Previous studies have shown that albumin-coated nanoparticles preferentially bind to the glycoprotein scavenger receptors gp30 and gp18 on the cell surface and promote endocytosis via caveola-mediated or micropinocytosis-related pathways. [44]45] We found that the GFP delivery efficacy of LNPs increases with increasing albumin concentrations, but is scarcely influenced by ApoE, suggesting that albumin plays a crucial role in LNPs mediated protein delivery in serum-containing media (Figure 3c)."

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity."

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

Herein, we reported a lymph-node\u2013targeting mRNA vaccine based on lipid nanoparticles named 113-O12B for cancer immunotherapy. The targeted delivery of the mRNA vaccine elicits robust CD8+ T cell responses, exhibiting excellent protective and therapeutic effects on B16F10 melanoma.

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

                            "Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. (Mendes et al., 2022) Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. (Kon et al., 2023) ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. (Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Akinc et al., 2010) Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. (Liu et al., 2021)",

These approaches include manipulating LNP composition, incorporating SORT molecules, using exogenous targeting ligands, and exploiting endogenous targeting mechanisms. (20 sources)",
                "text": "\nUnderstanding the role of the biomolecular corona has led to the development of strategic approaches to manipulate protein adsorption for targeted delivery. Rather than viewing the protein corona as an obstacle, researchers now recognize it as an opportunity for \"endogenous targeting,\" where controlled protein adsorption can be exploited to direct LNPs to specific tissues <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne primary strategy involves modulating LNP PEGylation. Higher PEG density creates a steric barrier that reduces ApoE association, thereby diminishing hepatocyte targeting. Kumar et al. demonstrated that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have lower binding affinity for ApoE compared to those with 1.5% PEG-lipid <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This effect can be strategically exploited by incorporating exogenous targeting ligands into highly PEGylated LNPs to bypass ApoE-mediated uptake and achieve selective delivery to non-hepatic tissues <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor circumstances where ApoE-mediated uptake is compromised, such as in ApoE knockout mice or LDLR knockout models, alternative targeting strategies can be employed. Akinc et al. developed an approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor expressed on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10935655\" paperTitle=\"(Tanowitz et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe selection of helper lipids can significantly influence the biomolecular corona composition. LNPs containing dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) as a helper lipid show stronger interactions with ApoE compared to formulations using distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), enhancing liver targeting <Paper corpusId=\"262128139\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, reducing or eliminating cholesterol in LNP formulations may alter protein corona formation and subsequent uptake mechanisms, as cholesterol plays an important role in enabling protein corona formation <Paper corpusId=\"264805253\" paperTitle=\"(Patel et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAlternative uptake pathways can be accessed by modifying LNP chemistry to attract different serum proteins. Miao et al. demonstrated that incorporating alkyne and ester groups into lipid tails can cause LNPs to adsorb albumin instead of ApoE, enabling cellular uptake via albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis pathways <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218652381\" paperTitle=\"(Miao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This represents an ApoE-independent mechanism for LNP delivery to hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"262128139\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA particularly promising approach involves Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, which can bypass liver accumulation by forming unique protein coronas that redirect LNPs to extrahepatic tissues <Paper corpusId=\"270137155\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._2, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanism involves desorption of PEG lipids from the LNP surface, binding of distinct proteins based on the exposed SORT molecules, and subsequent interactions with tissue-specific receptors <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMass spectrometry analysis has revealed that different SORT LNPs preferentially adsorb specific proteins: apolipoprotein E for liver targeting, vitronectin for lung targeting, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I for spleen targeting <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"251593478\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, N-series LNPs containing an amide bond in the tail can selectively deliver mRNA to the lungs, in contrast to O-series LNPs with an ester bond that predominantly target the liver <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246902168\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7122756\" paperTitle=\"(Maier et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe chemistry of ionizable lipids can also determine which proteins bind to LNPs. Johnson's team identified that LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8 preferentially adsorb ApoE and effectively deliver RNA to hepatocytes, while 3A5-SC14 LNPs primarily adsorb albumin and are taken up by Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"274332884\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This demonstrates how subtle changes in LNP chemistry can dramatically alter protein corona composition and cellular targeting.\n\nBy understanding and exploiting these mechanisms, researchers can design LNPs that selectively attract specific proteins to their corona, enabling precise control over tissue targeting and therapeutic outcomes. This approach represents a paradigm shift from attempting to avoid protein corona formation to strategically utilizing it for enhanced delivery specificity.",

                            "Instead of viewing protein corona formation as exclusively detrimental to successful NP distribution, growing evidence indicates the potential for controlled attraction of distinct proteins to aid accumulation in the targeted tissue, a concept termed endogenous targeting. [70]Indeed, this approach has been successfully applied in the case of Onpattro, the first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP for treating hereditary disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.The liver affinity of Onpattro has been strongly linked to its ApoE-rich protein corona, particularly through the interaction with hepatocytes via ApoE-binding receptors like low-density lipoprotein receptors. [71]Very recently this hallmark has been updated, as ApoE-containing high density lipoprotein enriched in NP-corona complexes was shown to be a better predictor of in vivo liver efficacy compared to sole ApoE.

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

                            "Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and metabolites), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has shown to play a crucial role for LNP uptake in hepatocytes. LNP-siRNA genesilencing activity was significantly decreased in an ApoE knockout mouse model (ApoE\u2212/\u2212), and activity could be rescued by preincubating the particles with ApoE before administration. In a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout model (LDLR\u2212/\u2212), LNP-siRNA formulations displayed less gene-silencing activity (leading to higher ED 50 values) than in wild-type animals. LNP activity could be rescued through addition of a multivalent targeting ligand, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), for the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor, thereby promoting internalization through an alternative endocytic route. Authors concluded that ApoE association with siRNA-LNP systems plays a major role in triggering LNP uptake into hepatocytes by clathrinmediated endocytosis via the LDL receptor."

                            "Abstract Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics show tremendous promise for the treatment of previously intractable human diseases but to exert their effects on cellular RNA processing they must first cross the plasma membrane by endocytosis. The conjugation of ASOs to a receptor ligand can dramatically increase their entry into certain cells and tissues, as demonstrated by the implementation of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated ASOs for Asialoglycoprotein Receptor (ASGR)-mediated uptake into liver hepatocytes. We compared the internalization and activity of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs and their parents in endogenous ASGR-expressing cells and were able to recapitulate hepatocyte ASO uptake and activity in cells engineered to heterologously express the receptor. We found that the minor receptor subunit, ASGR2, is not required for effective in vitro or in vivo uptake of GalNAc-conjugated ASO and that the major subunit, ASGR1, plays a small but significant role in the uptake of unconjugated phosphorothioate ASOs into hepatocytes. Moreover, our data demonstrates there is a large excess capacity of liver ASGR for the effective uptake of GalNAc\u2013ASO conjugates, suggesting broad opportunities to exploit receptors with relatively moderate levels of expression."

                            "Endogenous targeting is a special passive targeting, which mainly means that NPs will combine with different biomolecules in systemic circulation, to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\", especially with protein in blood to form a \"protein corona, \" which can be transported to target organs or cells without targeting ligands (Cifuentes\u2010Rius et al., 2020)",
                            "The adsorption process of protein coronas is known to be difficult to control, and protein coronas can even mask the targeting ligands, leading to loss of targeting efficacy. Based on these results, the protein corona is considered an \"enemy\" in NPs targeting strategies, necessitating resistance to protein corona adsorption in vivo. However, emerging evidence shows that some specific protein coronas in the blood can improve mRNA NP delivery to specific tissues [91]. For example, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with liver-specific delivery of NPs.\n\nBesides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs. LNPs with DOPE preferentially accumulate in the liver, and the interaction between LNPs with DOPE and ApoE was stronger than that with DSPC [118]. Protein coronas other than ApoE can be formed by modifying the lipid chemistry of LNPs. As a result, LNPs can enter hepatocytes through other endocytosis routes besides CME. Miao et al. [107] demonstrated that by incorporating alkyne and ester groups into cKK-E12-LNPs, serum albumin gets attached LNP surface instead of ApoE surface, and LNPs entered hepatocytes through CvME and micropinocytosis.\n\nFor liver diseases, mRNA-LNPs can be delivered to hepatocytes by endogenous targeting. In a mouse model of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, Yang et al. [14] found that the ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting was not significantly affected. They synthesized LNPs containing ALC-0315, DSCP, cholesterol, and ALC-0159, and the LNPs successfully delivered HNF4A mRNA to hepatocytes through ApoE action. However, under specific pathological conditions, such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), the LDLRs almost disappeared, seriously affecting the ApoE-based endogenous targeting [119]."

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in (Dilliard et al., 2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2022)."

Therefore, exploring a lymphoid-organ\u2013specific mRNA vaccine could be a promising strategy for developing next-generation mRNA vaccines. Herein, we reported a lymph-node\u2013targeting mRNA vaccine based on lipid nanoparticles named 113-O12B for cancer immunotherapy. The targeted delivery of the mRNA vaccine elicits robust CD8+ T cell responses, exhibiting excellent protective and therapeutic effects on B16F10 melanoma. Notably, 113-O12B can efficiently deliver both a full-length protein and a short-peptide\u2013based, antigens-encoded mRNA, thus providing a universal platform for mRNA vaccines."

Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. (80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81)."

                            "Significance The current application of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based technology has largely been confined to liver diseases because of the lack of a specific and efficient extrahepatic in vivo systemic mRNA delivery system. Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM."

The results from these early clinical trials suggest that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and the novel ionizable lipids that comprise them, will be important materials in this emerging field of medicine. A persistent theme in the use of materials for biomedical applications has been the incorporation of biodegradability as a means to improve biocompatibility and/or to facilitate elimination. Therefore, the aim of this work was to further advance the LNP platform through the development of novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. As a representative example of this novel class of biodegradable lipids, the lipid evaluated in this work displays rapid elimination from plasma and tissues, substantially improved tolerability in preclinical studies, while maintaining in vivo potency on par with that of the most advanced lipids currently available."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.
