The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.",

                    "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

                    "text": "By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11 With cost savings of roughly 35% for annual production demand between 100 and 500 kg, continuous processing achieves the highest cell densities (50-100\u00d710 6 cells/mL vs 15-25\u00d710 6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day vs 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) as shown in Table 1. \n\nThe advantages of certain fermentation techniques in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are rather well supported by recent studies. A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation. With an ideal dilution rate of 0.015 h-1, their studies found that continuous culture essentially reduced substrate inhibitory effects and preserved the organism in a stronger adaptive condition. Though they remain vulnerable to contamination difficulties, Yi 14 pointed out that continuous fermentation systems run free through constant or occasional injection of fresh nutrient medium without any limits. These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.",

Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11\n...\nBy means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11 With cost savings of roughly 35% for annual production demand between 100 and 500 kg, continuous processing achieves the highest cell densities (50-100\u00d710 6 cells/mL vs 15-25\u00d710 6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day vs 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) as shown in Table 1. \n\nThe advantages of certain fermentation techniques in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are rather well supported by recent studies. A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation. With an ideal dilution rate of 0.015 h-1, their studies found that continuous culture essentially reduced substrate inhibitory effects and preserved the organism in a stronger adaptive condition. Though they remain vulnerable to contamination difficulties, Yi 14 pointed out that continuous fermentation systems run free through constant or occasional injection of fresh nutrient medium without any limits. These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.\n...\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.

Success in this evolving landscape will require continued innovation in process design, optimization strategies, and implementation approaches. As highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan, 27,44 the integration of deep learning and other advanced technologies offers promising pathways for future developments in protein expression optimization and process control. \n\nThe future of mAb manufacturing lies in the successful integration of these elements, creating more efficient, flexible, and reliable production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. Continued R&D in these areas will be crucial for meeting the growing global demand for mAb therapeutics while ensuring their economic viability and accessibility.",

Several expression platforms have been employed for the production of these recombinant proteins, from which E. coli and CHO cell-based systems have emerged as the most promising hosts for higher expression. Because antibody fragments such as Fabs and scFvs are smaller than traditional antibody structures and do not require specific patterns of glycosylation decoration for therapeutic efficacy, it is possible to express them in systems with reduced post-translational modification capacity and high expression yield, for example, in plant and insect cell-based systems. In this review, we describe different bioengineering technologies along with their opportunities and difficulties to manufacture antibody fragments with consideration of stability, efficacy and safety for humans. There is still potential for a new production technology with a view of being simple, fast and cost-effective while maintaining the stability and efficacy of biotherapeutic fragments.",

Grabowska, Hamid Heidari Kashkoli, Reihaneh Mirhassani, David B. Guiliano, C. Dolphin, H. Khalili\n## Abstract\nAntibody fragments are used in the clinic as important therapeutic proteins for treatment of indications where better tissue penetration and less immunogenic molecules are needed. Several expression platforms have been employed for the production of these recombinant proteins, from which E. coli and CHO cell-based systems have emerged as the most promising hosts for higher expression. Because antibody fragments such as Fabs and scFvs are smaller than traditional antibody structures and do not require specific patterns of glycosylation decoration for therapeutic efficacy, it is possible to express them in systems with reduced post-translational modification capacity and high expression yield, for example, in plant and insect cell-based systems. In this review, we describe different bioengineering technologies along with their opportunities and difficulties to manufacture antibody fragments with consideration of stability, efficacy and safety for humans. There is still potential for a new production technology with a view of being simple, fast and cost-effective while maintaining the stability and efficacy of biotherapeutic fragments.\n## Technologies to Bioengineer the Antibody Fragments (Fabs and scFvs)\nWhile antibody fragments can be produced using enzymatic digestion of monoclonal antibodies, they can also be manufactured using recombinant heterologous protein expression systems.Host platforms such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, mammalian cells or even whole animals and plants have been successfully employed.While some of the biotherapeutics were originally extracted from human tissue and in relatively small amounts, the vast majority of therapeutic biologics on the market today are recombinant proteins, generated using reliable and consistent cell-based production platforms.Using recombinant DNA technologies, large amount of highly purified biologics can be produced, but challenges with the purity and quality still exist.In the following section, different bioengineering technologies are discussed, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages for production of antibody fragments.\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities of Different Expression Systems to Produce Antibody Fragments/Future Perspective\nMonoclonal antibodies and their fragments have emerged as a major class of therapeutic agents with broad clinical applications.Technologies to manufacture antibodies have had a continuous evolution over the past 50 years but there is still a need for new technologies to address challenges in selectivity, stability, higher efficacy, reduced immunogenicity and side effects in humans.Costs of production is another key element toward a new technology because it would impact therapy expenses, which in turn has a huge pharmaco-economic burden for both patients and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWhile antibody engineering began with hybridoma technology, this method has suffered from low-yielding efficiency, cost and animal immunization, leading to the antibody sequence originated from an animal with potential possibility to trigger human immune response.Beyond hybridoma, other technologies emerged to produce \"human-like\" biotherapeutics, such as phage display, but their utility has been limited due to the complexity of phage library preparation.Recombinant DNA methods have been a very successful technology for production of antibody fragments, but the selection of an efficient expression systems can be challenging.\n\nFigure 2 summarizes the challenges and opportunities that are associated with different expression platforms in regards to antibody fragment production.Expression systems are categorized into four main systems: bacterial, mammalian, plants and viral (insect cells).Bacteria expression systems are low cost capable of producing a high yield of the majority of simple proteins and peptides that are not glycosylated.Because the recombinant vector may be injected directly into the bacterial host without virus contamination by humans and bacteria, there is no requirement for any additional stage of viral eradication.Bacteria on the other hand are unable to perform posttranslational protein modifications, such as glycosylation, g-carboxylation, phosphorylation and sulfitation [127].Proteins that are inactive but have the correct molecular structure can also be produced by bacteria, which can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies.In addition, bacteria are capable of removing signal peptides, but they are unable to degrade preproteins, such as native coagulation growth factors [127].Endotoxins, which are produced by bacteria during the expression, are notoriously difficult to eradicate and make the purification process difficult.",

In this article, we describe the development of a large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor) for mammalian cell culture that works at laminar flow and perfusion conditions. The 184 cm2 32 cisterns LM bioreactor is the largest polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device fabricated by photopolymer flexographic master mold methodology, reaching a final volume of 2.8 mL. The LM bioreactor was connected to a syringe pump system for culture media perfusion, and the cells\u2019 culture was monitored by photomicrograph imaging. CHO-ahIFN-\u03b12b adherent cell line expressing the anti-hIFN-a2b recombinant scFv-Fc monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus were cultured on the LM bioreactor. Cell culture and mAb production in the LM bioreactor could be sustained for 18 days. Moreover, the anti-hIFN-a2b produced in the LM bioreactor showed higher affinity and neutralizing antiproliferative activity compared to those mAbs produced in the control condition. We demonstrate for the first-time, a large area microfluidic bioreactor for mammalian cell culture that enables a controlled microenvironment suitable for the development of high-quality biologics with potential for therapeutic use.",

                    "text": "The fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode [19][20][21]. The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls [19,21,22]. Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices [23]. \n\nThere are few studies on the use of LOC-type devices to produce recombinant proteins [24]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the production of an anti-hIFN-\u03b12b recombinant mAb with Chinese hamster ovary, CHO, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells in standard-size microfluidic devices with a final volume of 32.22 \u00b5L [25]. It was possible to increase the concentration of the antibodies up to 7.3 times higher (1120 pg of mAb per cell) than that obtained by standard culture methodologies (using T-flasks). Moreover, the functional activity of the antibodies produced in the microdevice (neutralization of the cellular cytokine signaling) did not present a significant difference from those obtained in the control culture. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to scale up the production of recombinant proteins in the large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor). To achieve that, we developed the LM bioreactor with a novel fabrication technique [26] and we validated the technology by producing and characterizing mAbs.",

Attallah, Daniel Chamorro, M. Oggero, R. Booth, S. Ferrero, S. Bhansali, Maximiliano S. Perez, B. Lerner, G. Helguera\n## Abstract\nTo produce innovative biopharmaceuticals, highly flexible, adaptable, robust, and affordable bioprocess platforms for bioreactors are essential. In this article, we describe the development of a large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor) for mammalian cell culture that works at laminar flow and perfusion conditions. The 184 cm2 32 cisterns LM bioreactor is the largest polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device fabricated by photopolymer flexographic master mold methodology, reaching a final volume of 2.8 mL. The LM bioreactor was connected to a syringe pump system for culture media perfusion, and the cells\u2019 culture was monitored by photomicrograph imaging. CHO-ahIFN-\u03b12b adherent cell line expressing the anti-hIFN-a2b recombinant scFv-Fc monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus were cultured on the LM bioreactor. Cell culture and mAb production in the LM bioreactor could be sustained for 18 days. Moreover, the anti-hIFN-a2b produced in the LM bioreactor showed higher affinity and neutralizing antiproliferative activity compared to those mAbs produced in the control condition. We demonstrate for the first-time, a large area microfluidic bioreactor for mammalian cell culture that enables a controlled microenvironment suitable for the development of high-quality biologics with potential for therapeutic use.\n## Introduction\nThe fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode [19][20][21]. The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls [19,21,22]. Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices [23]. \n\nThere are few studies on the use of LOC-type devices to produce recombinant proteins [24]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the production of an anti-hIFN-\u03b12b recombinant mAb with Chinese hamster ovary, CHO, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells in standard-size microfluidic devices with a final volume of 32.22 \u00b5L [25]. It was possible to increase the concentration of the antibodies up to 7.3 times higher (1120 pg of mAb per cell) than that obtained by standard culture methodologies (using T-flasks). Moreover, the functional activity of the antibodies produced in the microdevice (neutralization of the cellular cytokine signaling) did not present a significant difference from those obtained in the control culture. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to scale up the production of recombinant proteins in the large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor). To achieve that, we developed the LM bioreactor with a novel fabrication technique [26] and we validated the technology by producing and characterizing mAbs.",

In the case of \u201csmall molecule\u201d drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the \u201cdrug\u201d may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination.

These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

Tomaszewski, Sheryl Ruppel, S. Creekmore, E. Sausville\n## Abstract\nPreclinical therapeutics development research is directed toward fulfilling two overlapping sets of goals. A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development. The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects. In the case of \u201csmall molecule\u201d drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the \u201cdrug\u201d may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination. Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage. How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.\n## Purity\nPurification strategies depend on the nature of the biologic agent and expected impurities. These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

As a consequence, a variety of production processes have been established within the biomanufacturing industry. However, the rapidly increasing demand for therapeutic molecules amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that there still is a clear need to establish novel, highly productive, and flexible production processes. Within this work, we designed a novel discontinuous process by combining two intensification strategies, thus increasing inoculation density and media exchange via a fluidized bed centrifuge, to fulfill the need for a flexible and highly productive production process for therapeutic molecules. To establish this new process, firstly, a small-scale experiment was conducted to verify synergies between both intensification strategies, followed by a process transfer towards the proof-of-concept scale. The combination of these two-process intensification measures revealed overall synergies resulting in decreased process duration (\u221237%) and strongly enhanced product formation (+116%) in comparison to the not-intensified standard operation. This led to an impressive threefold increase in space-time yield, while only negligible differences in product quality could be observed. Overall, this novel process not only increases the ways to react to emergency situations thanks to its flexibility and possible short development times, but also represents a possible alternative to the current established processes due to high increases in productivity, in comparison to standard fed-batch operations.",

Saballus, Markus Kampmann, Ren\u00e9 H. Wijffels, Dirk E. Martens, Julia Niemann\n## Abstract\nMonoclonal antibodies are the workhorse of the pharmaceutical industry due to their potential to treat a variety of different diseases while providing high specificity and efficiency. As a consequence, a variety of production processes have been established within the biomanufacturing industry. However, the rapidly increasing demand for therapeutic molecules amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that there still is a clear need to establish novel, highly productive, and flexible production processes. Within this work, we designed a novel discontinuous process by combining two intensification strategies, thus increasing inoculation density and media exchange via a fluidized bed centrifuge, to fulfill the need for a flexible and highly productive production process for therapeutic molecules. To establish this new process, firstly, a small-scale experiment was conducted to verify synergies between both intensification strategies, followed by a process transfer towards the proof-of-concept scale. The combination of these two-process intensification measures revealed overall synergies resulting in decreased process duration (\u221237%) and strongly enhanced product formation (+116%) in comparison to the not-intensified standard operation. This led to an impressive threefold increase in space-time yield, while only negligible differences in product quality could be observed. Overall, this novel process not only increases the ways to react to emergency situations thanks to its flexibility and possible short development times, but also represents a possible alternative to the current established processes due to high increases in productivity, in comparison to standard fed-batch operations.\n## Introduction\nIn recent years, the biopharmaceutical industry has received much attention due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic [1]. A key factor in fighting the pandemic was the increased speed of development of novel vaccines and drug treatments against COVID-19 [2][3][4].

The process must also meet large commercial demand, while simultaneously being able to accommodate change without sacrificing product consistency. The four key components of successful biologics manufacturing are (1) a stable, well-defined proprietary cell line; (2) a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant supply chain with a process control strategy defining acceptable levels of variability for target product/process attributes and capable of managing complex material flows; (3) a tightly controlled procedure for implementation of proposed process changes that ensures product consistency; and (4) built-in redundancy and flexibility providing the ability to adapt rapidly to unexpected developments. This report describes the requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of biologics, using Remicade\u00ae (infliximab, Janssen Biotech, Horsham, PA, USA) as an example of best practices. Since Remicade\u2019s first marketing approval in 1998, Janssen has manufactured\u2009>\u2009150 million vials used to treat\u2009>\u20092.6 million patients around the world for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Remicade displays a highly consistent quality attribute profile and meets all product/process specifications across multiple manufacturing sites and process scales. Janssen\u2019s experience with Remicade demonstrates that deep product knowledge, extensive manufacturing experience, diligent product/process monitoring and a sustained commitment to compliance and research are required to ensure quality, consistency and uninterrupted patient supply for large-volume biologics over the long term.",

                    "text": "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

Melsheimer, M. Calmann, Albert DeRitis, Vinod Philip, Frank Van Gog, Lawrence Doolittle, K. Goyal, Donald Neblock\n## Abstract\nBiologics are produced from living organisms in complex, multi-stage manufacturing processes and contain inherent variability, which must be understood and controlled during manufacturing to avoid unexpected changes in key quality attributes that may contribute to clinically meaningful differences. The process must also meet large commercial demand, while simultaneously being able to accommodate change without sacrificing product consistency. The four key components of successful biologics manufacturing are (1) a stable, well-defined proprietary cell line; (2) a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant supply chain with a process control strategy defining acceptable levels of variability for target product/process attributes and capable of managing complex material flows; (3) a tightly controlled procedure for implementation of proposed process changes that ensures product consistency; and (4) built-in redundancy and flexibility providing the ability to adapt rapidly to unexpected developments. This report describes the requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of biologics, using Remicade\u00ae (infliximab, Janssen Biotech, Horsham, PA, USA) as an example of best practices. Since Remicade\u2019s first marketing approval in 1998, Janssen has manufactured\u2009>\u2009150 million vials used to treat\u2009>\u20092.6 million patients around the world for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Remicade displays a highly consistent quality attribute profile and meets all product/process specifications across multiple manufacturing sites and process scales. Janssen\u2019s experience with Remicade demonstrates that deep product knowledge, extensive manufacturing experience, diligent product/process monitoring and a sustained commitment to compliance and research are required to ensure quality, consistency and uninterrupted patient supply for large-volume biologics over the long term.\n## Introduction\noperations have been both expanded and updated [5], while simultaneously continuing to produce drug which meets quality specifications and market demand.\n\nIn this summary, we review the challenges associated with manufacturing large-volume biologics and the measures needed to ensure high-quality, long-term consistency and adequate supply by presentation of the example of one of the most widely used biologics today, Remicade.\n\n## The Challenges to Production and Distribution of a Large-Volume Biologic: Understanding and Controlling Variability\nIn contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

The answer to such an increasing need has been the development of a wide array of formats and alternative production platforms. This review offers a critical comparison and evaluation of the different options to help the researchers interested in expressing recombinant antibodies in their choice.ResultsRather than the compilation of an exhaustive list of the recent publications in the field, this review intendeds to analyze the development of the most innovative or fast-growing strategies. These have been illustrated with some significant examples and, when possible, compared with the existing alternatives. Space has also been given to those solutions that might represent interesting opportunities or that investigate critical aspects of the production optimization but for which the available data as yet do not allow for a definitive judgment.ConclusionsThe take-home message is that there is a clear process of progressive diversification concerning the antibody expression platforms and an effort to yield directly application-adapted immune-reagents rather than generic naked antibodies that need further in vitro modification steps before becoming usable.",

The complexity of bsAbs creates challenges in employing effective evaluation methods to detect developability risks in early discovery stage, and poses difficulties in identifying the root causes and implementing subsequent engineering solutions. This study presents a case of engineering a bsAb that displayed a normal solution appearance during the discovery phase but underwent significant precipitation when subjected to agitation stress during 15 L Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) production Leveraging analytical tools, structural analysis, in silico prediction, and wet-lab validations, the key molecular origins responsible for the observed precipitation were identified and addressed. Sequence engineering to reduce protein surface hydrophobicity and enhance conformational stability proved effective in resolving agitation-induced aggregation. The refined bsAb sequences enabled successful mass production in CMC department. The findings of this case study contribute to the understanding of the fundamental mechanism of agitation-induced aggregation and offer a potential protein engineering procedure for addressing similar issues in bsAb. Furthermore, this case study emphasizes the significance of a close partnership between Discovery and CMC teams. Integrating CMC\u2019s rigorous evaluation methods with Discovery\u2019s engineering capability can facilitate a streamlined development process for bsAb molecules.",

                    "text": "Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have gained significant attention in the biopharmaceutical field due to their capability to target two different targets or two epitopes on one antigen, potentially enabling the design of novel therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoA) and enhancing efficacy [1]. BsAbs achieve their specific functions due to their unique molecular structure. However, this necessitates meticulous design and development to guarantee both their efficacy and manufacturability [2,3]. \n\nManufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, [4] which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible [5,6]. Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial [7,8]. \n\nAs one of the most common manufacturability issues, antibody aggregation is highly undesirable. It may complicate the production process, impair biological activity, and increase the risk of immunogenicity [9][10][11][12]. Antibody aggregation could be mitigated through diverse approaches, including the development of purification process [13,14], and formulation optimization [15][16][17]. However, significant antibody aggregation that leads to product precipitation during downstream production will likely require sequence engineering [10,18,19]. The effectiveness of sequence engineering heavily relies on the fundamental understanding of aggregation mechanism at molecular level, mainly involving colloidal stability and conformational stability [20,21].",

The complexity of bsAbs creates challenges in employing effective evaluation methods to detect developability risks in early discovery stage, and poses difficulties in identifying the root causes and implementing subsequent engineering solutions. This study presents a case of engineering a bsAb that displayed a normal solution appearance during the discovery phase but underwent significant precipitation when subjected to agitation stress during 15 L Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) production Leveraging analytical tools, structural analysis, in silico prediction, and wet-lab validations, the key molecular origins responsible for the observed precipitation were identified and addressed. Sequence engineering to reduce protein surface hydrophobicity and enhance conformational stability proved effective in resolving agitation-induced aggregation. The refined bsAb sequences enabled successful mass production in CMC department. The findings of this case study contribute to the understanding of the fundamental mechanism of agitation-induced aggregation and offer a potential protein engineering procedure for addressing similar issues in bsAb. Furthermore, this case study emphasizes the significance of a close partnership between Discovery and CMC teams. Integrating CMC\u2019s rigorous evaluation methods with Discovery\u2019s engineering capability can facilitate a streamlined development process for bsAb molecules.\n## Introduction\nBispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have gained significant attention in the biopharmaceutical field due to their capability to target two different targets or two epitopes on one antigen, potentially enabling the design of novel therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoA) and enhancing efficacy [1]. BsAbs achieve their specific functions due to their unique molecular structure. However, this necessitates meticulous design and development to guarantee both their efficacy and manufacturability [2,3]. \n\nManufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, [4] which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible [5,6]. Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial [7,8]. \n\nAs one of the most common manufacturability issues, antibody aggregation is highly undesirable. It may complicate the production process, impair biological activity, and increase the risk of immunogenicity [9][10][11][12]. Antibody aggregation could be mitigated through diverse approaches, including the development of purification process [13,14], and formulation optimization [15][16][17]. However, significant antibody aggregation that leads to product precipitation during downstream production will likely require sequence engineering [10,18,19]. The effectiveness of sequence engineering heavily relies on the fundamental understanding of aggregation mechanism at molecular level, mainly involving colloidal stability and conformational stability [20,21].",

The success of this transition will require the development of genetically stable production strains, the use of strong constitutive promoters, and the development of new medium formulations that allow an appropriate balance between cell growth and product formation. We identified genes that showed high expression in Komagataella phaffii during different steady\u2010state conditions and explored the utility of promoters of these genes (Chr1\u20134_0586 and FragB_0052) in optimizing the expression of two different r\u2010proteins, human lysozyme (HuLy), and the anti\u2010idiotypic antibody fragment, Fab\u20103H6, in comparison with the widely used glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Our results showed that the promoter strength was highly dependent on the cultivation conditions and thus constructs should be tested under a range of conditions to determine both the best performing clone and the ideal promoter for the expression of the protein of interest. An important benefit of continuous production is that it facilitates the use of the genome\u2010scale metabolic models in the design of strains and cultivation media. In silico flux distributions showed that production of either protein increased the flux through aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Tyrosine supplementation increased the productivity for both proteins, whereas tryptophan addition did not cause any significant change and, phenylalanine addition increased the expression of HuLy but decreased that of Fab\u20103H6. These results showed that a genome\u2010scale metabolic model can be used to assess the metabolic burden imposed by the synthesis of a specific r\u2010protein and then this information can be used to tailor a cultivation medium to increase production.",

                    "text": "Recombinant protein production is now a multibillion-dollar market, and about 25% of commercial pharmaceuticals are biopharmaceuticals (Weinacker et al., 2013). The ever-increasing demand for therapeutic antibodies may force many companies to change from batch processing to continuous production, because traditional fed-batch manufacturing cannot generate the huge quantities of r-proteins required without huge capital investments in a new plant (Warikoo et al., 2012). In addition to increasing demand, the desire for reduced processing costs and requirements for consistent quality and higher productivity are among the key drivers for this transition from batch to continuous in the biotechnology industry (Rathore, Agarwal, Sharma, Pathak, & Muthukumar, 2015). \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous processing requires the implementation of quality-by-design principles and new product development processes (Hernandez, 2015). On the other hand, short process development times, low tolerance to risk, and cost control under stringent quality/regulatory requirements make the implementation of new technologies a challenge for the biotechnology companies (Rathore et al., 2015). Thus, the development of new approaches and techniques that will reduce the risk and time required for upstream process development and optimization is essential. For a continuous process, an important consideration during the development of novel cell lines and growth media should be to generate stable and robust processes that are able to maintain high productivity over a considerable period of continuous operation. \n\nThe choice of a vehicle organism for r-protein production is often determined by the nature of the recombinant product, with mammalian systems being preferred for the production of large, glycosylated proteins, and microbial cells for smaller unmodified proteins. Recent advances in the humanization of the microbial pathways for protein glycosylation and the burgeoning demand for continuous processes make microbial eukaryotes and particularly yeasts increasingly attractive vehicles for the production of complex human proteins (Maccani et al., 2014). Among the yeasts, Komagataella phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) has been the species most often used for the production of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes.",

The success of this transition will require the development of genetically stable production strains, the use of strong constitutive promoters, and the development of new medium formulations that allow an appropriate balance between cell growth and product formation. We identified genes that showed high expression in Komagataella phaffii during different steady\u2010state conditions and explored the utility of promoters of these genes (Chr1\u20134_0586 and FragB_0052) in optimizing the expression of two different r\u2010proteins, human lysozyme (HuLy), and the anti\u2010idiotypic antibody fragment, Fab\u20103H6, in comparison with the widely used glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Our results showed that the promoter strength was highly dependent on the cultivation conditions and thus constructs should be tested under a range of conditions to determine both the best performing clone and the ideal promoter for the expression of the protein of interest. An important benefit of continuous production is that it facilitates the use of the genome\u2010scale metabolic models in the design of strains and cultivation media. In silico flux distributions showed that production of either protein increased the flux through aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Tyrosine supplementation increased the productivity for both proteins, whereas tryptophan addition did not cause any significant change and, phenylalanine addition increased the expression of HuLy but decreased that of Fab\u20103H6. These results showed that a genome\u2010scale metabolic model can be used to assess the metabolic burden imposed by the synthesis of a specific r\u2010protein and then this information can be used to tailor a cultivation medium to increase production.\n## | INTRODUCTION\nRecombinant protein production is now a multibillion-dollar market, and about 25% of commercial pharmaceuticals are biopharmaceuticals (Weinacker et al., 2013). The ever-increasing demand for therapeutic antibodies may force many companies to change from batch processing to continuous production, because traditional fed-batch manufacturing cannot generate the huge quantities of r-proteins required without huge capital investments in a new plant (Warikoo et al., 2012). In addition to increasing demand, the desire for reduced processing costs and requirements for consistent quality and higher productivity are among the key drivers for this transition from batch to continuous in the biotechnology industry (Rathore, Agarwal, Sharma, Pathak, & Muthukumar, 2015). \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous processing requires the implementation of quality-by-design principles and new product development processes (Hernandez, 2015). On the other hand, short process development times, low tolerance to risk, and cost control under stringent quality/regulatory requirements make the implementation of new technologies a challenge for the biotechnology companies (Rathore et al., 2015). Thus, the development of new approaches and techniques that will reduce the risk and time required for upstream process development and optimization is essential. For a continuous process, an important consideration during the development of novel cell lines and growth media should be to generate stable and robust processes that are able to maintain high productivity over a considerable period of continuous operation. \n\nThe choice of a vehicle organism for r-protein production is often determined by the nature of the recombinant product, with mammalian systems being preferred for the production of large, glycosylated proteins, and microbial cells for smaller unmodified proteins. Recent advances in the humanization of the microbial pathways for protein glycosylation and the burgeoning demand for continuous processes make microbial eukaryotes and particularly yeasts increasingly attractive vehicles for the production of complex human proteins (Maccani et al., 2014). Among the yeasts, Komagataella phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) has been the species most often used for the production of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes.",

This work describes an intensification approach, which connects a tangential-flow-filtration (TFF) based pre-stage perfusion process with a concentrated fed-batch production culture inoculated with an ultra-high seeding density (uHSD). This strategy shifted biomass production towards the pre-stage, reaching up to 45\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 \u00a0cells/mL in perfusion mode. Subsequently, production in the intensified fed-batch started immediately and the product titer was almost doubled (1.9-fold) in an equivalent runtime and with comparable product quality compared to low-seeded cultures. Driven by mechanistic modelling and next-generation sequencing (NGS) the process had been optimized by selecting the media composition in a way that minimized cellular adaptation between perfusion and production culture. As a main feature, lactate feeding was applied in the intensified approach to promote cell culture performance and process scalability was proven via transfer to pilot-scale i.e., 20\u00a0L pre-stage perfusion and 80\u00a0L production reactor. Moreover, an earlier shift from a growth associated to a production stage associated gene expression pattern was identified for uHSD cultures compared to the reference. Overall, we showed that the described intensification strategy yielded in a higher volumetric productivity and is applicable for existing or already approved molecules in common, commercial fed-batch facilities. This work provides an in-depth molecular understanding of cellular processes that are detrimental during process intensification.",

Typical process formats comprise mammalian expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultivated in fed-batch processes with final production scales of several cubic meters [3]. Increasing market demands for monoclonal antibody therapeutics and the pressure for cost-reduction in their production [4,5] have led to new manufacturing approaches and improved facility utilization strategies e.g., continuous production [6,7]. For implementation of upcoming process intensification technologies, pharmaceutical companies can aim for scale out by building additional manufacturing capacities or for intensification in existing pharmaceutical production plants. Both strategies require substantial investments and the changes have to be balanced against cost and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment. In the case of fully continuous production processes, an implementation in existing fed-batch facilities is often impossible due to open technical and regulatory questions such as higher complexity and increased media amounts [7][8][9]. A smart step for the development and maintenance of marketable antibody portfolios is to search for intensification strategies, which debottleneck production chains using available capacities whenever possible and which are implementable in existing facilities, such as N \u2212 1 perfusion [10]. \n\nThe concept of pre-stage (N \u2212 1) perfusion shifts biomass production away from capital-intensive large-scale reactors into the smaller pre-stage systems, as described by Kloth et al. [10]. Cell retention combined with media exchange facilitates robust exponential cell proliferation without any loss of biomass and can be achieved by a number of technologies, which differ in robustness and scalability [11]. Perfusion processes have the potential to reach over 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL [12], so that the required biomass generation of several sequential batch pre-stages can be combined into one perfusion stage. Consequently, the number and size of seed bioreactors could be reduced shortening overall process timelines.",

Voges\n## Abstract\nProcess intensification strategies are needed in the field of therapeutic protein production for higher productivities, lower cost of goods and improved facility utilization. This work describes an intensification approach, which connects a tangential-flow-filtration (TFF) based pre-stage perfusion process with a concentrated fed-batch production culture inoculated with an ultra-high seeding density (uHSD). This strategy shifted biomass production towards the pre-stage, reaching up to 45\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 \u00a0cells/mL in perfusion mode. Subsequently, production in the intensified fed-batch started immediately and the product titer was almost doubled (1.9-fold) in an equivalent runtime and with comparable product quality compared to low-seeded cultures. Driven by mechanistic modelling and next-generation sequencing (NGS) the process had been optimized by selecting the media composition in a way that minimized cellular adaptation between perfusion and production culture. As a main feature, lactate feeding was applied in the intensified approach to promote cell culture performance and process scalability was proven via transfer to pilot-scale i.e., 20\u00a0L pre-stage perfusion and 80\u00a0L production reactor. Moreover, an earlier shift from a growth associated to a production stage associated gene expression pattern was identified for uHSD cultures compared to the reference. Overall, we showed that the described intensification strategy yielded in a higher volumetric productivity and is applicable for existing or already approved molecules in common, commercial fed-batch facilities. This work provides an in-depth molecular understanding of cellular processes that are detrimental during process intensification.\n## Introduction\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other derived therapeutic proteins are currently one of the most important product classes in the pharmaceutical industry and will likely remain relevant for many years to come [1,2]. Typical process formats comprise mammalian expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultivated in fed-batch processes with final production scales of several cubic meters [3]. Increasing market demands for monoclonal antibody therapeutics and the pressure for cost-reduction in their production [4,5] have led to new manufacturing approaches and improved facility utilization strategies e.g., continuous production [6,7]. For implementation of upcoming process intensification technologies, pharmaceutical companies can aim for scale out by building additional manufacturing capacities or for intensification in existing pharmaceutical production plants. Both strategies require substantial investments and the changes have to be balanced against cost and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment. In the case of fully continuous production processes, an implementation in existing fed-batch facilities is often impossible due to open technical and regulatory questions such as higher complexity and increased media amounts [7][8][9]. A smart step for the development and maintenance of marketable antibody portfolios is to search for intensification strategies, which debottleneck production chains using available capacities whenever possible and which are implementable in existing facilities, such as N \u2212 1 perfusion [10]. \n\nThe concept of pre-stage (N \u2212 1) perfusion shifts biomass production away from capital-intensive large-scale reactors into the smaller pre-stage systems, as described by Kloth et al. [10]. Cell retention combined with media exchange facilitates robust exponential cell proliferation without any loss of biomass and can be achieved by a number of technologies, which differ in robustness and scalability [11]. Perfusion processes have the potential to reach over 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL [12], so that the required biomass generation of several sequential batch pre-stages can be combined into one perfusion stage. Consequently, the number and size of seed bioreactors could be reduced shortening overall process timelines.",

However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins. However, current mammalian cell proliferation control methods rely on temperature shifts and chemical agents, which interact with many non-proliferation pathways, leading to variable impacts on product quality and culture viability. Synthetic biology offers an alternative approach by strategically targeting proliferation pathways to arrest cell growth but have largely remained unused in industrial bioproduction. Due to recent developments in microbial decoupling systems and advances in available mammalian cell engineering tools, we propose that the synthetic biology approach to decoupling growth and production needs revisiting.",

                    "text": "Industrial-scale production of many biotherapeutics relies on the culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In fed-batch cultures, nutrients are added to the culture to prevent nutrient limitation, prolong culture duration, and maximize product titer. Once culture viability drops below a certain threshold, the culture is harvested and the product is purified. Advances in cell engineering, expression vector design, and process development have allowed monoclonal antibody (mAb) titers to reach 10 g/L. However, high expression of recombinant genes places a large metabolic burden on the cell, which can result in the downregulation of recombinant gene expression. To avoid unstable cell lines entering the manufacturing stage, stability studies (which remain a significant bottleneck in cell line development timelines) are performed to identify cell lines that maintain high gene expression over the culture period. Additionally, a growing range of next-generation biotherapeutics (such as bi-specific antibodies, fusion proteins, and toxic proteins) are being produced as a result of recent developments in protein engineering. These are often difficult to express in CHO cells at desired quantities. For example, production of hyperactive human DNase I is particularly challenging with standard culture processes, because protein expression negatively impacts cell growth, viability, and stability (Lam et al., 2017). \n\nAn increasingly attractive method of production is to decouple the growth and production phases of the culture process, usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy (Misaghi et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2017;Poulain et al., 2017). Under such a system, cells are initially grown up to high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase). Once the desired cell density is reached, expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation is halted (the production phase). Proliferation is usually arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is associated with larger cells and increased ribosomal protein S6 levels (Carvalhal et al., 2003;Bi et al., 2004).",

Donaldson, M. P. Dale, S. Rosser\n## Abstract\nFed-batch cultures of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells have been used to produce high quantities of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies. However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins. However, current mammalian cell proliferation control methods rely on temperature shifts and chemical agents, which interact with many non-proliferation pathways, leading to variable impacts on product quality and culture viability. Synthetic biology offers an alternative approach by strategically targeting proliferation pathways to arrest cell growth but have largely remained unused in industrial bioproduction. Due to recent developments in microbial decoupling systems and advances in available mammalian cell engineering tools, we propose that the synthetic biology approach to decoupling growth and production needs revisiting.\n## INTRODUCTION\nIndustrial-scale production of many biotherapeutics relies on the culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In fed-batch cultures, nutrients are added to the culture to prevent nutrient limitation, prolong culture duration, and maximize product titer. Once culture viability drops below a certain threshold, the culture is harvested and the product is purified. Advances in cell engineering, expression vector design, and process development have allowed monoclonal antibody (mAb) titers to reach 10 g/L. However, high expression of recombinant genes places a large metabolic burden on the cell, which can result in the downregulation of recombinant gene expression. To avoid unstable cell lines entering the manufacturing stage, stability studies (which remain a significant bottleneck in cell line development timelines) are performed to identify cell lines that maintain high gene expression over the culture period. Additionally, a growing range of next-generation biotherapeutics (such as bi-specific antibodies, fusion proteins, and toxic proteins) are being produced as a result of recent developments in protein engineering. These are often difficult to express in CHO cells at desired quantities. For example, production of hyperactive human DNase I is particularly challenging with standard culture processes, because protein expression negatively impacts cell growth, viability, and stability (Lam et al., 2017). \n\nAn increasingly attractive method of production is to decouple the growth and production phases of the culture process, usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy (Misaghi et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2017;Poulain et al., 2017). Under such a system, cells are initially grown up to high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase). Once the desired cell density is reached, expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation is halted (the production phase). Proliferation is usually arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is associated with larger cells and increased ribosomal protein S6 levels (Carvalhal et al., 2003;Bi et al., 2004).",

The novel process showed increased productivity (+217%) as well as longer cultivation duration, in comparison to a standard FB with a significantly lower media consumption per produced product (\u221250%) and a decreased need for process monitoring, in comparison to a perfusion cultivation. Further, the process revealed constant glycosylation pattern in comparison to the perfusion cultivation and has strong potential for further scale-up, due to the use of fully scalable cultivation and media exchange platforms. In summary, we have developed a novel hybrid process strategy that tackles the key challenges of current biomanufacturing of either low productivity or high media consumption, representing a new and innovative approach for future process intensification efforts.\n",

Antibody generation has been dramatically accelerated by in vitro selection systems, particularly phage display. An increasing variety of recombinant production systems have been developed, ranging from Gram-negative and positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines, mammalian cells to transgenic plants and animals. Currently, almost all therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity due to altered, non-human glycosylation patterns. However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with \u201chuman-like\u201d post-translational modifications. Furthermore, smaller antibody fragments including bispecific antibodies without any glycosylation are successfully produced in bacteria and have advanced to clinical testing. The first therapeutic antibody products from a non-mammalian source can be expected in coming next years. In this review, we focus on current antibody production systems including their usability for different applications.",

However, the advanced mammalian folding, secretion and post-translational apparatus is capable of producing antibodies indistinguishable from those in the human body with least concerns for immunogenic modifications. Moreover, it is also highly efficient for secretion of large and complex IgGs and in combination with the folding and post-translational control it results in high product quality which reduces efforts and costs in the subsequent and more expensive downstream processing steps. The risks of contamination by pathogens or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (TSE/BSE) agents have been eliminated by well-documented Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant designer cell substrates and chemical defined media without the need of supplementing animal serum components (145). In 2004, mammalian cell culture technology reached production levels of approximately 5 g/L IgGs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (146). Today, industrial IgG production levels often exceed 12 g/L as the result of a steadily ongoing progress in mammalian cell culture technology, which is mainly due to improved high producer cell lines, optimized production media, and prolonged production processes at high-cell densities. The highest reported IgG production titer we found was obtained in the human embryonic retinal cell line Per.C6 [Crucell, Leiden, Netherlands, (147)] with 27 g/L. Generally, the productivity of recombinant mammalian cell lines increased from initially 10 pg antibody per cell per day (pcd) in 1986 to about 90 pcd in 2004. Today, the antibody production levels only rarely exceed 100 pcd because higher cellular productivity usually corresponds to lower maximum cell densities in the production process. Producer cell lines have also been genetically engineered regarding product homogeneity, improved metabolism, reduced apoptosis, and inducible cell cycle arrest (148,149) which allows prolonged production times for almost 3 weeks at high-cell viability and cell densities. \n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most common cells applied in the commercial production of biopharmaceuticals.",

Schirrmann\n## Abstract\nRecombinant antibodies are highly specific detection probes in research, diagnostics, and have emerged over the last two decades as the fastest growing class of therapeutic proteins. Antibody generation has been dramatically accelerated by in vitro selection systems, particularly phage display. An increasing variety of recombinant production systems have been developed, ranging from Gram-negative and positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines, mammalian cells to transgenic plants and animals. Currently, almost all therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity due to altered, non-human glycosylation patterns. However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with \u201chuman-like\u201d post-translational modifications. Furthermore, smaller antibody fragments including bispecific antibodies without any glycosylation are successfully produced in bacteria and have advanced to clinical testing. The first therapeutic antibody products from a non-mammalian source can be expected in coming next years. In this review, we focus on current antibody production systems including their usability for different applications.\n## MAMMALIAN CELLS\nToday, 60-70% of all recombinant protein pharmaceuticals and 95% of the currently approved therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines despite relatively high production costs and difficult in handling. However, the advanced mammalian folding, secretion and post-translational apparatus is capable of producing antibodies indistinguishable from those in the human body with least concerns for immunogenic modifications. Moreover, it is also highly efficient for secretion of large and complex IgGs and in combination with the folding and post-translational control it results in high product quality which reduces efforts and costs in the subsequent and more expensive downstream processing steps. The risks of contamination by pathogens or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (TSE/BSE) agents have been eliminated by well-documented Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant designer cell substrates and chemical defined media without the need of supplementing animal serum components (145). In 2004, mammalian cell culture technology reached production levels of approximately 5 g/L IgGs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (146). Today, industrial IgG production levels often exceed 12 g/L as the result of a steadily ongoing progress in mammalian cell culture technology, which is mainly due to improved high producer cell lines, optimized production media, and prolonged production processes at high-cell densities. The highest reported IgG production titer we found was obtained in the human embryonic retinal cell line Per.C6 [Crucell, Leiden, Netherlands, (147)] with 27 g/L. Generally, the productivity of recombinant mammalian cell lines increased from initially 10 pg antibody per cell per day (pcd) in 1986 to about 90 pcd in 2004. Today, the antibody production levels only rarely exceed 100 pcd because higher cellular productivity usually corresponds to lower maximum cell densities in the production process. Producer cell lines have also been genetically engineered regarding product homogeneity, improved metabolism, reduced apoptosis, and inducible cell cycle arrest (148,149) which allows prolonged production times for almost 3 weeks at high-cell viability and cell densities. \n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most common cells applied in the commercial production of biopharmaceuticals.",

They facilitate the simultaneous execution of a wide variety of experimental conditions while minimizing potential process variability. Applications of this approach include: clone screening, temperature and pH shifts, media and supplement optimization. Furthermore, the small reactor volumes are conducive to large Design of Experiments that investigate a wide range of conditions. This allows upstream processes to be significantly optimized before scale-up where experimentation is more limited in scope due to time and economic constraints. Automated microscale bioreactor systems offer various advantages over traditional small scale cell culture units, such as shake flasks or spinner flasks. However, during pilot scale process development significant care must be taken to ensure that these advantages are realized. When run with care, the system can enable high level automation, can be programmed to run DOE's with a higher number of variables and can reduce sampling time when integrated with a nutrient analyzer or cell counter. Integration of the expert-derived heuristics presented here, with current automated microscale bioreactor experiments can minimize common pitfalls that hinder meaningful results. In the extreme, failure to adhere to the principles laid out here can lead to equipment damage that requires expensive repairs. Furthermore, the microbioreactor systems have small culture volumes making characterization of cell culture conditions difficult. The number and amount of samples taken in-process in batch mode culture is limited as operating volumes cannot fall below 10 mL. This method will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of microscale bioreactor systems.",

Since then, an increase in the development of recombinant protein production has taken place to humanize mAbs to increase in vivo safety and efficacy 2,3,4 . Most of the recombinant protein production processes employ Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the ease with which they can be adapted to serum free media, their ability to produce proteins with similar post-translational modifications to that of an innate human protein and their dependability as host cells 5,6 .\n\nDemand is growing to deliver product faster, and for larger patient populations with consistent quality. In addition to the economic benefits, the repertoire of diseases treated by mAbs is increasing, which now includes autoimmune diseases, post-transplantation complications, arthritis, and cancers 7 . Average yields for modern commercial mAb production lines are typically in the range of 5-6 g/L and continue to rise 5 . In part, this has been accomplished through CHO cell engineering and improved production line screening using high-throughput bioreactors 8 . However, most increases in protein production have been attributed to process improvements, including advancements in media optimization, cell culture conditions, and enhanced feeding strategies 7,9,10 . Nutrient supplementation is essential not only for proper cell growth but also for efficient production of high quality protein. Furthermore, cells require the stoichiometric addition of specific nutrients, requiring additional understanding for feeding strategy optimization 6,11 . Traditional optimization methods include individual media component titration and media blending with mixture designs. However, these methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and involve risks associated with human error 12,13 .\n\nMedia optimization studies previously relied on shake flasks and 1-2 L bioreactors which may be prohibitively expensive in terms of raw materials and human capital. Microplates have also been used but these methods provide limited scalability. Furthermore, this may still require multiple time-consuming runs that introduce batch-to-batch variability which obscures the CQA variability caused by media composition and feeding strategy bench-scale bioreactors through their online feedback control of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and acid/base consumption as well as their real-time data output of quality parameters including off gas composition.

Applications of this approach include: clone screening, temperature and pH shifts, media and supplement optimization. Furthermore, the small reactor volumes are conducive to large Design of Experiments that investigate a wide range of conditions. This allows upstream processes to be significantly optimized before scale-up where experimentation is more limited in scope due to time and economic constraints. Automated microscale bioreactor systems offer various advantages over traditional small scale cell culture units, such as shake flasks or spinner flasks. However, during pilot scale process development significant care must be taken to ensure that these advantages are realized. When run with care, the system can enable high level automation, can be programmed to run DOE's with a higher number of variables and can reduce sampling time when integrated with a nutrient analyzer or cell counter. Integration of the expert-derived heuristics presented here, with current automated microscale bioreactor experiments can minimize common pitfalls that hinder meaningful results. In the extreme, failure to adhere to the principles laid out here can lead to equipment damage that requires expensive repairs. Furthermore, the microbioreactor systems have small culture volumes making characterization of cell culture conditions difficult. The number and amount of samples taken in-process in batch mode culture is limited as operating volumes cannot fall below 10 mL. This method will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of microscale bioreactor systems.\n## Introduction\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were first produced in mouse hybridoma cells in 1975 1 . Since then, an increase in the development of recombinant protein production has taken place to humanize mAbs to increase in vivo safety and efficacy 2,3,4 . Most of the recombinant protein production processes employ Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the ease with which they can be adapted to serum free media, their ability to produce proteins with similar post-translational modifications to that of an innate human protein and their dependability as host cells 5,6 .\n\nDemand is growing to deliver product faster, and for larger patient populations with consistent quality. In addition to the economic benefits, the repertoire of diseases treated by mAbs is increasing, which now includes autoimmune diseases, post-transplantation complications, arthritis, and cancers 7 . Average yields for modern commercial mAb production lines are typically in the range of 5-6 g/L and continue to rise 5 . In part, this has been accomplished through CHO cell engineering and improved production line screening using high-throughput bioreactors 8 . However, most increases in protein production have been attributed to process improvements, including advancements in media optimization, cell culture conditions, and enhanced feeding strategies 7,9,10 . Nutrient supplementation is essential not only for proper cell growth but also for efficient production of high quality protein. Furthermore, cells require the stoichiometric addition of specific nutrients, requiring additional understanding for feeding strategy optimization 6,11 . Traditional optimization methods include individual media component titration and media blending with mixture designs. However, these methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and involve risks associated with human error 12,13 .\n\nMedia optimization studies previously relied on shake flasks and 1-2 L bioreactors which may be prohibitively expensive in terms of raw materials and human capital. Microplates have also been used but these methods provide limited scalability. Furthermore, this may still require multiple time-consuming runs that introduce batch-to-batch variability which obscures the CQA variability caused by media composition and feeding strategy bench-scale bioreactors through their online feedback control of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and acid/base consumption as well as their real-time data output of quality parameters including off gas composition.

However, recombinant biotherapeutic proteins are often expressed as insoluble proteins, thereby limiting the utility of E. coli as expression system. To overcome this limitation, various strategies have been developed, such as changes at DNA level (codon optimization), fusion with soluble tags and variations in process parameters (temperature), and inducer concentration. However, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d strategy. The most commonly used approach involves induction at low temperature, as reducing the temperature during cultivation has been reported to increase bioactive protein production in E. coli. In this study, we examine the impact of various process parameters, such as temperature and inducer concentration, as well as, high plasmid copy number vector for achieving enhanced soluble expression of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor Fab. An interaction amongst these parameters has been observed and their optimization has been demonstrated to result in expression of 30\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mg/L antibody fragment using E. coli. This case study illustrates how process optimization can contribute toward making biotherapeutics affordable.",

While successful production of a variety of sdAbs has been shown in numerous hosts, purification methods are often molecule specific or require affinity tags, which generally cannot be used in clinical manufacturing due to regulatory concerns. Here, we have developed a broadly applicable production and purification process for sdAbs in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) and demonstrated the production of eight different sdAbs at a quality appropriate for nonclinical studies. We developed a two\u2010step, integrated purification process without the use of affinity resins and showed that modification of a single process parameter, pH of the bridging buffer, was required for the successful purification of a variety of sdAbs. Further, we determined that this parameter can be predicted based only on the biophysical characteristics of the target molecule. Using these methods, we produced nonclinical quality sdAbs as few as 5 weeks after identifying the product sequence. Nonclinical studies of three different sdAbs showed that molecules produced using our platform process conferred protection against viral shedding of rotavirus or H1N1 influenza and were equivalent to similar molecules produced in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity tags.",

Love\n## Abstract\nSingle\u2010domain antibodies (sdAbs) offer the affinity and therapeutic value of conventional antibodies, with increased stability and solubility. Unlike conventional antibodies, however, sdAbs do not benefit from a platform manufacturing process. While successful production of a variety of sdAbs has been shown in numerous hosts, purification methods are often molecule specific or require affinity tags, which generally cannot be used in clinical manufacturing due to regulatory concerns. Here, we have developed a broadly applicable production and purification process for sdAbs in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) and demonstrated the production of eight different sdAbs at a quality appropriate for nonclinical studies. We developed a two\u2010step, integrated purification process without the use of affinity resins and showed that modification of a single process parameter, pH of the bridging buffer, was required for the successful purification of a variety of sdAbs. Further, we determined that this parameter can be predicted based only on the biophysical characteristics of the target molecule. Using these methods, we produced nonclinical quality sdAbs as few as 5 weeks after identifying the product sequence. Nonclinical studies of three different sdAbs showed that molecules produced using our platform process conferred protection against viral shedding of rotavirus or H1N1 influenza and were equivalent to similar molecules produced in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity tags.\n## | INTRODUCTION\nRecombinant proteins, including enzymes, cytokines, hormones, antibodies, and antibody derivatives, are used to treat cancer, autoimmune disorders and rare diseases throughout the world.\n\nDevelopment timelines for such biologic drugs are shrinking, particularly with regard to manufacturing process development (Baaj et al., 2017).

However, the market is still dominated by prokaryotic and mammalian expression systems, the former offering high production capacity at a low cost, and the latter favored for the production of complex biopharmaceutical products. Although plant systems are now gaining widespread acceptance as a platform for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, there is still resistance to commercial uptake. This partly reflects the relatively low yields achieved in plants, as well as inconsistent product quality and difficulties with larger-scale downstream processing. Furthermore, there are only a few cases in which plants have demonstrated economic advantages compared to established and approved commercial processes, so industry is reluctant to switch to plant-based production. Nevertheless, some plant-derived proteins for research or cosmetic/pharmaceutical applications have reached the market, showing that plants can excel as a competitive production platform in some niche areas. Here, we discuss the strengths of plant expression systems for specific applications, but mainly address the bottlenecks that must be overcome before plants can compete with conventional systems, enabling the future commercial utilization of plants for the production of valuable proteins.",

Schillberg, N. Raven, H. Spiegel, Stefan Rasche, Matthias Buntru\n## Abstract\nOver the last three decades, the expression of recombinant proteins in plants and plant cells has been promoted as an alternative cost-effective production platform. However, the market is still dominated by prokaryotic and mammalian expression systems, the former offering high production capacity at a low cost, and the latter favored for the production of complex biopharmaceutical products. Although plant systems are now gaining widespread acceptance as a platform for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, there is still resistance to commercial uptake. This partly reflects the relatively low yields achieved in plants, as well as inconsistent product quality and difficulties with larger-scale downstream processing. Furthermore, there are only a few cases in which plants have demonstrated economic advantages compared to established and approved commercial processes, so industry is reluctant to switch to plant-based production. Nevertheless, some plant-derived proteins for research or cosmetic/pharmaceutical applications have reached the market, showing that plants can excel as a competitive production platform in some niche areas. Here, we discuss the strengths of plant expression systems for specific applications, but mainly address the bottlenecks that must be overcome before plants can compete with conventional systems, enabling the future commercial utilization of plants for the production of valuable proteins.\n## Conventional Expression Systems -Mammalian and Prokaryotic Cells\nIndustry favors recombinant protein expression systems that have a long and successful track record, specifically with three goals in mind: high quality, high yields, and low costs. In addition, such systems should meet the demands of an industrial process with respect to robustness, and economic sustainability, and must comply with regulatory requirements. This is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical proteins produced according to good manufacturing practice (GMP), a set of guidelines ensuring that biopharmaceuticals are sufficient in terms of quality and batch-to-batch consistency in order to prevent harm to patients. The industry has therefore focused its resources on a small number of cell-based systems, in particular CHO cells and E. coli, which are now considered the gold standards for industrial protein manufacturing. \n\nMany complex proteins, including most therapeutic antibodies, are routinely produced in CHO cells because they have the capacity to carry out authentic post-translational modifications, including glycosylation.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT We report a case study in which liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) negatively impacted the downstream manufacturability of a therapeutic mAb. Process parameter optimization partially mitigated the LLPS, but limitations remained for large-scale manufacturing. Electrostatic interaction driven self-associations and the resulting formation of high-order complexes are established critical properties that led to LLPS. Through chain swapping substitutions with a well-behaved antibody and subsequent study of their solution behaviors, we found the self-association interactions between the light chains (LCs) of this mAb are responsible for the LLPS behavior. With the aid of in silico homology modeling and charged-patch analysis, seven charged residues in the LC complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were selected for mutagenesis, then evaluated for self-association and LLPS properties. Two charged residues in the light chain (K30 and D50) were identified as the most significant to the LLPS behaviors and to the antigen-binding affinity. Four adjacent charged residues in the light chain (E49, K52, R53, and R92) also contributed to self-association, and thus to LLPS. Molecular engineering substitution of these charged residues with a neutral or oppositely-charged residue disrupted the electrostatic interactions. A double-mutation in CDR2 and CDR3 resulted in a variant that retained antigen-binding affinity and eliminated LLPS. This study demonstrates the critical nature of surface charged resides on LLPS, and highlights the applied power of in silico protein design when applied to improving physiochemical characteristics of therapeutic antibodies. Our study indicates that in silico design and effective protein engineering may be useful in the development of mAbs that encounter similar LLPS issues.",

The mAb-X drug substance produced by the manufacturing process met product-quality specifications suitable for use in clinical studies. However, when the purification process intermediates were stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C, several of the intermediates showed distinct layers resulting in two clear liquid phases (Figure 1a, middle panel). After these intermediates were equilibrated to room temperature and mixed thoroughly, the intermediates became a single homogeneous optically clear phase, and no longer exhibited two liquid phases (data no shown). Once returned to 2 to 8\u00b0C, these intermediates initially became turbid, and then again separated into two phases, which is behavior indicative of LLPS. Both liquid phases contained mAb-X, but the upper phase contained mAb-X at concentrations of 1 to 3 mg/ mL, whereas the lower phase contained the antibody at concentrations of ~150 mg/mL. These observations were consistent with published literature pertaining to LLPS. 1,2,10,19 In large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs, purification intermediates are often kept at ambient temperature for brief intervals (e.g. up to 7 days), but a lower temperature (2-8\u00b0C) is often preferred for longer duration (e.g. more than 7 days). During storage, the aggregate level of mAb-X in the purification intermediates increased quickly when stored at ambient temperature; in contrast, the aggregation rate was reduced dramatically at refrigerator temperatures (Figure 1b). To maintain product quality, storing these intermediates at a refrigerated temperature is preferable, but, as detailed above, resulted in LLPS. \n\nWhen LLPS occurred in these intermediate process pools during storage, the lower phases were found to be highly viscous. The viscosity of the lower (heavy) phases remained exceptionally high (>100 cP) even after the solutions were warmed to room temperature. Mixing these highly viscous heterogeneous intermediates at large-scale and achieving solution homogeneity was time-consuming.",

Damschroder, Timothy M. Pabst, A. Hunter, William K. Wang, Haibin Luo\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT We report a case study in which liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) negatively impacted the downstream manufacturability of a therapeutic mAb. Process parameter optimization partially mitigated the LLPS, but limitations remained for large-scale manufacturing. Electrostatic interaction driven self-associations and the resulting formation of high-order complexes are established critical properties that led to LLPS. Through chain swapping substitutions with a well-behaved antibody and subsequent study of their solution behaviors, we found the self-association interactions between the light chains (LCs) of this mAb are responsible for the LLPS behavior. With the aid of in silico homology modeling and charged-patch analysis, seven charged residues in the LC complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were selected for mutagenesis, then evaluated for self-association and LLPS properties. Two charged residues in the light chain (K30 and D50) were identified as the most significant to the LLPS behaviors and to the antigen-binding affinity. Four adjacent charged residues in the light chain (E49, K52, R53, and R92) also contributed to self-association, and thus to LLPS. Molecular engineering substitution of these charged residues with a neutral or oppositely-charged residue disrupted the electrostatic interactions. A double-mutation in CDR2 and CDR3 resulted in a variant that retained antigen-binding affinity and eliminated LLPS. This study demonstrates the critical nature of surface charged resides on LLPS, and highlights the applied power of in silico protein design when applied to improving physiochemical characteristics of therapeutic antibodies. Our study indicates that in silico design and effective protein engineering may be useful in the development of mAbs that encounter similar LLPS issues.\n## Results\nLLPS of several purification intermediates provoke challenges to the drug substance manufacturing process of mAb-X Figure 1a (left panel) depicts the purification process developed for mAb-X, a human IgG1-\u03bb antibody. The mAb-X drug substance produced by the manufacturing process met product-quality specifications suitable for use in clinical studies. However, when the purification process intermediates were stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C, several of the intermediates showed distinct layers resulting in two clear liquid phases (Figure 1a, middle panel). After these intermediates were equilibrated to room temperature and mixed thoroughly, the intermediates became a single homogeneous optically clear phase, and no longer exhibited two liquid phases (data no shown). Once returned to 2 to 8\u00b0C, these intermediates initially became turbid, and then again separated into two phases, which is behavior indicative of LLPS. Both liquid phases contained mAb-X, but the upper phase contained mAb-X at concentrations of 1 to 3 mg/ mL, whereas the lower phase contained the antibody at concentrations of ~150 mg/mL. These observations were consistent with published literature pertaining to LLPS. 1,2,10,19 In large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs, purification intermediates are often kept at ambient temperature for brief intervals (e.g. up to 7 days), but a lower temperature (2-8\u00b0C) is often preferred for longer duration (e.g. more than 7 days). During storage, the aggregate level of mAb-X in the purification intermediates increased quickly when stored at ambient temperature; in contrast, the aggregation rate was reduced dramatically at refrigerator temperatures (Figure 1b). To maintain product quality, storing these intermediates at a refrigerated temperature is preferable, but, as detailed above, resulted in LLPS. \n\nWhen LLPS occurred in these intermediate process pools during storage, the lower phases were found to be highly viscous. The viscosity of the lower (heavy) phases remained exceptionally high (>100 cP) even after the solutions were warmed to room temperature. Mixing these highly viscous heterogeneous intermediates at large-scale and achieving solution homogeneity was time-consuming.",

Parren\n## Abstract\nThe manufacturing of bispecific antibodies can be challenging for a variety of reasons. For example, protein expression problems, stability issues, or the use of non-standard approaches for manufacturing can result in poor yield or poor facility fit. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of standard antibody platforms for large-scale manufacturing of bispecific IgG1 by controlled Fab-arm exchange. Two parental antibodies that each contain a single matched point mutation in the CH3 region were separately expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and manufactured at 1000 L scale using a platform fed-batch and purification process that was designed for standard antibody production. The bispecific antibody was generated by mixing the two parental molecules under controlled reducing conditions, resulting in efficient Fab-arm exchange of >95% at kg scale. The reductant was removed via diafiltration, resulting in spontaneous reoxidation of interchain disulfide bonds. Aside from the bispecific nature of the molecule, extensive characterization demonstrated that the IgG1 structural integrity was maintained, including function and stability. These results demonstrate the suitability of this bispecific IgG1 format for commercial-scale manufacturing using standard antibody manufacturing techniques.\n",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved the drug Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) produced by carrot cells for treatment of type 1 Gaucher\u2019s disease in 2012. The commercial potential of biomedicines produced by molecular farming has dramatically improved due to the success of an experimental drug called ZMapp, which has immunological activity in Ebola patients. A cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies was produced in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants (Chen and Davis 2016). At present, very few drugs made by this technology have been approved by worldwide authorities such as the U.S. FDA. However, plants have been proposed as a novel paradigm for commercial production of proteins over the next decade. In recent years, leading researchers on molecular farming have given more priority to the area of animal-free therapeutic proteins such as parenteral and oral vaccines. Although plant-based platforms have considerable advantages over traditional systems such as bacterial and animal systems, there are several obstacles to commercial-scale production, especially with regards to improving the quality and quantity of plant-produced biologics and industrial materials. One of the biggest barriers to commercialization of this technology is the intense scrutiny of these new plant varieties by regulatory agencies and the public as well as the high costs associated with their regulatory approval.",

For example, transient expression with deconstructed viral vectors allows production of up to 5 milligrams of monoclonal antibody per gram of fresh leaf weight within 2 weeks (Hefferon 2012). Other advances have looked at the development of inducible viral systems in which deconstructed viruses cannot spread systemically. \n\nTo produce the 10 grams of antibodies needed for a single course of ZMapp immunization, Mapp Biopharmaceutical currently requires 30 to 50 kilograms of tobacco leaves. If tobacco plants could be engineered to produce antibodies more efficiently, that volume could be reduced to about 10 kilograms (Healy 2014). In fact, there are many challenges from logistical, regulatory, and economic aspects to largescale production and use in the case of ZMapp. When the Ebola outbreak was threatening, Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. government) promptly devoted $24.9 million over 18 months to help San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. accelerate production. \n\nTransient expression technology with deconstructed viral vectors has considerable advantages over processes that require generation and selection of transgenic plants, which can take months to years (Chen and Davis 2016). The rapid and high-level protein production capability of transient expression technology makes it an optimal system to produce milligram and gram levels of biologics for preclinical studies. Despite the advantages of a transient expression system, large-scale production using a greenhouse is still limited and therefore relatively expensive. Agrobacteria is more expensive and can accommodate only limited volumes of plant materials. \n\nTherefore, this intermediated version of deconstructed viral vectors have been further studied for the development of a scaled-up manufacturing system of biologics in stable transgenic plants, the production of which often results in low and inconsistent protein yield. Inducible expression of recombinant proteins with deconstructed viral vectors and chemical inducers can be used for yield optimization, as it allows separation of the growth and production phases in manufacturing.",

Wi\n## Abstract\nPlants have great potential as photosynthetic factories to produce pharmaceutically important and commercially valuable biomedicines and industrial proteins at low cost. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved the drug Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) produced by carrot cells for treatment of type 1 Gaucher\u2019s disease in 2012. The commercial potential of biomedicines produced by molecular farming has dramatically improved due to the success of an experimental drug called ZMapp, which has immunological activity in Ebola patients. A cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies was produced in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants (Chen and Davis 2016). At present, very few drugs made by this technology have been approved by worldwide authorities such as the U.S. FDA. However, plants have been proposed as a novel paradigm for commercial production of proteins over the next decade. In recent years, leading researchers on molecular farming have given more priority to the area of animal-free therapeutic proteins such as parenteral and oral vaccines. Although plant-based platforms have considerable advantages over traditional systems such as bacterial and animal systems, there are several obstacles to commercial-scale production, especially with regards to improving the quality and quantity of plant-produced biologics and industrial materials. One of the biggest barriers to commercialization of this technology is the intense scrutiny of these new plant varieties by regulatory agencies and the public as well as the high costs associated with their regulatory approval.\n## New Approaches to Challenges Facing Plant-based Recombinant Protein Production\nmagnICON, geminiviral, and pEAQ) has successfully addressed the challenges facing insufficient protein expression levels, consistency, and speed of biologic production in plants (Chen and Davis 2016). For example, transient expression with deconstructed viral vectors allows production of up to 5 milligrams of monoclonal antibody per gram of fresh leaf weight within 2 weeks (Hefferon 2012). Other advances have looked at the development of inducible viral systems in which deconstructed viruses cannot spread systemically. \n\nTo produce the 10 grams of antibodies needed for a single course of ZMapp immunization, Mapp Biopharmaceutical currently requires 30 to 50 kilograms of tobacco leaves. If tobacco plants could be engineered to produce antibodies more efficiently, that volume could be reduced to about 10 kilograms (Healy 2014). In fact, there are many challenges from logistical, regulatory, and economic aspects to largescale production and use in the case of ZMapp. When the Ebola outbreak was threatening, Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. government) promptly devoted $24.9 million over 18 months to help San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. accelerate production. \n\nTransient expression technology with deconstructed viral vectors has considerable advantages over processes that require generation and selection of transgenic plants, which can take months to years (Chen and Davis 2016). The rapid and high-level protein production capability of transient expression technology makes it an optimal system to produce milligram and gram levels of biologics for preclinical studies. Despite the advantages of a transient expression system, large-scale production using a greenhouse is still limited and therefore relatively expensive. Agrobacteria is more expensive and can accommodate only limited volumes of plant materials. \n\nTherefore, this intermediated version of deconstructed viral vectors have been further studied for the development of a scaled-up manufacturing system of biologics in stable transgenic plants, the production of which often results in low and inconsistent protein yield. Inducible expression of recombinant proteins with deconstructed viral vectors and chemical inducers can be used for yield optimization, as it allows separation of the growth and production phases in manufacturing.",

CoGs can be reduced by dramatically increasing the productivity of the bioreactor process. In this study, we demonstrate that an intensified process which couples a perfused N\u20101 seed reactor and a fully automated high inoculation density (HID) N stage reactor substantially increases the bioreactor productivity as compared to a low inoculation density (LID) control fed\u2010batch process. A panel of six CHOK1SV GS\u2010KO\u00ae CHO cell lines expressing three different monoclonal antibodies was evaluated in this intensified process, achieving an average 85% titer increase and 132% space\u2013time yield (STY) increase was demonstrated when comparing the 12\u2010day HID process to a 15\u2010day LID control process. These productivity increases were enabled by automated nutrient feeding in both the N\u20101 and N stage bioreactors using in\u2010line process analytical technologies (PAT) and feedback control. The N\u20101 bioreactor utilized in\u2010line capacitance to automatically feed the bioreactor based on a capacitance\u2010specific perfusion rate (CapSPR). The N\u2010stage bioreactor utilized in\u2010line Raman spectroscopy to estimate real\u2010time concentrations of glucose, phenylalanine, and methionine, which are held to target set points using automatic feed additions. These automated feeding methodologies were shown to be generalizable across six cell lines with diverse feed requirements. We show this new process can accommodate clonal diversity and reproducibly achieve substantial titer uplifts compared to traditional cell culture processes, thereby establishing a baseline technology platform upon which further increases bioreactor productivity and CoGs reduction can be achieved.",

One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources. \n\nAdvances in antibody production technologies have made giant strides over the last few decades. In 1985, average fed-batch titers were approximately 0.20 g/L, which since then have grown over 1600%, achieving projected average fed-batch titers of 3.20 g/L. 3 However, some literature sources have reported fed-batch titers as high as 10 g/L in 14-18 day processes, indicating that the pace of fed-batch productivity advancements is picking up speed. 4,5 These rising yields can be attributed to incremental advances in cell line engineering, 6 improved process control, 4 and advanced media development within the biopharmaceutical industry. 7 Although reported yields are steadily growing, with the mAb market greatly expanding, the appetite for further bioreactor productivity advancements is higher than ever. To meet this demand, a paradigm shift toward intensified processing is required to make these substantial productivity gains rather than relying on the incremental technological step changes of the past. \n\nOne appealing and highly productive platform process that has gained momentum in recent years is the intensified or high inoculation density (HID) fed-batch bioreactor.",

CoGs can be reduced by dramatically increasing the productivity of the bioreactor process. In this study, we demonstrate that an intensified process which couples a perfused N\u20101 seed reactor and a fully automated high inoculation density (HID) N stage reactor substantially increases the bioreactor productivity as compared to a low inoculation density (LID) control fed\u2010batch process. A panel of six CHOK1SV GS\u2010KO\u00ae CHO cell lines expressing three different monoclonal antibodies was evaluated in this intensified process, achieving an average 85% titer increase and 132% space\u2013time yield (STY) increase was demonstrated when comparing the 12\u2010day HID process to a 15\u2010day LID control process. These productivity increases were enabled by automated nutrient feeding in both the N\u20101 and N stage bioreactors using in\u2010line process analytical technologies (PAT) and feedback control. The N\u20101 bioreactor utilized in\u2010line capacitance to automatically feed the bioreactor based on a capacitance\u2010specific perfusion rate (CapSPR). The N\u2010stage bioreactor utilized in\u2010line Raman spectroscopy to estimate real\u2010time concentrations of glucose, phenylalanine, and methionine, which are held to target set points using automatic feed additions. These automated feeding methodologies were shown to be generalizable across six cell lines with diverse feed requirements. We show this new process can accommodate clonal diversity and reproducibly achieve substantial titer uplifts compared to traditional cell culture processes, thereby establishing a baseline technology platform upon which further increases bioreactor productivity and CoGs reduction can be achieved.\n## | INTRODUCTION\nThe monoclonal antibody (mAb) market has grown exponentially since the first mAb was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986. 1 Since then, monoclonal antibodies have become a dominant presence in the biopharmaceutical market, making up 53% of the 122 new product approvals from 2014 to 2018, a nearly 100% increase over the previous 4 year period. 2 Additionally, the global monoclonal antibody market valuation is ballooning rapidly, with an increase from $115.2 billion in 2018 to an expected $300 billion by 2025. 1 As the commercial pipeline of these proteins expands, a large challenge manufacturers face is dramatically reducing the cost of goods (CoGs) to remain competitive in the growing manufacturing space while also promoting democratization of therapies through reduction of cost to the customer. One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources. \n\nAdvances in antibody production technologies have made giant strides over the last few decades. In 1985, average fed-batch titers were approximately 0.20 g/L, which since then have grown over 1600%, achieving projected average fed-batch titers of 3.20 g/L. 3 However, some literature sources have reported fed-batch titers as high as 10 g/L in 14-18 day processes, indicating that the pace of fed-batch productivity advancements is picking up speed. 4,5 These rising yields can be attributed to incremental advances in cell line engineering, 6 improved process control, 4 and advanced media development within the biopharmaceutical industry. 7 Although reported yields are steadily growing, with the mAb market greatly expanding, the appetite for further bioreactor productivity advancements is higher than ever. To meet this demand, a paradigm shift toward intensified processing is required to make these substantial productivity gains rather than relying on the incremental technological step changes of the past. \n\nOne appealing and highly productive platform process that has gained momentum in recent years is the intensified or high inoculation density (HID) fed-batch bioreactor.",

However, when recombinant scFvs are overexpressed in bacteria, they often form inclusion bodies and exhibit loss of function. To overcome this problem, we developed an scFv secretion system in which scFv was fused with osmotically inducible protein Y (osmY), a bacterial secretory carrier protein, for efficient protein secretion. Anti-EGFR scFv (\u03b1EGFR) was fused with osmY (N- and C-termini) and periplasmic leader sequence (pelB) to generate \u03b1EGFR-osmY, osmY-\u03b1EGFR, and pelB-\u03b1EGFR (control), respectively. In comparison with the control, both the osmY-fused \u03b1EGFR scFvs were soluble and secreted into the LB medium. Furthermore, the yield of soluble \u03b1EGFR-osmY was 20-fold higher, and the amount of secreted protein was 250-fold higher than that of osmY-\u03b1EGFR. In addition, the antigen-binding activity of both the osmY-fused \u03b1EGFRs was 2-fold higher than that of the refolded pelB-\u03b1EGFR from inclusion bodies. Similar results were observed with \u03b1TAG72-osmY and \u03b1Her2-osmY. These results suggest that the N-terminus of osmY fused with scFv produces a high yield of soluble, functional, and secreted scFv, and the osmY-based bacterial secretion system may be used for the large-scale industrial production of low-cost \u03b1EGFR protein.",

Therefore, they have been widely used in industrial, medical diagnostic, and research and therapeutic applications [4][5][6]. Currently, there is a need to develop cost-effective approaches for the mass production of scFvs. When compared with other expression strategies, the bacterial expression system is the most economic strategy for the production of scFv antibodies [7,8]. However, the mass production of scFvs in the bacterial cytoplasm or periplasmic space often leads to protein misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation within inclusion bodies [9,10]. To circumvent these problems, Jurado et al. showed that if the culture temperature is reduced to 16uC, the ratio of the soluble fraction versus whole cell protein extracts of Trx-scFv B7 increased 6-fold, but Trx-scFv B7 in whole cell protein extracts also decreased by approximately 80% [11]. This indicates that lower growth temperature enhanced the solubility of scFv but reduced the total protein production. In addition, Hu et al. demonstrated that the proper folding of recombinant scFv was enhanced when domoic acid-binding scFv was co-expressed with the Escherichia coli chaperone DnaKJE. Although a 35% increase in the yield of the soluble fraction was achieved by this method, the production process in the bacteria was more complicated [12]. In contrast, protein purification from bacterial extracts has been associated with a high risk of contamination, posing additional challenges in acquiring highly pure proteins [13,14]. The secretion of scFvs into the LB medium would enhance the proper folding of recombinant scFvs, prevent protein contamination, and simplify the protein purification process to potentially allow large-scale cost-effective production of scFvs.",

Liao, Ta-Chun Cheng, Chih-Hung Chuang, Yuan-Chin Hsieh, M. Tai, Tian-Lu Cheng\n## Abstract\nSingle-chain variable fragments (scFvs) serve as an alternative to full-length monoclonal antibodies used in research and therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, when recombinant scFvs are overexpressed in bacteria, they often form inclusion bodies and exhibit loss of function. To overcome this problem, we developed an scFv secretion system in which scFv was fused with osmotically inducible protein Y (osmY), a bacterial secretory carrier protein, for efficient protein secretion. Anti-EGFR scFv (\u03b1EGFR) was fused with osmY (N- and C-termini) and periplasmic leader sequence (pelB) to generate \u03b1EGFR-osmY, osmY-\u03b1EGFR, and pelB-\u03b1EGFR (control), respectively. In comparison with the control, both the osmY-fused \u03b1EGFR scFvs were soluble and secreted into the LB medium. Furthermore, the yield of soluble \u03b1EGFR-osmY was 20-fold higher, and the amount of secreted protein was 250-fold higher than that of osmY-\u03b1EGFR. In addition, the antigen-binding activity of both the osmY-fused \u03b1EGFRs was 2-fold higher than that of the refolded pelB-\u03b1EGFR from inclusion bodies. Similar results were observed with \u03b1TAG72-osmY and \u03b1Her2-osmY. These results suggest that the N-terminus of osmY fused with scFv produces a high yield of soluble, functional, and secreted scFv, and the osmY-based bacterial secretion system may be used for the large-scale industrial production of low-cost \u03b1EGFR protein.\n## Introduction\nSingle-chain variable fragments (scFvs) retain the original antigen-binding activity and possess several unique properties such as small size, easy engineering, good tumor penetration, rapid blood clearance, and low antigenicity [1][2][3]. Therefore, they have been widely used in industrial, medical diagnostic, and research and therapeutic applications [4][5][6]. Currently, there is a need to develop cost-effective approaches for the mass production of scFvs. When compared with other expression strategies, the bacterial expression system is the most economic strategy for the production of scFv antibodies [7,8]. However, the mass production of scFvs in the bacterial cytoplasm or periplasmic space often leads to protein misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation within inclusion bodies [9,10]. To circumvent these problems, Jurado et al. showed that if the culture temperature is reduced to 16uC, the ratio of the soluble fraction versus whole cell protein extracts of Trx-scFv B7 increased 6-fold, but Trx-scFv B7 in whole cell protein extracts also decreased by approximately 80% [11]. This indicates that lower growth temperature enhanced the solubility of scFv but reduced the total protein production. In addition, Hu et al. demonstrated that the proper folding of recombinant scFv was enhanced when domoic acid-binding scFv was co-expressed with the Escherichia coli chaperone DnaKJE. Although a 35% increase in the yield of the soluble fraction was achieved by this method, the production process in the bacteria was more complicated [12]. In contrast, protein purification from bacterial extracts has been associated with a high risk of contamination, posing additional challenges in acquiring highly pure proteins [13,14]. The secretion of scFvs into the LB medium would enhance the proper folding of recombinant scFvs, prevent protein contamination, and simplify the protein purification process to potentially allow large-scale cost-effective production of scFvs.",

            "text": "GIGA-2050 is the first example of a new class of drugs, recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins. Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies [16]. Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia [17] but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies. \n\nAs multivalent antibody therapeutics, recombinant hyperimmune globulins represent a potent treatment for infectious disease that decreases the likelihood of antigenic escape. Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters [18]. Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses. \n\nWe have demonstrated that a conventional mAb platform approach can be applied to a recombinant hyperimmune globulin product to achieve desired separation of aggregates and process related impurities. The platform production process has produced the GIGA-2050 drug substance and drug product lots at different scales and manufacturing sites that have demonstrated no substantial differences in the purity measurements and impurity clearance for in-process steps and analytically comparable characteristics and quality attributes of the final drug substance. In the future, we hope to apply similar methods to larger scale GMP runs, for example, bioreactors with a capacity of 1000 L or higher.",

Two critical aspects of biopharmaceutical product manufacturing are the time-complexity quotient of producing Phase 1 and 2 clinical material and production cost of commercial material in large quantities. The former is concerned with speed and the ability to overcome challenges related to product and process biochemistry and resourcing within the context of a fast-moving candidate pipeline. The performance and success of the latter hinges on the cost of goods (COGs) and productivity per facility per year (g/sqft/yr). While it may not be immediately apparent, both stages of the process greatly benefit from a platform approach to bioprocess engineering with a high degree of robustness, and compact and highly productive manufacturing systems. \n\n4][5][6] These upstream advancements have put considerable pressure on purification processes, 6,7 which involve isolating the target protein from a complex mixture that includes host cell proteins (HCPs), residual DNA, aggregates, media components, virus, and endotoxins. Higher titer correlates with increased amounts of these impurities, and poses both capacity and impurity challenges to downstream purification. 8 Furthermore, increasing cell densities, longer cell-culture duration, and higher product titers have challenged the basic design of the downstream train to deal with additional cell mass, cell debris, HCP, DNA, adventitious and endogenous viruses, and other impurities like media components. 5,9",

Some factors include improving the accessibility of these medicines for global populations (Kelley, Renshaw, and Kamarck 2021), increasing requirements for sustainable bioprocessing (Lalor et al. 2019), reducing time to market as a key business advantage, and responding rapidly to global events like pandemics (Brady and Love 2021). For example, the high cost of goods manufactured (COGSm), which today can range from $30-100 per gram of antibody (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes 2010), is one of two major constraints to access of these medicines in low-and middleincome countries (LMICs); indeed, 80% of all doses for registered products are administered only in North America and Europe (IAVI/Wellcome 2020). Corporate commitments to reduce carbon footprints and geopolitical interests for enabling a circular bioeconomy also underscore the importance for continued developments to intensify, consolidate and reduce energy, water, and raw materials used in bioprocessing (Bunnak et al. 2016;Pietrzykowski et al. 2013). Finally, accelerated development demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic showed the potential to reduce the time from discovery to firstin-human clinical trials to 4-6 months, albeit with significant corporate and regulatory cooperation (Kelley, 2020). These examples emphasize the possibility for more rapid development, clinical assessment, and commercialization of innovative new biopharmaceuticals. Together, these factors motivate the need for continued innovations in the approaches to manufacture mAbs (and other recombinant proteins) with shorter development timelines, lower production costs, and improved sustainability. \n\nThe existing infrastructure to manufacture therapeutic mAbs has evolved through the continuous improvement of now standardized \"platform\" processes using CHO cells (Kelley, Kiss, and Laird 2018). The space-time yields for state-of-the-art fed-batch processes can reach ~0.2-0.5 g/L/day with fully continuous processing achieving up to ~2-4 g/L/day (Kelley, Kiss, and Laird 2018;Mahal, Branton, and Farid 2021).",

For antibody manufacturing process development, maintaining desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, maintaining cost effectiveness, and providing manufacturing flexibility are key issues in today's competitive market, where several companies are often working on therapies for similar targets and clinical indications. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, manufacturing capacity becomes an issue because the drug substance must be produced in large quantities with cost and time efficiency to meet clinical requirements and pave the way toward commercialization. In response to the strong demand, many companies have built large scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors. \n\nIn terms of manufacturability and scalability, mammalian cells have historically been considered difficult to work with due to factors such as low yield, medium complexity, serum requirement, and shear sensitivity, although the latter has generally been incorrectly overemphasized. After two decades of intensive development work in cell line, media and bioreactor condition optimization, cell specific productivity of over 20 pg/cell/day can be routinely achieved for production cell lines; 1 high titers up to \u223c10 g/L and cell densities of over 20 million cells/mL in fed-batch processes have been recently reported by a few companies at major conferences. The enhancement of specific productivity per cell is achieved not only by selection of highly productive clones, but also by optimization of medium composition and bioreactor operation conditions. Today, the combination of high titers and large capacity has gradually shifted the focus of cell culture process development from pursing even higher titers to controlling product quality and process consistency at all development stages and production scales. 3 ell culture process development starts with cell line generation and selection, followed by process and media optimization in small scale systems, including 96-well plates, shaker flasks, and bench-scale bioreactors, for high throughput screening purposes.",

            "text": "Commercial production of recombinant therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is one of the therapeutic areas that have undergone remarkable improvements with the implementation of various novel technologies over the last decade or so. To minimize the manufacturing cost and timeline, platform technologies have been developed for the similar categories of drug and the regulatory requirements, which includes an engineered production host, cell line screening and selection devices, media and feed selection, advancement in upstream and downstream processes and process intensification by implementing continuous manufacturing. In addition, a revolution in the use of single use devices has improved and simplifies the production processes significantly, which offers a cost-effective product development for small-scale to mid-scale production processes (Chon and Zarbis-Papastoitsis, 2011). \n\nThe bacterial host Escherichia coli is the most popular expression system used for the production of a quite good number of recombinant proteins (Akesson et al., 2001;Jana and Deb, 2005; used for the production of couple of recombinant therapeutic proteins. The major advantage of mammalian cells over above described system is that this system produces recombinant proteins with the most closure to human glycosylation and other post-translational modifications with the highest reliability (Dalton and Barton, 2014). A therapeutic enzyme, Activase R was the first FDA approved recombinant protein developed in mammalian CHO cells in 1987 (Jayapal et al., 2007), since then over 100 recombinant proteins so far has been made using the mammalian system. Since 2011, FDA has approved 48 novel therapeutic proteins (Table 2) out of which 29 are recombinant mAbs produced either by CHO or mouse myeloma cells. The total sale of one of the blockbuster mAbs Adalimumab (Humira) has reached to $12.5 billion in 2014-2015 (Morrison, 2015).",

            "text": "There is an ever-increasing requirement for protein production in industrial and academic settings for a variety of applications. These include exploratory research, drug discovery initiatives, biopharmaceutical production, target validation, and high-throughput screening. Some 200 recombinant proteins-based biopharmaceuticals have gained approval so far for human therapeutic and/or diagnostic use and in excess of 350 are currently in late-stage clinical trials [1]. Notably, pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America (http://www.phrma.com/) have estimated that its member companies are developing or providing funding for pursuing the development of some 320 biotechnology medicines, with most of these being protein-based. For example, thirty therapeutic complete monoclonal antibodies and three antibody fragments have been approved so far by US FDA as of January 2012 and over 240 are in the developmental stages [1][2][3]. In addition to biopharmaceuticals, structural genomic initiatives also require milligram (mg) amounts of protein for three-dimensional (3D) structure representations. According to TargetDB statistics as of the first of March 22, 2012, some 295,015 targets have been deposited, out of which 202,005 have been cloned with 128,852 being expressed and 47,784 subsequently purified (http://targetdb-dev.rutgers .edu/TargetDB-dev/stats.html). While currently employed large-scale production strategies yield cell culture/fermentation titres containing up to tens of grams per litre, there is a subsequent need to ensure that all impurities are removed and that sufficient amounts of highly purified protein are obtained for the desired application (http://www.genengnews .com/gen-articles/downstream-bottlenecks-more-than-justperception/4129/). Furthermore, escalating demands for increased protein titres, primarily for economic reasons, have shifted the bottleneck step from production to purification, with downstream processes (inclusive of purification) representing between 45 and 92% of the total cost of manufacturing a recombinant protein [4,5].",

            "text": "Bioprocessing technology for production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has advanced greatly since their introduction into the market in 1986. Early murine mAbs were derived from hybridoma cell lines, using diverse production technology; the first licensed mAb therapeutic, OKT3, was produced in the ascites of mice. 1 The development of recombinant technology based on cloning and expression of the heavy and light chain antibody genes in CHO cells enabled mAb production to take advantage of the common technologies already used for recombinant products like tissue plasminogen activator, erythropoietin, Factor VIII, etc. These recombinant cell culture processes for antibody production initially had low expression levels, with titers typically well below 1 g/L. 2 The combination of low titers and large market demands for some of the first recombinant mAbs like rituximab (Rituxan), trastuzumab (Herceptin), infliximab (Remicade) and others drove many companies and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to build large production plants containing multiple bioreactors with volumes of 10,000 L or larger. Other products derived from mammalian cell culture in the mid-90s also required large production capacity (Enbrel, while not a mAb, is an Fc-fusion protein which is produced using a similar manufacturing process), driving further expansion. In parallel with the increase in bioreactor production capacity throughout the bioprocessing industry, improvements in the production processes resulted in increased expression levels and higher cell densities, which combined to provide much higher product titers.\n\nToday, the potential of combining high titer process technology with the large installed bioreactor base has resulted in a great excess of production capacity for mAbs, far outstripping the increase in market demands over recent years. This has stimulated discussions of the controversial issues of the best use of current production capacity, the impact of manufacturing cost of goods (COGs), and the choice of the appropriate mAb production technology for emerging product candidates. Should companies choose conventional bioprocessing technologies, or invest in novel technologies which may lead to superior expression levels or lower production costs? Have process development strategies adjusted to this paradigm shift where nearly unlimited capacity and very low COGs are",

            "text": "Recombinant production methods result to highly stable and therefore advantageous products, encompassing a proven track record of clinical safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of unknown side effects, carrier-related allergic reactions and withdrawals. These vaccines require minimal maintenance to preserve their stability and functionality hence they can be stored at temperature between 2 to 8 \u00b0C for long periods, and can be maintained before use at room temperature with no decomposition. Consequently, this feature ameliorates any respective logistical challenges and minimizes the risks related to post-production regulatory withdrawals. From Chinese Ovary Cell and bacterial cell factories to the necessary chromatographic resins, all the components required for production are accessible for the pharmaceutical industry, with negligible chances of future shortages and extreme price fluctuations, even in case when industrial scale quantities are required. However, it is uncertain whether relying on this production scenario could be successful under the capacities required in case of pandemic outbreaks i.e. whether the economies of scale required should be reached in short time. One of the major drawbacks of the recombinant DNA vaccine production platform is its complicated and therefore difficult-toautomate sub-processes, which constitute any standardization efforts a challenge. As a result, this technology requires additional personnel for process supervision and control purposes. Consequently, the above-mentioned intrinsic barriers constitute the platform less appropriate for encountering pandemic bursts or even following up their mutations, whereas in such cases delay of response can cause devastating results to global health systems and to patients. Furthermore, cellular protein production carries high risk of material contamination, particularly in the upstream processing. The cells used are complex and require strict sanitization measures, which increases the likelihood of contamination and costs. In the event of contamination, the cell line and its products must be discarded, resulting in additional delays and hard to predict financial losses. In addition to contamination risks, recombinant DNA and protein production methods feature low production yield due to the nature of the related live processes. For the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA platform, in the best-case study scenario for every kilogram that is produced in the upstream line, only 600-700 g are obtained in the required by the regulatory agencies' purity.",

            "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

            "text": "Abstract This review article concerns the production of recombinant antibody fragments for applications mainly in the diagnostic sector. The so-called \u201cpoint of care diagnostics\u201d is very important for timely diagnosis and treatment, thus being able to save lives and resources. There is intense pressure for more accurate and less expensive rapid diagnostic tests, with a value preferably <$1. Thus, the large-scale cost-effective production of recombinant antibodies is vital. The importance of Escherichia coli toward the production of inexpensive rapid tests will be explained in this review paper. Details about the different strains of E. coli, the strategies used for the insertion and the expression of recombinant proteins, and the challenges that still exist are provided. Afterward, the importance of the expression scale and culture parameters in the final yield of the antibodies are examined. From this analysis, it appears that for good yields of recombinant antibodies, aside from appropriate gene transfer and expression, the culturing parameters are of paramount importance. Larger scale production is more favorable, mainly due to the higher cell densities that can be achieved. Yields of functional Fab fragments in the range of 10\u201320\u2009mg/L are considered good in shake flasks, whereas in bioreactors can be up to 1\u20132\u2009g/L. An amount of 10\u2013500\u2009mg of such antibody per million rapid tests is required. Despite the substantial importance of the production of the antibodies and their fragments, their downstream processing should be appropriately considered from the beginning for achieving the target value of the final rapid diagnostic tests.",

However, ex vivo, large-scale cell manufacturing requires production platforms enabling costeffective expansion to generate clinically relevant numbers. 1 This prerequisite presents significant challenges that are constrained by current manual, open, small-scale production methodologies/systems. Another impediment to broad clinical use includes the numerous early-stage ATMP candidates which require human operators to undertake critical functions and are driven by academic sites, clinical centers and SMEs which lack resources and expertise to automate and scale manufacturing processes. 2 e use of cell-based manufacturing systems for human medicines has led to successful outcomes in recent decades. Recombinant protein drugs (cytokines/monoclonal antibodies) are produced using various expression systems inserted into immortalized CHO cells, capable of unlimited expansion at scale. A new challenge arises when the therapeutic product is the cell itself rather than its protein product. Cell therapies use expanded nonimmortalized, primary cells with complex biological characteristics, whether autologous or allogeneic. Despite these obstacles, the field has made enormous strides in recent years with many outstanding examples, for example, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for immune disorders or degenerative conditions such as Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis. More recently, MSCs were tested in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARs-CoV-2 infection. 3 e emergence of efficient production systems for clinical grade MSCs using scalable bioreactors has been slow. Current production systems mainly involve laboratory-scale manual processing using flasks or cell factories and the dispersed nature of such manufacturing is associated with exceptionally poor process standardization. 4 Critical process parameters including cell source, media composition, seeding density, passage number, and final dose formulation are highly variable. Additionally, process checkpoints and quality control are not uniformly applied and industry standards for release criteria and potency testing have not yet emerged. Current methods generally require full grade A containment levels for qualification, sterility control and maintenance contributing to the very high costs associated with approval and market entry. \n\nThere is an urgent need for highly efficient automated manufacturing platforms for the production of ATMPs for patient benefit.",

However, the advanced mammalian folding, secretion and post-translational apparatus is capable of producing antibodies indistinguishable from those in the human body with least concerns for immunogenic modifications. Moreover, it is also highly efficient for secretion of large and complex IgGs and in combination with the folding and post-translational control it results in high product quality which reduces efforts and costs in the subsequent and more expensive downstream processing steps. The risks of contamination by pathogens or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (TSE/BSE) agents have been eliminated by well-documented Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant designer cell substrates and chemical defined media without the need of supplementing animal serum components (145). In 2004, mammalian cell culture technology reached production levels of approximately 5 g/L IgGs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (146). Today, industrial IgG production levels often exceed 12 g/L as the result of a steadily ongoing progress in mammalian cell culture technology, which is mainly due to improved high producer cell lines, optimized production media, and prolonged production processes at high-cell densities. The highest reported IgG production titer we found was obtained in the human embryonic retinal cell line Per.C6 [Crucell, Leiden, Netherlands, (147)] with 27 g/L. Generally, the productivity of recombinant mammalian cell lines increased from initially 10 pg antibody per cell per day (pcd) in 1986 to about 90 pcd in 2004. Today, the antibody production levels only rarely exceed 100 pcd because higher cellular productivity usually corresponds to lower maximum cell densities in the production process. Producer cell lines have also been genetically engineered regarding product homogeneity, improved metabolism, reduced apoptosis, and inducible cell cycle arrest (148,149) which allows prolonged production times for almost 3 weeks at high-cell viability and cell densities. \n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most common cells applied in the commercial production of biopharmaceuticals.",

            "text": "Hence, considerable focus is being imparted on biologicals as active pharmaceutical ingredients to manage, control, and eradicate diseases. A survey conducted between January 2018 and June 2022 in the United States and/or European Union (EU) witnessed the approval of 180 distinct biopharmaceutical active ingredients that entered the market and they could be categorized as recombinant clotting factors; recombinant thrombolytics, anticoagulants, and other blood-related products; recombinant hormones; recombinant growth factors; recombinant interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); vaccines; monoclonal-antibody-based products; and other recombinant products. These biologicals are mostly focused on cancer, followed by inflammation-related conditions, neutropenia, diabetes, viral and bacterial infection, weight control, weight loss (Wegovy), and Alzheimer's disease (Aduhelm). The genre of monoclonal antibodies continues to lead in the number of approvals and sales (Fig. 1), although COVID-19 vaccines are listed as the highest-grossing individual products [4]. Despite continual therapeutic attention, structural complexity and the larger molecular size of biopharmaceuticals add up to difficulty in drug design and formulation development. Hence, subsequent manufacturing and distribution of biopharmaceuticals also face challenges including their storage which often demands refrigeration. Further, regulatory compliance in biopharmaceutical manufacturing is one of the toughest hurdles that often accompany facility inspection. Considering the complex multi-layered manufacturing process and critical in-process quality controls and analysis of finished products, it becomes a challenge for manufacturers to successfully comply with the norms of regulatory science and good manufacturing practices. Beyond pharmaceutical considerations, the clinical administration of biologics also demands attention, especially for immunogenic reactions that need to be monitored in patients following the administration of the biopharmaceuticals. \n\n\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

Vaccine candidates based on recombinant protein subunits remain important because they can be manufactured at low costs in existing large-scale production facilities that use microbial hosts like Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris). Here, we report an improved and scalable manufacturing approach for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD); this protein is a key antigen for several reported vaccine candidates. We genetically engineered a manufacturing strain of K. phaffii to obviate the requirement for methanol-induction of the recombinant gene. Methanol-free production improved the secreted titer of the RBD protein by >5x by alleviating protein folding stress. Removal of methanol from the production process enabled scale up to a 1,200 L pre-existing production facility. This engineered strain is now used to produce an RBD-based vaccine antigen that is currently in clinical trials and could be used to produce other variants of RBD as needed for future vaccines.",

            "text": "Since its conception, a major driving force for producing recombinant biologics in plants, or plant molecular farming, has been the potential to cheaply produce pharmaceuticals where they are needed most in the developing world (Rybicki, 2010). Although many of the envisioned advantages of the system still hold true-most notably lower infrastructure requirements and production costs-the capital outlay to build a production facility remains a significant barrier to establishing manufacturing capacity in resource-limited areas (Murad et al., 2019;Margolin et al., 2020a). Additional challenges that hinder the acceptance of plants as a mainstream production platform are low yields for some proteins, and differences in the host biosynthetic machinery which may compromise certain necessary posttranslational modifications (PTMs) (Margolin et al., 2020c). Both of these obstacles are probably related: post-translational processing dictates protein folding and misfolded proteins are degraded by quality control systems, therefore accounting for low protein yields in some instances (Strasser, 2018). \n\nMolecular farming has often been proposed as a platform for vaccine and therapeutic manufacturing, particularly in response to pandemic outbreaks (Rigano et al., 2009;Streatfield et al., 2015;Margolin et al., 2020a). This is primarily due to the rapid production time frame, scalability of transient expression and the capacity to mediate most PTMs required for the biological activity of mammalian proteins (Faye et al., 2005;Holtz et al., 2015). Accordingly, many promising biologics have been produced in plant systems to combat human and veterinary pathogens, including multicomponent virus-like particles (VLP) (Thuenemann et al., 2013;Dennis et al., 2018), and numerous recombinant antibodies (Zeitlin et al., 2016;Hurtado et al., 2020;Singh et al., 2020). Objectively, therapeutic antibodies and viral structural components can generally be readily produced in plants and assemble as expected, but the expression of many viral glycoproteins in the system remains an arduous task (Margolin et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has changed the landscape of modern medicine. To date, there are over 80 different mAb biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, asthma, and autoimmunity, among others. With these successes, the field is expanding into new and exciting related areas for biologics that target multiple specificities. This includes a range of bispecific and trispecific mAbs which can bind to the same or multiple antigens. Among the newest mAb-related biologics are bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), bispecific and trispecific killer cell engagers (BiKEs and TRiKEs), and dual-affinity re-targeting antibodies (DARTs), as well as many others (reviewed in Ref. [1] and Fig. 1). These developments are the direct result of over 40 years of continuous advances in mAb isolation approaches, including hybridoma technologies, yeast surface display, phage display, and, more recently, single B-cell sorting strategies that identify paired heavy chain and light chain from single cells, among others (reviewed in Refs. [2] and [3]). New structural engineering strategies to improve potency and cell culture production, as well as the parallel development of sophisticated bioprocess manufacturing technologies, have additionally contributed to meet the growing demands for mAb biologics [4]. Despite these many advances, large-scale bioprocessing is faced with challenges that currently hamper wider global deployment. The intrinsic biochemical and biophysical properties of antibody sequences are frequent liabilities for large-scale manufacturing and may also lead to post-manufacturing aggregation and stability issues. Such limitations may prevent an otherwise highly potent and effective mAb from advancing through development and into the clinic [5,6]. Delivery challenges must also be overcome as in vivo administration of mAb biologics often requires high doses (grams of mAb) to achieve therapeutic efficacy, frequently at a high cost (Fig. 2). While the cost of raw materials is relatively inexpensive, bioprocess manufacturing and purification can be lengthy and costly (reviewed in Ref. [7]).",

            "text": "The fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode [19][20][21]. The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls [19,21,22]. Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices [23]. \n\nThere are few studies on the use of LOC-type devices to produce recombinant proteins [24]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the production of an anti-hIFN-\u03b12b recombinant mAb with Chinese hamster ovary, CHO, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells in standard-size microfluidic devices with a final volume of 32.22 \u00b5L [25]. It was possible to increase the concentration of the antibodies up to 7.3 times higher (1120 pg of mAb per cell) than that obtained by standard culture methodologies (using T-flasks). Moreover, the functional activity of the antibodies produced in the microdevice (neutralization of the cellular cytokine signaling) did not present a significant difference from those obtained in the control culture. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to scale up the production of recombinant proteins in the large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor). To achieve that, we developed the LM bioreactor with a novel fabrication technique [26] and we validated the technology by producing and characterizing mAbs.",

            "text": "Vaccination is a fundamental strategy for the prevention of endemic or emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the implementation and development of vaccine technologies that allow for timely and scalable manufacture are highly desired [26]. Despite several advancements, the inherent biological complexity and resulting variability in the manufacturing process, coupled with strict regulatory specifications, add to the lengthy and costly nature of traditional vaccine production [32]. Novel platform solutions entailing multiple alternative approaches for antigen and vector design, production, and formulation [33,34] are required to match both the speed and productivity of emerging technologies such as mRNA as well as the need to adapt processes to yield drug products of highest desirable safety and immunogenicity [35,36]. Overall, it thus becomes evident that universally applicable manufacturing solutions do not exist. Here, we describe a workflow for upstream process development for the high-yield production of live recombinant YF17D-vectored vaccines using YF-ZIK as an example [12]. Our stepwise approach guides efficient process optimization by screening multiple parameters in a targeted high-throughput manner, providing a blueprint that might be applicable to other live-attenuated and vectored viral vaccines both established and currently in development.",

            "text": "Plant-based expression systems are gaining increased attention for the production of recombinant proteins, including subunit vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (Sack et al., 2015;Group et al., 2016). This is largely driven by the potential for more rapid implementation timelines and capacity for rapid production scale-up when compared to established expression systems. The upfront capital investment for a plantbased manufacturing facility is also considerably lower than for mammalian cell production, and the production costs for the raw material are similarly reduced (Nandi et al., 2016). These features are appealing to low-and middle-income countries where biomanufacturing capacity is urgently needed, but is mostly absent (Margolin et al., 2020a). The inherent ease of biomass production also offers the prospect of rapid vaccine production in response to pandemic viral outbreaks (Margolin et al., 2018), as has recently been demonstrated by Medicago Inc., in Canada for a SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate (Ward et al., 2020a). However, products from plantbased expression systems may not always display desired critical quality attributes: for example, when a biologic requires extensive post-translational modifications, that are not performed in plants as in other cell types, there is consequently a need to further develop plant-based expression technologies to better support the production of complex pharmaceutical products such as glycosylated biologics (Margolin et al., 2020b). \n\nIdeally, a plant-based manufacturing platform should support high yields of recombinant proteins that are appropriately posttranslationally processed and biologically active. Encouraging findings have been described for many targets, including the clinical development of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 VLP-based vaccines, and the emergency use of plant-made antibody cocktails for treatment of Ebola virus infection (Landry et al., 2010;Ward et al., 2014;Group et al., 2016;Pillet et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production is now a multibillion-dollar market, and about 25% of commercial pharmaceuticals are biopharmaceuticals (Weinacker et al., 2013). The ever-increasing demand for therapeutic antibodies may force many companies to change from batch processing to continuous production, because traditional fed-batch manufacturing cannot generate the huge quantities of r-proteins required without huge capital investments in a new plant (Warikoo et al., 2012). In addition to increasing demand, the desire for reduced processing costs and requirements for consistent quality and higher productivity are among the key drivers for this transition from batch to continuous in the biotechnology industry (Rathore, Agarwal, Sharma, Pathak, & Muthukumar, 2015). \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous processing requires the implementation of quality-by-design principles and new product development processes (Hernandez, 2015). On the other hand, short process development times, low tolerance to risk, and cost control under stringent quality/regulatory requirements make the implementation of new technologies a challenge for the biotechnology companies (Rathore et al., 2015). Thus, the development of new approaches and techniques that will reduce the risk and time required for upstream process development and optimization is essential. For a continuous process, an important consideration during the development of novel cell lines and growth media should be to generate stable and robust processes that are able to maintain high productivity over a considerable period of continuous operation. \n\nThe choice of a vehicle organism for r-protein production is often determined by the nature of the recombinant product, with mammalian systems being preferred for the production of large, glycosylated proteins, and microbial cells for smaller unmodified proteins. Recent advances in the humanization of the microbial pathways for protein glycosylation and the burgeoning demand for continuous processes make microbial eukaryotes and particularly yeasts increasingly attractive vehicles for the production of complex human proteins (Maccani et al., 2014). Among the yeasts, Komagataella phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) has been the species most often used for the production of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes.",

            "text": "Plant-based manufacturing of recombinant proteins is an attractive platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals, with its unique advantages of scalability and cost (D'Aoust et al., 2010;Tschofen et al., 2016). This is mainly due to the cost-effective growth of large amounts of plant biomass in a short time frame, but also a result of the lower infrastructure requirements for protein production in plants (Nandi et al., 2016;Paul et al., 2013;Rybicki, 2010). These advantages render the technology particularly appealing to developing countries where the capacity to manufacture biopharmaceuticals is often not available, and more generally, where rapid responses to pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases may be necessary (Rybicki, 2009;Rybicki, 2010). \n\nHowever, despite these unique advantages, the clinical deployment of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMP) has been confined to niche areas where the current paradigm of biopharmaceutical production is lacking (Paul et al., 2013;Stoger et al., 2014). This is partly a reflection of the low yields of many proteins during the infancy of the technology, and the realization that certain posttranslational modifications may not occur optimally in the system (Castilho et al., 2018;Gomord and Faye, 2004;Loos et al., 2015;Mamedov et al., 2019;Rybicki, 2010;Strasser, 2016;Streatfield, 2007;Wilbers et al., 2016). The development of improved expression technologies now enables the production of most heterologous proteins in plants at reasonably high levels, although many viral glycoproteins still appear to be produced inefficiently in the system (Lomonossoff and D'Aoust, 2016;Margolin et al., 2018;Peyret and Lomonossoff, 2015). This severely limits the utility of the platform for the production of vaccines against many emerging viruses and pandemic viruses which generally are thought to require the induction of antibodies against the surface viral glycoproteins to protect against infection (Murin et al., 2019;Rey and Lok, 2018).",

            "text": "In recent years, with the development and application of proteomics technology, the development of large-scale culture of animal cells for antibody drug production has devolved from the simple optimization of some process parameters to the recent omics research, e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and fluxomics. The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2022). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs. \n\nThe high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies can be affected by multiple factors, which can be achieved by genetic engineering, including the optimization of antibody gene sequence, construction of efficient expression vector, optimization of antibody expression system, modification of antibody host cells, and glycosylation site modification (Table 3). The application of these optimization strategies can effectively shorten the time of antibody generation and improve the expression of target antibodies. However, different optimization strategies have advantages and disadvantages, and how to effectively integrate these optimization strategies to make it an efficient operation system needs further study. Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies. Therefore, the focus shifts towards how to control the quality of recombinant antibody drugs scientifically and rationally, researchers should further combine the clinical evaluation and post-market safety monitoring, and continue to explore quality control.",

However, the use of living organisms also introduces several operational challenges related to batch-to-batch variability in the production outcomes. \n\nThe drug substance manufacturing can be broadly categorized into two main steps: fermentation and purification operations. During the fermentation process, the living organisms grow and produce the desired active ingredients. Specific characteristics of active ingredients (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, biomass, proteins, antigens, etc.) could vary across different drugs. In the remainder of this paper, we refer to the resulting target active ingredient as protein. \n\nAfter fermentation, the batch continues with a series of purification operations to comply with stringent regulatory requirements on safety and quality. Our main focus in this study is the fermentation process. \n\nThe fermentation process is typically carried out inside a stainless steel vessel called bioreactor. Bioreactors are equipped with advanced sensors to achieve a highly controlled environment via monitoring of critical process parameters (e.g., cell growth rate, protein accumulation, impurity accumulation, etc.). Figure 1 uses industry data to illustrate the main dynamics of a batch fermentation process. As the fermentation continues, we observe from Figure 1(a) that the amount of protein produced during fermentation increases exponentially over time. Hence, this specific phase of fermentation is known as the exponential growth phase. However, the exponential growth phase continues only for a finite period of time (e.g., several hours or days depending on the application) because of the inherent limitations of biological processes (e.g., limitations in media, cell viability, and growth). After the exponential growth phase, the fermentation enters a stationary phase in which the protein production stops and the batch needs to be harvested.",

            "title": "Implementation of Glycan Remodeling to Plant-Made Therapeutic Antibodies",
            "text": "The cost of monoclonal antibody production remains high despite higher yields in CHO-based manufacture. With antibodies targeted to smaller patient populations and smaller batch sizes, the complexity of facilities, even with single-use technology does not offer substantive economies of scale. CHO glyco-engineering is even more difficult. In some cases, the capital and cost of goods constraints prevent the establishment of antibody manufacturing facilities in developing countries where it is badly needed. The plant transient expression platform using N. benthamiana was chosen as it offers a potential cost-effective alternative to other recombinant protein manufacturing techniques [55,56] to counterbalance the downstream process cost associated with the transglycosylation technology. Successful antibody transglycosylation was described earlier using purified antibodies derived from mammalian cell culture [40,41,57]. However, introducing glycan remodeling into a scalable manufacturing process remained challenging because of the additional cost associated with in vitro deand re-glycosylation, and the introduction of in-process enzymes. An alternative to the in vitro deglycosylation step of the glycan remodeling technology was designed. A combined glycan remodeling process was developed that produced deglycosylated antibody acceptors in vivo, followed by in vitro chemoenzymatic transglycosylation using oxazoline glycans as donors to generate single antibody glycoforms harboring the human afucosylated A2G2 glycan. Furthermore, introducing the deglycosylation step in plant reduces process steps and time, which will significantly reduce cost at scale. To further control cost, oxazoline glycans were chosen as they are derived from raw material available in large quantities (chicken egg yolk powder) and can be prepared at a rather low cost. The large-scale preparation of the sialoglycopeptide (SGP) and the glycan oxazoline derivative was exemplified by two recent reports [53,58]. \n\nMost therapeutic products on the market are well characterized at the amino acid level, but still consist of a pool of several glycoforms and therefore their manufacturing remains under constant regulatory pressure to provide a truly well-characterized protein.",

            "text": "In this review, we discuss the production of four recombinant proteins (hGAD65, NVLPs, 2G12, and hIL-6) which represent heterogeneous pharmaceutical applications, different biochemical features, and a corresponding wide range of production platforms. Table 1 overviews the production of the target proteins in \"traditional\" heterologous expression systems. We have focused not only on the yields achieved in different production systems but also on the unique properties of the manufacturing process for each protein, thus highlighting the advantages of plant-based systems over fermenters for specific niche markets. This leads to the conclusion that plants are potentially most beneficial for the production of four major categories of pharmaceutical proteins: \n\n(1) pharmaceutical proteins required in large quantities, that is, commodity pharmaceutical proteins such as microbicide components; \n\n(2) pharmaceutical proteins that need to be produced rapidly, that is, rapid-response proteins such as vaccines against rapidly evolving viral strains; \n\n(3) biopharmaceuticals that require complex posttranslational modifications, that is, antibodies and recombinant proteins with specific glycan structures; \n\n(4) biopharmaceuticals intended for oral delivery. \n\nOther plant-derived recombinant proteins, beyond the four targets described here, also fit in these categories, for example, vaccines against seasonal virus strains (e.g., fulllength hemagglutinin protein from the A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2) strain of influenza, [110]), personalized vaccines (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vaccines for individual patients, [111]), and proteins carrying specific glycans that increase their efficacy (e.g., human glucocerebrosidase for enzyme replacement therapy, [112]). \n\nThe large-scale production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins is often hampered by the poor expression of their mature, active forms in prokaryotic hosts such as E. coli and by the high costs and the limited scalability of traditional fermenter-based platforms using mammalian cells.",

Since then, an increase in the development of recombinant protein production has taken place to humanize mAbs to increase in vivo safety and efficacy 2,3,4 . Most of the recombinant protein production processes employ Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the ease with which they can be adapted to serum free media, their ability to produce proteins with similar post-translational modifications to that of an innate human protein and their dependability as host cells 5,6 .\n\nDemand is growing to deliver product faster, and for larger patient populations with consistent quality. In addition to the economic benefits, the repertoire of diseases treated by mAbs is increasing, which now includes autoimmune diseases, post-transplantation complications, arthritis, and cancers 7 . Average yields for modern commercial mAb production lines are typically in the range of 5-6 g/L and continue to rise 5 . In part, this has been accomplished through CHO cell engineering and improved production line screening using high-throughput bioreactors 8 . However, most increases in protein production have been attributed to process improvements, including advancements in media optimization, cell culture conditions, and enhanced feeding strategies 7,9,10 . Nutrient supplementation is essential not only for proper cell growth but also for efficient production of high quality protein. Furthermore, cells require the stoichiometric addition of specific nutrients, requiring additional understanding for feeding strategy optimization 6,11 . Traditional optimization methods include individual media component titration and media blending with mixture designs. However, these methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and involve risks associated with human error 12,13 .\n\nMedia optimization studies previously relied on shake flasks and 1-2 L bioreactors which may be prohibitively expensive in terms of raw materials and human capital. Microplates have also been used but these methods provide limited scalability. Furthermore, this may still require multiple time-consuming runs that introduce batch-to-batch variability which obscures the CQA variability caused by media composition and feeding strategy bench-scale bioreactors through their online feedback control of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and acid/base consumption as well as their real-time data output of quality parameters including off gas composition.

            "text": "With the growing competition from biosimilars and the shift towards smaller drug paradigms, companies are seeking cost efficient strategies for biotherapeutics manufacturing. The use of innovative technologies enables the optimization of mAb manufacturing in areas such as cost, throughput, and flexibility. Right-sizing unit operations by using improved perfusion bioreactors, depth filtration, and modern chromatographic strategies allow full use of each process operation's capacity as well as downsizing of equipment and related infrastructure. In this article, an in-depth look at platformable chromatography membrane columns for Protein A capture as well as ion exchange polishing demonstrates equal or better performance than traditional resin columns with much higher productivity; a result of high loading capacities and residence times of only 6 s. A conceptual process integrating stateof-the-art perfusion reactors and these SU membrane columns in a small footprint, modular facility can promote much simpler and faster mAb development and production. \n\nReplacing traditional facilities, or first generation flexible facilities where disposable technologies are implemented in the traditional paradigm, with a truly flexible concept design allows for easy and rapid scale up by increasing the number of cost-efficient production units. Industrial production at lab scale no longer requires technical and regulatory scale-up since these production units can be incorporated into modular clean rooms. This simplifies the replication (cloning) of the process such that manufacturing facilities can be installed anywhere in the world in only a few months (in-market/for-market strategy) with no need to redevelop and characterize the process at larger scale. Truly flexible facilities will experience minimum expenses during clinical phases and grow with market demand, hence minimizing risks while optimizing time to market and global distribution without the challenges of complex worldwide distribution logistics. \n\nThese changes have begun to be implemented in mAb manufacturing but innovation does not have to stop here. Many areas of biologics production, such as vaccine manufacturing where some current facilities are more than 40-50 years old and use outdated, non-optimized technology [35], can benefit from the cost reductions associated with integrating emerging technologies. Despite the current proofs of concept and successful introduction of new techniques in mAb processes, there may be unforeseen challenges when extending flexible manufacturing strategies to other biologics.",

These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

            "text": "The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the world\u2019s capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.",

            "text": "For the case of monoclonal antibody products, our simulations revealed higher Profitability Index for recombinant DNA technology compared to IVT mRNA manufacturing. Although recombinant DNA monoclonal antibodies, due to their inferior potency profile, require higher dose i.e. approximately 10 times that of the IVT mRNA, we find that these elevated mass flow quantities are not reflected analogously on the final production cost. It is furthermore exhibited that IVT mRNA manufacturing demonstrates higher dependencies on raw materials leading to higher end product MSPD values. \n\nFor the study case of antigenic vaccines, recombinant DNA technology demonstrates higher economic performance requiring reduced capital resources, hence the utilisation of bacterial cell factories and the nature of the related downstream processes, ameliorate the use of costly raw material. Moreover, recombinant vaccine manufacturing encompasses proven, well-grounded protocols for both the upstream and downstream process development. Regarding the clinical field, this intervention does not rely on the human body to translate a pro drug to peptides or proteins, unlike the treatments based on IVT mRNA vaccines that stimulate the anticipated immune response only after translation is performed in vivo with all the related risks and pharmacokinetic variations. Whereas demand of supply is stable allowing for planned production, recombinant manufacturing appears advantageous hence it fulfills all the technical and financial expectations delivering proven track records of safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of clinical ambiguity. \n\nWhether large production capacities are required immediately such as in cases of global pandemic outbreaks, IVT mRNA significantly shortens the time required from development to clinical application and from benchtop to scale manufacturing, fostering rapid market penetration. In addition, when product flexibility is required to follow up viral mutations, IVT mRNA manufacturing, due to its synthetic processes and the reduced requirements for installation of large scale production equipment, offers unparalleled advantages. Clinical trials and actual field practice in the future will demonstrate whether mRNA technologies will manage to offer non-inferior therapeutic results compaired to their DNA recombinant established alternatives.",

This is particularly the case for humanized monoclonal antibodies which are the largest and fastest growing class of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. This demand has fostered efforts to improve the efficiency of production as well as to address the quality of the final product. Chinese hamster ovary cells are the predominant hosts for stable transfection and high efficiency production on a large scale. Specific productivity of recombinant glycoproteins from these cells can be expected to be above 50 pg/cell/day giving rise to culture systems with titers of around 5 g/L if appropriate fed-batch systems are employed. Cell engineering can delay the onset of programmed cell death to ensure prolonged maintenance of productive viable cells. The clinical efficacy and quality of the final product can be improved by strategic metabolic engineering. The best example of this is the targeted production of afucosylated antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, an important function for use in cancer therapies. The development of culture media from non-animal sources continues and is important to ensure products of consistent quality and without the potential danger of contamination. Process efficiencies may also be improved by employing disposable bioreactors with the associated minimization of downtime. Finally, advances in downstream processing are needed to handle the increased supply of product from the bioreactor but maintaining the high purity demanded of these biopharmaceuticals.",

A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation. With an ideal dilution rate of 0.015 h-1, their studies found that continuous culture essentially reduced substrate inhibitory effects and preserved the organism in a stronger adaptive condition. Though they remain vulnerable to contamination difficulties, Yi 14 pointed out that continuous fermentation systems run free through constant or occasional injection of fresh nutrient medium without any limits. These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.",

            "text": "The dawn of recombinant engineering came with E. coli expression systems. However, it was overshadowed by eukaryote systems that proved more suitable to express more complex and larger recombinant proteins. The E. coli system is re-emerging for all proteins, including antibodies and soon the full-length ones, as a cost-effective option since the technologies have evolved that make it possible to engineer E. coli to express any protein, bringing down the production cost due to its shorter manufacturing cycle, avoidance of viral contamination, and provide the base material to bring CFPS to reality. E. coli can be designed for continuous manufacturing, a feat not possible a few years ago. Most limitations in the E. coli system have now been well-resolved because of deep knowledge The quest for a CM process has been in the works for several years [162]. While the FDA has yet to approve a biological product manufactured in a continuous system, it anticipates much interest. As a result, in March 2023, the FDA released its first guidance on CM [163] addressing the scientific and regulatory issues, including the eCTD filing structure, which arose during the designing, installation, operation, and lifecycle management of CM for chemical and biological drugs. This guideline has opened the path to continuous systems over batch systems that will significantly impact the development and production cost, stability of proteins, and a significant reduction in the size of the bioreactors. Figure 2 shows a manufacturing flow in a CM for a therapeutic protein. The FDA also identifies other guidelines that control CM. The recombinant protein technology batch process is the industry standard. However, proteins can also be produced in a vessel, from which the yield is continuously removed, provided the protein is secreted into the culture medium. It helps to improve the yield of labile proteins and prevents inconsistent PTMs while maintaining cells at higher viabilities and critical factors [164]. Besides the material costs, the reduced testing also adds significant savings.",

            "text": "In particular, Handlogten et al. described the speedy manufacturing of tixagevimab & cilgavimab from clonal cell lines without the typical evaluations of cell line stability. Of note, the speed to clinics was considered to outweigh potential risks of increased cost of goods manufactured (COG) that might result from a cell line with low population doubling level limit that could impede the scalability to larger manufacturing scales [18]. Furthermore, advanced expression technology such as targeted integration may eventually obsolete the cell line stability study for all biologics development [14,[27][28][29][30]. \n\nFollowing MCB creation, the next milestone on critical path to IND is GMP production of drug substance. Prior to release of MCB into a GMP production facility, conventional industry practice requires biosafety tests to be performed on MCB to prevent potential crosscontamination, which will instigate costly and timeconsuming efforts in decontamination, investigation and 98 Antibody Therapeutics, 2024  [23]. \n\nAnother important feature enabling the acceleration of CMC timeline is the leverage of proven platform technologies and processes to minimize the lead times of various process development and manufacturing activities. Process development activities for biologics generally include upstream, downstream, analytical method and formulation development, while manufacturing activities commonly encompass non-GMP pilot production, GMP drug substance production and GMP drug product production and filling. The use of proven platform technologies can shorten these activities into simplistic performance and feasibility checks, without multiple rounds of sequential workflows typically performed in a traditional CMC program. For instance, Regeneron emphasized the importance of prior knowledge and platform aspects in upstream and downstream processes to achieve rapid upstream process transfers and optimization of downstream purification steps of casirivimab and imdevimab [24]. Leveraging prior downstream knowledge, screening of chromatographical process parameters were performed within a development window of only several days between the first research batch and the toxicological batch. The toxicological batch was subsequently used as the only downstream process verification batch before the production of first-in-human clinical material.",

            "text": "The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the world's capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technologybased solutions. In this work, we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies, we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies, we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT To enable large-scale antibody production, the creation of a stable, high producer cell line is essential. This process often takes longer than 6 months using standard limited dilution techniques and is very labor intensive. The use of a tri-cistronic vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and both antibody chains, separated by a GT2A peptide sequence, allows expression of all proteins under a single promotor in equimolar ratios. By combining the advantages of 2A peptide cleavage and single cell sorting, a chimeric antibody-antigen fusion protein that contained the variable domains of mouse IgG with a porcine IgA constant domain fused to the FedF antigen could be produced in CHO-K1 cells. After transfection, a strong correlation was found between antibody production and GFP expression (r = 0.69) using image analysis of formed monolayer patches. This enables the rapid selection of GFP-positive clones using automated image analysis for the selection of high producer clones. This vector design allowed the rapid selection of high producer clones within a time-frame of 4 weeks after transfection. The highest producing clone had a specific antibody productivity of 2.32 pg/cell/day. Concentrations of 34 mg/L were obtained using shake-flask batch culture. The produced recombinant antibody showed stable expression, binding and minimal degradation. In the future, this antibody will be assessed for its effectiveness as an oral vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "Conventionally, hyperimmune globulin drugs manufactured from pooled immunoglobulins from vaccinated or convalescent donors have been used in treating infections where no treatment is available. This is especially important where multi-epitope neutralization is required to prevent the development of immune-evading viral mutants that can emerge upon treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Using microfluidics, flow sorting, and a targeted integration cell line, a first-in-class recombinant hyperimmune globulin therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 (GIGA-2050) was generated. Using processes similar to conventional monoclonal antibody manufacturing, GIGA-2050, comprising 12,500 antibodies, was scaled-up for clinical manufacturing and multiple development/tox lots were assessed for consistency. Antibody sequence diversity, cell growth, productivity, and product quality were assessed across different manufacturing sites and production scales. GIGA-2050 was purified and tested for good laboratory procedures (GLP) toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. The GIGA-2050 master cell bank was highly stable, producing material at consistent yield and product quality up to >70 generations. Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and development batches of GIGA-2050 showed consistent product quality, impurity clearance, potency, and protection in an in vivo efficacy model. Nonhuman primate toxicology and pharmacokinetics studies suggest that GIGA-2050 is safe and has a half-life similar to other recombinant human IgG1 antibodies. These results supported a successful investigational new drug application for GIGA-2050. This study demonstrates that a new class of drugs, recombinant hyperimmune globulins, can be manufactured consistently at the clinical scale and presents a new approach to treating infectious diseases that targets multiple epitopes of a virus.",

            "text": "Industrial-scale production of many biotherapeutics relies on the culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In fed-batch cultures, nutrients are added to the culture to prevent nutrient limitation, prolong culture duration, and maximize product titer. Once culture viability drops below a certain threshold, the culture is harvested and the product is purified. Advances in cell engineering, expression vector design, and process development have allowed monoclonal antibody (mAb) titers to reach 10 g/L. However, high expression of recombinant genes places a large metabolic burden on the cell, which can result in the downregulation of recombinant gene expression. To avoid unstable cell lines entering the manufacturing stage, stability studies (which remain a significant bottleneck in cell line development timelines) are performed to identify cell lines that maintain high gene expression over the culture period. Additionally, a growing range of next-generation biotherapeutics (such as bi-specific antibodies, fusion proteins, and toxic proteins) are being produced as a result of recent developments in protein engineering. These are often difficult to express in CHO cells at desired quantities. For example, production of hyperactive human DNase I is particularly challenging with standard culture processes, because protein expression negatively impacts cell growth, viability, and stability (Lam et al., 2017). \n\nAn increasingly attractive method of production is to decouple the growth and production phases of the culture process, usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy (Misaghi et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2017;Poulain et al., 2017). Under such a system, cells are initially grown up to high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase). Once the desired cell density is reached, expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation is halted (the production phase). Proliferation is usually arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is associated with larger cells and increased ribosomal protein S6 levels (Carvalhal et al., 2003;Bi et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the production of full-size immunoglobulins remains a challenge. Compared to yeasts, filamentous fungi are more difficult for the generation of transformed clones, but they have a long tradition for the usage in biotechnology and they have partially been used for the expression of IgGs. In contrast, the development of protozoa as an expression system for recombinant proteins and antibodies has just been started and is still in a developmental stage. However, the mammalian-like glycosylation pattern presents them a promising candidate for further exploitation. \n\nInsect cells contain a better suited protein folding and secretion apparatus than prokaryotes. Their high robustness combined with less sophisticated requirements for fermentation provide some advantages compared to mammalian cells. However, the development of stable insect cell lines and process technology is not developed as far. Consequently, mammalian cell lines are most widely used for the production of therapeutic antibodies as they provide a sophisticated folding and secretion apparatus as well as human-like glycosylation. For the production of high levels of recombinant antibodies high technical efforts are needed leading to relatively high costs. The maximum reported yield of functional IgG was 5 g/L which cannot be achieved using other expression systems so far, but up-scaling of the production does not lead to a high reduction of the production costs. \n\nFor an efficient reduction of production costs, transgenic plants can be used as they represent a highly scalable expression system; cultivation can be easily expanded without a gross increase in costs. In contrast, the generation of transgenic plants remains very complex and difficult. The most important obstacle of transgenic plants is the downstream processing as tons of plant material may have to be processed. However, antibody production in milk or eggs of animals would also be highly scalable and permits easy downstream processing. Several livestock animal species have been developed for the expression of recombinant proteins, but generation of transgenic animals also is very laborious. An interesting approach is the combination of human transgenic animals with hybridoma technology for the development of human antibodies. \n\nIn principle, there is no \"universal\" production system which can guarantee high yields of recombinant antibody, particularly as every antibody-based molecule itself will cause its own issues in terms of expression.",

            "text": "These antibody fragments show better tissue penetration and are less immunogenic to the human body in comparison to the full antibody. Recently, ESETEC secretion technology (Wacker Biotech) has been developed to secrete recombinant products into the culture broth during fermentation and resulted in a high yield of Fab (exceeding 4.0 g/l) and of scFv (up to 3.5 g/l) (Gupta and Shukla, 2017b). In another study, it was shown that the optimization of antibody fragment production was accompanied by the alleviation of stress production in the periplasm of E. coli. Thus, the monitoring of stress responses could be used to facilitate enhanced recombinant protein production yields (Baumgarten et al., 2018). Overexpression of membrane protein in E. coli may lead to toxicity and low yields of the active protein product. Snijder and Hakulinen (2016) described the challenges associated with overexpression of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins and different approaches to overcoming these challenges as well as a detailed protocol to express and screen membrane proteins using a His-specific fluorescent probe and fluorescent size-exclusion chromatography. Strategies for the production of soluble recombinant proteins using E. coli were described in another study (Gurramkonda et al., 2018). The latest advances in recombinant protein expression in E. coli were also described recently (Rosano et al., 2019). \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 has been used to successfully carry out the chromosomal integration of large DNA into E. coli and was also able to integrate functional genes in diverse E. coli strains (Chung et al., 2017). In a recent study, it was also reported that CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing offered a simple strategy for efficient genetic engineering in E. coli (Huang et al., 2019). The existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in bacteria were also described in a recent review (Vento et al., 2019).",

However, it was overshadowed by eukaryote systems that proved more suitable to express more complex and larger recombinant proteins. The E. coli system is re-emerging for all proteins, including antibodies and soon the full-length ones, as a cost-effective option since the technologies have evolved that make it possible to engineer E. coli to express any protein, bringing down the production cost due to its shorter manufacturing cycle, avoidance of viral contamination, and provide the base material to bring CFPS to reality. E. coli can be designed for continuous manufacturing, a feat not possible a few years ago. Most limitations in the E. coli system have now been well-resolved because of deep knowledge about the E. coli; many technologies, including the updated BL21(DE3) genome, novel engineering, AI-based molecular docking, sensitive analytics, accurate optimization and fusing several engineering and mathematical tools; and many innovations that were not available to reference product when it was developed, likely 25 years ago [165]. The suggestions made in this paper should encourage both the developers of new biologics and biosimilars to consider adopting these improved and more recent technologies to help",

            "text": "Antibodies (Abs) are the workhorses of biomedical research. Enhancing the research community's access to extensively validated Abs remains an important goal of antibody developers in both academia and industry (Taussig et al., 2018). This has been the topic of a number of recent conferences and commentaries, led to changes in journal practices as related to transparent reporting of antibody-based research including the use of Research Resource Identifiers or RRIDs, and resulted in large-scale NIH and EU Ab development initiatives (e.g., the NIH Common Fund Protein Capture Reagent Program, the EU Affinomics Program). It is widely recognized that production of Abs in a renewable form, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), represents a substantial advance over polyclonal Abs from antisera that are available in finite quantity, and that comprise a heterogeneous and less definable population of Abs (Harlow and Lane, 1988;Greenfield, 2014;Busby et al., 2016). Having mAbs available in recombinant form as recombinant mAbs (R-mAbs) offers numerous additional advantages (Bradbury and Pl\u00fcckthun, 2015). Recombinant expression systems allow for the reliable production of an R-mAb not prone to loss by genetic instability of tetra-or hexa-ploid hybridoma cells or other factors (Andreeff et al., 1985;Barnes et al., 2003). Moreover, unlike hybridoma cell lines that can express multiple functional heavy and light immunoglobulin chains (Zack et al., 1995;Blatt et al., 1998;Bradbury et al., 2018), recombinant expression ensures production of a single, molecularly defined R-mAb. Recombinant expression can also yield production levels hundreds or even thousands of times higher than is possible with endogenous expressions of mAbs from hybridoma cells (e.g., Backliwal et al., 2008;Fischer et al., 2015;Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). Furthermore, the cloning of R-mAbs provides for permanent, dependable and inexpensive archiving of the R-mAb as plasmid DNA and nucleic acid sequences versus an archiving system relying on",

The potential of these particles has been demonstrated by the approval of several products, in the different fields of gene therapy, oncolytic therapy, and tumor vaccines. However, their manufacturing still presents challenges related to the high dosages and purity required. Areas covered: The main challenges that biopharmaceutical industry faces today and the most recent developments in the manufacturing of different biotherapeutic particles are reported here. Several unit operations and downstream trains to purify virus, virus-like particles and extracellular vesicles are described. Innovations on the different purification steps are also highlighted with an eye on the implementation of continuous and integrated processes. Expert opinion: Manufacturing platforms that consist of a low number of unit operations, with higher-yielding processes and reduced costs will be highly appreciated by the industry. The pipeline of complex therapeutic particles is expanding and there is a clear need for advanced tools and manufacturing capacity. The use of single-use technologies, as well as continuous integrated operations, are gaining ground in the biopharmaceutical industry and should be supported by more accurate and faster analytical methods.",

The latter is simple, inexpensive and can be operated under safe operating conditions and has been used successfully with several mAbs and Fc fusion proteins (dissolution rates to >50 g/L, product quality maintained), with yields >90% achievable in less than one day in some cases. In the near term, facility limitations can be overcome by a combination of operational or engineering approaches and process improvements (current technology or those easily implemented in existing facilities). Chromatography and filtration are not technology limiting up to the 10 ton scale. 1 Longer term advances in expanded bed adsorption and simultaneous multi-column chromatography systems (SMCC), new resins for Protein A and polishing steps may offer benefits. The drivers for change include increased plant throughput, process productivity and facility utilization to enable more product mass per unit time and a reduction in COGs. \n\nHave state-of-the-art mAb production processes already succeeded in disrupting our industry? This was the key question that Brian Kelley (Genentech) posed in his thought-provoking presentation. Twelve years ago there was only one licensed recombinant mAb (rituximab), novel procceses yielded low titers and capacity concerns led to the development of alternate hosts and installation of large (12,000L) productions tanks. Today, over 20 mAbs are approved, many plants can produce multiple products (25kL max) and all marketed mAbs as well as Fc fusion proteins are derived from mammalian cell cultures with 2-5 g/L titers. \n\nProduction batch sizes utilizing platform processes range from 50-100 kg and capacity concerns have been addressed by the installation of tanks up 25,000L (total two million L in 2006, with selection of polypeptide sequences for protein purification from phage display libraries. 4",

For example, transient expression with deconstructed viral vectors allows production of up to 5 milligrams of monoclonal antibody per gram of fresh leaf weight within 2 weeks (Hefferon 2012). Other advances have looked at the development of inducible viral systems in which deconstructed viruses cannot spread systemically. \n\nTo produce the 10 grams of antibodies needed for a single course of ZMapp immunization, Mapp Biopharmaceutical currently requires 30 to 50 kilograms of tobacco leaves. If tobacco plants could be engineered to produce antibodies more efficiently, that volume could be reduced to about 10 kilograms (Healy 2014). In fact, there are many challenges from logistical, regulatory, and economic aspects to largescale production and use in the case of ZMapp. When the Ebola outbreak was threatening, Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. government) promptly devoted $24.9 million over 18 months to help San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. accelerate production. \n\nTransient expression technology with deconstructed viral vectors has considerable advantages over processes that require generation and selection of transgenic plants, which can take months to years (Chen and Davis 2016). The rapid and high-level protein production capability of transient expression technology makes it an optimal system to produce milligram and gram levels of biologics for preclinical studies. Despite the advantages of a transient expression system, large-scale production using a greenhouse is still limited and therefore relatively expensive. Agrobacteria is more expensive and can accommodate only limited volumes of plant materials. \n\nTherefore, this intermediated version of deconstructed viral vectors have been further studied for the development of a scaled-up manufacturing system of biologics in stable transgenic plants, the production of which often results in low and inconsistent protein yield. Inducible expression of recombinant proteins with deconstructed viral vectors and chemical inducers can be used for yield optimization, as it allows separation of the growth and production phases in manufacturing.",

            "text": "\u25a0 What issues are important to consider for large-scale manufacture of mAbs? J.G.: US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci estimates that the United States will require 40 million doses of a COVID-19 antibody therapy, and an analysis of hospitalizations suggests that over 2.5 million doses per month would be likely required globally for the urgent care setting alone. Even with 30,000-liter reactors operating continuously at multiple facilities, there will be a problem of supply. In addition to production, there are problems of national availability. An excessive focus on US supply could leave many areas of the world unprotected, as appears to be the case already with vaccines. International partnerships for manufacturing and distribution, as well as exploration of other manufacturing platforms, will be required to address this global need. \n\nAt Centivax, to maximize the manufacture of our Centi-B9 (a monoclonal IgG1 with LALA and LS mutations and thermostability optimization to enable better expression and concentration for subcutaneous injection delivery), we optimized yield in mammalian (at ATUM and Millipore), bacteria (at SwiftScale), and fungal expression systems. Although some of these systems require additional INDs [Investigational New Drug applications], a multiplatform manufacturing strategy enables a dramatic increase in the number of doses that can be manufactured, and therefore a decrease in the cost per dose that can be offered to global markets. The different expression systems offer a balance of established CHO production versus potential advantages of the newer but less established platforms (availability of capacity, speed, cost of goods, and scale). \n\nPrefilled fixed-dose syringes are convenient for distribution and can be administered outside of a hospital setting, but are limited in application to postexposure prophylaxis and early-stage disease due to their lower dose. Bioengineering methods can be used to optimize antibodies to better tolerate the high concentrations necessary for effective subcutaneous injection. In general, it is my hope that the pandemic will usher in a renaissance of biologics manufacturing technologies to the general benefit of all medicines made thereafter.",

            "text": "Several recombinant mAbs and antibody cocktails against COVID-19 are currently undergoing clinical development for therapeutic and prophylactic applications, including REGN-CoV-2 (Regeneron Therapeutics, Phase III), CSL312 (CSL Behring, Phase II), LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly/AbCellera, Phase III), and TYO27 (Tychan, Phase I; Marovich et al., 2020). Many of the mAbs in development target the S-protein, aiming to block interactions with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Efforts to exploit convalescent sera from patients who recovered from COVID-19 have helped identify antibodies with neutralizing potential. For example, Eli Lilly/ AbCellera identified such an antibody in a blood sample from one of the first United States patients who recovered from the disease. The mAb was developed into LY-CoV555, a potent, neutralizing IgG1 that binds the S protein. In collaboration with NIAID, the product began Phase III clinical evaluation in high-risk assisted living facilities in August 2020. 21 Most COVID-19 antibody products in development are produced in mammalian cells, but antibodies were among the first products of molecular farming in plants (Hiatt et al., 1989) and many different mAb products have been expressed, including complex secretory IgA (Wycoff, 2005). The dose of a mAb or mAb cocktail needed for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 is currently unclear. About 9 g of the ZMapp cocktail was needed per treatment against Ebola virus and in a subsequent clinical study (Davey et al., 2016), but that dose level was selected from the outcome of studies in non-human primates (animal rule), which enabled rapid deployment under the compassionate use protocol and did not benefit from dose optimization studies in humans. Assuming similar doses, manufacturing scalability is likely to be a key challenge in the production of COVID-19 antibodies. The scaling up of conventional bioreactors is particularly challenging due to changes in mixing, mass transfer, and heat exchange, whereas transient expression in plants can be scaled in a linear manner because each plant is effectively an independent bioreactor, equating to a process",

            "text": "Reported titers from transient transfections of mammalian cells, small scale or large scale, are at minimum 1 log lower than those reported from stably transfected, optimized cell lines used in manufacturing of recombinant proteins in bioreactors. Here, we report a method that brings transient expression titers into the range of those   of stable cell lines. In addition the timeline to establish such a process is short and can be reproduced in a matter of days, not months (as is the standard for stable production). Our method will be useful in many areas of basic and applied biotechnology research, where large amounts of different proteins will have to be produced in a short period of time such as proteomics applications or screening of antibody leads. Due to the speed of establishment of high level production, once the appropriate conditions have been assembled, our protocol will enable certain biodefense applications, where an antibody or vaccine will have to be produced in large quantities within weeks. One could even imagine scenarios in which proteins are regularly produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP) conditions by means of transient transfectioneliminating the time-consuming steps of establishing and banking stable cell lines and performing process development for each individual clone.\n\nFurthermore, instead of purchasing expensive growth factors, growth factors can be expressed in situ. Transient gene expression also allows for the introduction of factors into mammalian cells that are incompatible with long-term cell survival or biomass expansion (such as p18 or p21) without the need for a tight, inducible gene expression system: as biomass expansion takes place prior to transfection, there are no limitations of this kind. Indeed, one can independently optimize each step of the manufacturing cycle, from biomass expansion via transfection to protein production.\n\nIn summary, our scalable expression system yields titers of up to 1 g/l with recovery of more than 1 g of Protein A purified antibody at the 2-l scale, performs similarly for other recombinant proteins and significantly increases titers also in other vector contexts to the extent that preclinical experiments become feasible. We are optimistic that the XLG protocol will further accelerate the development of biotechnology drugs and lead to a paradigm shift in manufacture of recombinant proteins for commercial use.",

Preparedness for all biological catastrophes requires a radical solution to replace the current slow scale-up and manufacture of certain lifesaving medical countermeasures. Current clinical and commercial manufacturing methods for glycosylated proteins use stable cell lines for protein expression, wherein the gene coding for the protein of interest is stably integrated into the host cell genome. The generation, identification, banking, testing, and scale-up of suitable stable clones generally takes many months. Because this development time is not compatible with emergency manufacturing, an alternative method for rapid production of medical counter measure antibodies is needed. One such potential technique is transient gene expression. Transient gene expression is a common approach for production of research-grade antibodies. It is frequently used to generate milligram to gram quantities of material within two to three weeks of DNA sequence confirmation. In the past, transient systems have been considered for emergency production of large quantities of antibodies, but dismissed due to low titers, high cost of DNA, uncertain regulatory environment, and the lack of sufficient, available manufacturing capacity. Recent developments, however, have substantially enhanced the viability of such an approach. This article will explore these developments and investigate the use of transient gene expression for rapid production of antibody-based medical countermeasures.",

            "text": "Since the approval of the first licensed monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, the demand for mAbs as therapeutic agents has developed into a multi-billion dollar per year market (Liu, 2014). Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch & Racher, 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012). \n\nAs the demand for therapeutic mAb production increased, key improvements were made in the areas of safety, efficacy, and quality (Dimitrov, 2012), among which the utilization of scale down systems to investigate process robustness played an important role (Kochanowski & Malphettes, 2013). Automated single use microscale bioreactor systems were evaluated as a model for large scale fed-batch bioprocessing systems (Hsu, Aulakh, Traul, & Yuk, 2012;Moses, Manahan, Ambrogelly, & Ling, 2012;Nienow et al., 2013). Microscale bioreactors were reported to shorten the timeline towards commercial production by allowing multifactorial process optimization, in line with the current Quality by Design guidelines (FDA, 2008). pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) could be accurately controlled both in microscale and in large scale (Rameez, Mostafa, Miller, & Shukla, 2014). Informing process control at large scale involves an extensive understanding of the physical characteristics and limitations of the system investigated at microscale (Nienow et al., 2013).",

The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.",

            "text": "The bioprocessing industry at a crossroads Manufacturing processes for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have evolved tremendously since the first licensed mAb product in 1986. The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies. which would generate batches of 15-100 kg from 10 kL-25 kL bioreactors. Large manufacturing plants are designed with multiple bioreactors supplying one (or sometimes two) purification train(s). The individual purification unit operations can be completed in under two days, and often in just one day, and therefore several bioreactors can be matched to the output of a single purification train. The increased capacity of these plants arising from the elevated titers will decrease the drug substance COGs, by virtue of the economies of scale afforded by the large bioreactors. As will be described in more detail below, these plants are capable of producing enormous quantities of mAbs with very attractive costs.\n\nFurther, this consensus manufacturing process is amenable to standardization that establishes a common processing platform for many mAbs. Each company is likely to use a slightly different platform process, but the similarities outweigh the differences when it comes to the process flowsheet ( Fig. 1) and the typical manufacturing plant design. The use of a platform approach reduces the investment per mAb product candidate, streamlines development efforts, simplifies raw material procurement and warehousing, and reduces scale-up and technology transfer complexities. Several companies have revealed that they have very similar development timelines from the start of cell line development through first-in-human clinical trials, and many are using common tools",

            "text": "[19]. This reduces the predictive value, complicates procedures and increases the cost of therapeutic glycoprotein production, besides making it tougher to distinguish between wild-type and mutant reporters [20]. There are numerous approaches to generate stable expressing cell lines while eliminating clonal variance. They include the use of site-specific recombinases, which comprises of Cre and Flp, as well as homologous recombination, which for example comprises of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Although the latest technologies include combining a few of the prior mentioned systems to provide a system without any limitations that come with exploiting just a system. For instance, the novel \"Cas-Pi\" system, which means cascaded precise integration and the usage of hybrid enzymes such as Flp-TAL recombinases [21,22]. Furthermore, there are strategies to be adopted to increase antibody yield. The expression vector can be designed to increase expression with high expressing promoters such as pCMV or pCNA [23]. Cell culture temperature, which is slightly hypothermic was proven to cause a rise in transgene expression [15]. Furthermore, hyperosmolality which can be achieved with either continued supplementation of feeds and build-up of metabolic waste or salt supplementation can increase gene expression levels [24]. There is an increase in specific volumetric productivity when the cells are at their largest [25]. Lastly, downstream processing is the last step in antibody production and choice of purification system determines the quality of the final antibody product.\n\nAll in all, this review highlights the importance of antibodies and several strategies to increase mass production in a time efficient and cost-effective manner. However, there is still limited data to verify the effectiveness of the aforementioned strategies and more studies can be done to consolidate these systems for industrial production. It is undeniable that there will be more strategies, systems, and pipelines expanded to further improve biopharmaceutical production.",

There are considerable regulatory challenges to consider in commercialization of plant\u2010made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), some of which are inherent to plant\u2010production systems and others that are common with other production systems, but are new to PMPs because of the youth of the industry. In this review, we discuss our recent and ongoing experience with bulk production of the HIV microbicide candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), utilizing plant\u2010based transient protein expression, with specific focus on areas relevant to commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Analytical programs have been developed for the qualification and monitoring of both the expression vector system and the API detailing our experience and plans for each. Monitoring postpurification protein modifications are discussed in relation to stability and safety programs. Expression, processing and analytics programs are associated with increased manufacturing costs in current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production because of the required qualification testing. The impact of these costs on the overall cost of goods is particularly relevant to GRFT manufacturing because GRFT, as an HIV microbicide, is most needed in populations at high risk for HIV exposure in resource\u2010poor countries. Consequently, GRFT for microbicide applications is a very cost\u2010sensitive recombinant PMP. We have therefore emphasized maintaining a low cost of goods. We provide a review of the literature on the economics of PMPs with various expression systems and how they may impact production costs and complexity.",

            "text": "Attaining an optimum formulation for a recombinant protein could be influenced by different factors [23,24].Since one of the biggest concerns of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing is the cost-effectiveness and repeatability of the recombinant protein production process, chemically defined-minimal media as excellent solutions can be used to achieve these two goals [25,26].Several studies have attempted to achieve maximal production under optimal conditions.Despite the constructive benefits of utilizing E. coli, high-level synthesis of soluble recombinant proteins can be challenging.Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27].In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29].Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins.For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30].According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed.Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction.Nonetheless, efforts to identify optimal buffer conditions frequently rely on re-purification or functional assays, a time-and protein-intensive trial-and-error strategy.An optimal time window exists for the production of proteins.The correlation between the growth rate and the specific protein production rate for the induced batch and fed-batch cultures suggests that a sluggish growth rate under induced conditions produces little or no product.In addition, the duration of expression was limited in batch cultures.This provides information on protein aggregation in the cell and protein quality [31].Induction is typically conducted during the early mid-log phase, although there are reports of induction occurring during the late-log phase or even during the stationary phase [32].The recombinant nature of protein drugs allows intervening at upstream stages through protein engineering to produce analogue protein versions with higher stability and enhanced therapeutic values.This highlights the importance of protein engineering and structural analysis in improving the stability of recombinant proteins such as BlaR-CTD.",

            "text": "It is impossible to predict future variants of SARS-CoV-2, so drugs that are robust over the long term should have extremely broad epitope coverage. \n\nPreviously, we generated the world's first highly diverse, recombinant hyperimmune globulins; using a high-throughput single B cell capture microfluidic technology, diverse antibody repertoires from COVID-19 convalescent donors were captured and antibody sequences were cloned and expressed in a targeted integration Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line [12]. Upstream and downstream processes were developed based on standard mAb manufacturing, to allow for use of existing manufacturing infrastructure (Figure 1). The recombinant hyperimmune globulin drug product, GIGA-2050, is currently in clinical trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States (US). We previously demonstrated that GIGA-2050 comprises 12,500 unique antibodies and binds to a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants [12], like plasma hyperimmune globulins for COVID-19; a detailed study of the ability of GIGA-2050 to neutralize all major variants of concern is underway (manuscript in preparation). \n\nIn this current study, we describe the manufacturing controls, pharmacological assessments, and in vivo studies used to support an investigational new drug (IND) application. To assess consistency across batches and upstream process scalability, the CHO cells were monitored for cell viability, antibody production titers, and sequence diversity. Additionally, each GIGA-2050 lot was tested for purity and product quality, including potency using a SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and a cell-based pseudovirus neutralization assay. This work demonstrates that a recombinant hyperimmune globulin can be manufactured under GMP at up to 250 L scale, leveraging equipment and methods used in conventional mAb manufacturing, and that such a process was comparable across multiple lots.",

            "text": "The conventional production of pharmaceutical proteins or other biologics consists of multiple steps from raw materials to finished products. As biologics need to maintain stringent quality control, multiple steps in production facilities compromise the product quality significantly. They also reduce productivity and become prone to human errors, which decrease product efficacy and safety. Moreover, multiple steps in cell processing consume a lot of time, which indirectly increases production cost. To overcome these drawbacks, integrated pharmaceutical production has been attempted by various pharmaceutical companies. One of the significant attempts was made by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing of pharmaceutical products to fully integrate the cell processing system [50,51]. Another attempt was taken by Genzyme\u2122 for continuous production of pharmaceutical recombinant protein in bioreactors, where cell culture to product isolation and purification was integrated in a single flow [52]. By using this system, they respectively reported successful production of monoclonal antibody as well as highly complex, less stable pharmaceutical protein with consistent product quality, high product output, and low cost. Process integrity is necessary for reducing cumbersome production steps and cutting cost significantly. One such integrated system developed by Johnson & Johnson has recently got FDA approval for largescale HIV drug production [53] that reduces time and cost by one third compared to the conventional batch processing.\n\nSince biologics production for cell therapies require multiple steps, integration of all of the steps will give high product quality and safety, as well as help overcome stringent regulatory requirements. In this context, we will discuss how to integrate some important basic steps of cell manufacturing especially genetic modification, cellular reprogramming, expansion, and differentiation in bioreactors to promote a single-step approach for cell-based therapies (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Since the 1970s, the methodologies available for generating Mabs have dramatically evolved from the hybridoma technology used to produce murine Mabs (Kohler and Milstein, 1975) to sophisticated recombinant engineering technologies (Br\u00fcggemann et al., 1989a,b;Steinitz et al., 1977) appropriate to design specific Mabs of choice, thus producing humanized, chimeric, and completely (fully) human Mabs (Fig. 25.3) (Br\u00fcggemann et al., 1989a,b;Jones et al., 1986;Lonberg, 2005;Riechmann et al., 1998).\n\nThese novel methods have had major consequences in the development of clinically applicable Mabs against disease targets. The immunogenicity and safety of Mabs, a substantial limitation of antibodies produced by the hybridoma technology, could be overcome, and Mabs against any antigen specificity and with desirable physicochemical properties could be developed. High-scale production of Mabs at the industrial level could further be achieved. This has sparked a race for the development of antibody-mediated therapeutics in the clinic with the investment of large amounts of money from the biopharmaceutical sector toward that end, which is already paying off. The major success of human Mabs in immune and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, spondyloarthropathies, juvenile arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and others (Andreakos et al., 2002), marks merely the beginning of a rapidly evolving field with more than 150 diverse Mabs currently being evaluated in clinical trials or being candidates for approval by the FDA in the USA.\n\nScaling up Mabs production for therapeutics posed several challenges. The major issue was how to produce high quantities of drugs at a reasonable cost. Most cell lines in the 1980s yielded only half a gram of Mabs per liter, so production was time consuming and expensive. The ideal was to develop FIGURE 25.2 Monoclonal Antibody Rituximab 3 ANTIBODY-DRUG CONjUGATES a hybrid cell line that could produce between 5 and 10 g of Mabs per liter. This demanded several steps, and even more, each requiring skill and patience.",

            "text": "challenge in the production of COVID-19 antibodies. The scaling up of conventional bioreactors is particularly challenging due to changes in mixing, mass transfer, and heat exchange, whereas transient expression in plants can be scaled in a linear manner because each plant is effectively an independent bioreactor, equating to a process of numbering up by increasing the plant inventory and throughput of the facility. Similarly, cost will be an important consideration. In 2013, total sales of mAbs produced in mammalian cell bioreactors amounted to ~\u20ac48.5 (US$57) billion for 8,182 kg of product, with an average sales price of ~\u20ac5,957 ($7,000) g \u22121 (Ecker et al., 2015). Production costs and capital expenses for the transient expression of mAbs in plants are estimated to be at least 50% lower than mammalian cell culture production facilities (Nandi et al., 2016), allowing manufacturers to reduce sales prices while still making some profit or providing these therapeutics at cost, and saving taxpayer resources.",

There are many effective avenues for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins; however, the main challenge lies in achieving cost-effective production on a large scale. Over the past five years the potential for using plants as bioreactors has become well established. Plant systems offer several advantages: they are economical, using low-cost inputs such as light, water and miner-als; they are easily adaptable to large-scale operations (by growing more plants); they possess minimal risk of contamination with potential human pathogens; the products may not require purification and pharmaceuticals produced this way can be given mucosally, hence simplifying delivery and decreasing overall cost.\n\nPlant-derived pharmaceuticals can be categorized into three areas: antibodies, biopharmaceuticals, and vaccines. Plant-derived antibodies, also referred to as plantibodies, have extensive uses in many areas including bioremediation, disease resistance in plants and industrial purification processes. The most advanced application of plantibodies, however, is the production of antibodies for medical use. Stoger and colleagues [1] provided a recent review on plant-derived antibodies.\n\nThere have been many reports of biopharmaceutical expression in plants and these proteins have a diverse range of applications [2-9] (see Table 1). In general, however, expression levels of these plant-derived biopharmaceuticals need to be increased before commercial production can be accomplished [10].\n\nIn the past 12 years, substantial research has shown that plant-derived vaccines are feasible commodities. Walmsley and Arntzen give a general description of this technology and its early development [11]. This review highlights the advances made in the past three years and the future directions for the development of plantderived vaccines.",

            "text": "Biologics are known to be rather complex products. Apparently small changes in the manufacturing processes can cause significant differences in their clinical properties. Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high. \n\nThis fact was recognized by the FDA. The agency responded with a couple of measures. One essential reaction is FDA's PAT initiative [2]. With PAT, improvements in pharmaceutical and biologics production processes with respect to real time automated process monitoring and control are demanded. A rigorous science-based approach to manufacturing is demanded, as better understanding is thought to lead to more efficient process control, lower process variability, thus high product quality and finally patient safety. For biologics it is particularly important to keep the processes under control early in the product synthesis process (e.g., [1]). \n\nIn bioprocess engineering, process monitoring and control is being developed since many years. A review was given by Lee et al. [8]. The objective was to keep the process on trajectories that finally lead to a high value of the desired mass m P of the product. Within a more or less well-defined production time t P , this can be related to biomass by the following expression: \n\nwhere p is the specific product formation rate and x the total biomass. Both arguments of the integral are functions of time, but more importantly, both are primarily dependent on the specific biomass growth rate l in most industrial production systems.",

            "text": "Recent advances in cell and gene therapy along with accelerated pathways have compressed timelines for developing commercial manufacturing processes for viral vectors. As demand for cell therapy products continue to rise, there is a growing question around the availability of vectors at the right quality, cost, and scale. Viral vector manufacturing alone is its own science and in combination with cell therapy adds further complication to an already challenging process. Due to the large numbers of containers required to meet the requirements for a GMP clinical run, developers have traditionally used scale-out approaches to address demand using conventional adherent-cell systems (T-flasks, multi-layer flasks, and roller bottles). Besides space concerns, the use of increased numbers of culture vessels results in increased processing time and open manipulation steps which increases contamination risk during aseptic processing. A number of alternatives systems are available that are larger and allow for mostly closed processing including single-use bioreactor systems such as stirred tank reactors, commonly utilized in antibody production, and perfusion cultures. The Quantum Cell Expansion System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood CO) is a functionally closed and automated system using hollow fiber technology and has shown to produce lentiviral vector yields upwards to 4x10 9 vg per run 74 . The iCellis \u00ae single-use fixed-bed reactor (Pall Corporation; Port Washington, New York) offers another automated system that has both small-and large-scale options for vector manufacturing. \n\nDuring production, downstream processing constraints such as labor intensity and scalability issues surround ultracentrifugation, which is still widely used for viral vector preparation for Phase I level work. There is a trend to move away from non-scalable strategies, although the lack of clarity around the quantity of vector required for dosing makes this challenging. However, with patient numbers increasing as they progress through their clinical program, and with more products moving toward commercial application, the need for more viral vector continues to increase. Small batch sizes challenge manufacturers to create robust processes that can produce an equivalent product every time and when organizations advance in their clinical development, scale-up of these processes is an inherent challenge. \n\nAs with cell therapy production, the raw materials used for vector production are equally vital and must be sourced with rigorous quality checks to minimize the risk of introducing adventitious agents into the production process.",

Phage display was one of the early methods developed to generate recombinant antibodies (Carmen and Jermutus, 2002;Brichta et al., 2005). Using antibody-fragment encoding genes (VH and VL) and bacteriophage capsid gene fusion, this technology enables sets of human antibody libraries to be stored in prokaryotic systems where they can be readily expressed by phage infection. Prokaryotic expression systems promise large-scale antibody production in short time periods. In addition, this system generates antibody fragments lacking the Fc domain rather than intact IgG antibodies, eliminating nonspecific binding to the Fc receptor (Knappik and Brundiers, 2009). The recombinant antibodies are expressed and displayed in the phage capsid, and then purified using column chromatography. Recently, other methods have been developed to generate recombinant antibodies in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g., yeast display) or even in vitro environments (e.g., mRNA display, ribosome display), which provide additional advantages for recombinant antibody fabrication (Irving et al., 2001;Chao et al., 2006;Tabata et al., 2009). \n\nThe fabrication of functional protein microarrays faces an even bigger challenge because of the need for large amounts of highly purified proteins. Furthermore, to generate functional proteins, biochemical characteristics (such as protein folding and posttranslational modifications) and physical conditions during the purification procedure have to be considered. To overcome these hurdles, highthroughput protein purification protocols have been developed using both Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and E. coli protein expression systems. Using a batch purification protocol in a 96-well format, >4000 recombinant proteins can be overexpressed and purified in yeast or E. coli (Zhu et al., 2001;Chen et al., 2008;Jeong et al., 2012).",

The production hosts for these proteins are common mammalian cell lines such as SP2/0 and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, mainly cultured in fed batch mode bioreactors 1 .\n\nThe high demands for mAbs along with their low expression yields have led many producer companies to perform the expres-sion procedure in 10,000 L or larger volume bioreactors 2 . Additionally, the expression titers have sharply increased throughout the improvements in the production process and media development 2 . During the last three decades, extensive studies have endeavored to achieve high production titers through developing new media and appropriate supplementation strategies [3][4][5] . Although fully chem.ically defined media have developed and employed in large-scale mAb production, not all antibody production cell lines have high expression titters in these chemically defined media 6 . Therefore, many scientists attempt to increase productivity through enriching basal media with supplements. The familiar supplements for mammalian cell culture include variety of defined and undefined components such as human or bovine sera albumins, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, lipids, buffers and proteins like growth factors and protein hydrolysates 7 .\n\nSerum as a major supplement has been implemented for mammalian cell cultivations in feeding stages of developing biopharmaceuticals. It contains several growth-promoting compounds like growth factors, nutrients and hormones 8 . However, it has numerous disadvantages including a variation in shelf-life and composition from batch to batch. It also presents difficulties in the purification of the protein product and is often associated with high costs 9 .\n\nAnd last but not least, is the risk of viral, mycoplasma or prion contaminants which may induce a contagious risk to the biopharmaceutical product. Therefore, bovine serum and other animal derived raw materials should be preferably avoided if possible 8 . Nevertheless, substituting all important components of serum with chemically defined elements has shown to be challenging since the growth requirements may vary widely between cell lines and sometimes between clones 10 .\n\nMoreover, serum-free or even protein-free media",

Consequently, the production of both conventional and fragment antibodies constantly faces more demanding challenges for the improvement of their quantity and quality. The answer to such an increasing need has been the development of a wide array of formats and alternative production platforms. This review offers a critical comparison and evaluation of the different options to help the researchers interested in expressing recombinant antibodies in their choice.ResultsRather than the compilation of an exhaustive list of the recent publications in the field, this review intendeds to analyze the development of the most innovative or fast-growing strategies. These have been illustrated with some significant examples and, when possible, compared with the existing alternatives. Space has also been given to those solutions that might represent interesting opportunities or that investigate critical aspects of the production optimization but for which the available data as yet do not allow for a definitive judgment.ConclusionsThe take-home message is that there is a clear process of progressive diversification concerning the antibody expression platforms and an effort to yield directly application-adapted immune-reagents rather than generic naked antibodies that need further in vitro modification steps before becoming usable.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are complex exogenous (\"foreign\") proteins that are produced in expression hosts, and mainly used as medical diagnostic reagents and in human healthcare as vaccines, drugs, or monoclonal antibodies [1]. The prominent role and increasing market demand for high-value recombinant proteins in novel drug discovery creates an opportunity for the development of various protein expression hosts to manufacture proteins by following the existing rigid standards laid down for veterinary and human applications. The industry is focusing mainly on already established production platforms using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as Escherichia coli, a selection of yeast, insect, and mammalian cell cultures, due to their well-defined processes in-line with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) [2]. Moreover, industrially established mammalian and other cell cultures have stringent regulatory approval in place, which hinders the industrial acceptance of the new technology or production system. Bacterial expression systems offer rapid production with high product yield, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (yeast) offer post-translational modifications (PTMs) which are essential for functional activity of the recombinant proteins [3]. The majority of the approved recombinant biopharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cell lines [4]. However, all the production systems have their own merits and setbacks such as production time, high operating costs, protein yield, chances of contamination with pathogenic microorganisms, limited post-translational modifications, and regulatory approval. In order to compete with the established platform, the new expression system must have unique advantages that can overcome the limitations of the existing ones. Plants offer several potential benefits over conventional expression platforms and prove the reliability of the system for the production of highly valuable proteins. Advancements in plant molecular farming approaches in the recent decade have made plants an attractive manufacturing system that can even achieve commercially relevant production levels in a short period [1,5,6]. As the progress is continuously being made in this ever-growing field, here in this review, we summarize the importance and prospects of plant expression systems for the cost-effective production of recombinant proteins. Potential vaccine candidates, monoclonal antibodies, and industrial enzymes expressed in plants are also described.",

Cost-of-goods is directly related to manufacturing and product demand, necessitating modular plug-and-play manufacturing solutions that can respond quickly to market and product processing requirements. 6 Designing of next generation manufacturing facilities has therefore focused on incorporation of single-use, flexible and modular concepts into facility design that gives advantages of faster speed to market, capital investment deferment and better cost predictability. 6,13,14 key enabler is the move from fed-batch bioreactor production with independent, batch downstream unit operations toward singleuse integrated and continuous bioprocessing (ICB), utilizing continuous perfusion bioreactors with a linked and continuous downstream. 15,16 ICB has well documented advantages for clinical and in some cases commercial manufacturing. These include: reduced capital and operating costs 6,15,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] ; increased productivity and reduced facility size through process intensification 6,15,17,18,20 ; facilitation of multiproduct \"ballroom\" facilities 25,26 ; improved flexibility to respond to changing demand 6,18,26 ; increased process sustainability through a reduction in process mass intensity (PMI) 15,22,24 ; and improved product quality consistency. 10,27 common framework is emerging within the industry for companies implementing ICB. 15,16",

They are regarded as safe host by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are able to perform efficient post-translational modifications, can be cultured in serum-free suspension in large scale bioreactors and moderate specific productivity can be overcome by gene amplification [23]. In the last decades a lot of effort has been spent on improvements in media composition and in bioprocess modifications which resulted in CHO fed-batch bioprocesses for antibody production that typically have specific productivities in the range of 50 -60 pg/cell/day and volumetric titers of 1 -5 g/l [24]. These achievements are true for IgG class molecules but for more complex antibody structures like IgM none of these values have been reported. Kunert and colleagues performed a class-switch from IgG to IgM with the potent broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies 4E10 [25]. This IgM was recombinantly expressed in serum containing CHO DUKX-B11 cells resulting in cell clones with a maximum specific productivity of 10 pg/cell/day compared to the IgG1 cell line which produced 15 pg/cell/day. In another study serum containing CHO-K1 and NS0 cells were compared for the expression of IgMs with different oligomerization status. The CHO-K1 cell line was used to obtain hexameric IgMs and the NS0 cells which constitutively expressed mouse J-chain were used to produce pentameric IgMs [26]. Both cell lines exhibited similar volumetric titers of 5 -10 mg/l. In 2009, Tchoudakova reported about a panel of IgMs that were recombinantly expressed in PER.C6 cells with specific productivities of about 20 pg/cell/day in a batch process. However, in fed batch mode only volumetric titers of 0.9 -2.3 g/l could be realized [27].",

            "text": "Thus far, in this review, we described the bioactive compounds which plants naturally produce that can be used for industrial purposes. However, plants can also be considered as green biofactories for the production of recombinant products and recombinant proteins such as antibodies, vaccines, enzymes and growth factors. In recent years, biotechnological industries for the large-scale production of pharmaceuticals have mostly exploited Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cell cultures as production platforms. This choice was mainly due to the well-defined processes which were established by good manufacturing practices (GMPs) [106]. Since the 1980s, engineered plants have been subject of increasing interest as low-input production platforms for diagnostic reagents and pharmaceutical proteins. This \"green\" approach attracted attention among industries and the term plant molecular farming (PMF) was introduced into the scientific community [106][107][108]. Low expense, rapidity, scalability, flexibility, versatility, low or no-pathogen load, the robustness of the system and the possibility to manipulate the protein glycosylation pattern in plants are the major factors that led the PMF to success among several biotechnological strategies for molecule production (Figure 2) [106][107][108]. The recombinant products and proteins produced in plants are also free of both human pathogens and endotoxins, major concerns of producing recombinant proteins in mammalian cell culture and bacterial production systems [108]. Many pharmaceuticals have been produced in plants, some of which have also been tested in clinical trials [106,107]. Examples include the animal-derived peptides with therapeutic properties such as human insulin, human serum albumin and even HIV-neutralizing antibodies that have been produced from tobacco and corn seeds in the clinical trials financed by the projects Pharma-Planta and Future-Pharma [108]. Another example is a chimeric secretory IgA/G developed in transgenic tobacco plants that was marketed as a medical device (CaroRx) to prevent dental caries [107]. \n\nDifferent methods are now available and used for PMF.",

            "text": "In the present work, we present a method for improving antibody titer and manufacturability in the XpressCF+ \u00ae system. We have engineered a cell line with an oxidizing cytoplasm capable of LC expression at the 3-9-g/L scale. Prefabricated LC protein was then added as a protein reagent to CFPS reactions expressing the antibody HC, and a 50-100% increase in titer was observed relative to CFPS reactions co-expressing both the HC and LC antibody subunits. The primary mechanism for this titer increase is believed to be through the reallocation of the CFPS translation machinery to focus on HC production. This method was validated for five antibodies and demonstrated at scales from a 100-\u00b5L microplate to a 0.25-L stirred tank bioreactor. Antibodies produced in CFPS using PFLC were indistinguishable from those produced using HC/LC co-expression by both biophysical and functional assays. This approach combines the strength of in vivo E. coli expression (inexpensive manufacturing of recombinant proteins with high titer) with cell-free protein synthesis (an environment capable of incorporating multiple nnAAs in properly folded and assembled IgGs). The benefits of this system are numerous; the PFLC reagent increases titers, streamlines the CFPS workflow, and makes the CFPS reactions more robust when compared to the conventional HC/LC co-expression approach. Development of the hybrid PFLC cell-free platform described in this work improves the competitiveness of cell-free manufacturing for site-specific ADCs, allowing patients expanded access to these promising new molecules.",

            "text": "71].\n\nAs a result, the primary framework for generation for therapeutic recombinant proteins is utilising mammalian cell lines as for ectopically expressed mammalian genes, they are the nearest likeness to the native environment and in this way have an inherent capability to create functional mammalian proteins [8]. Therein, mammalian cells are the largest contributors to recombinant proteins on the market at about 70% [73]. They can perform the proper and necessary folding, post-translational modifications and glycosylation in patterns similar to those in humans which reduces the risk of rejection besides being able adapt to large-scale production systems and produce large volumes of therapeutic antibodies [74,75]. Glycosylation in antibodies is an important factor to note as it has incredible diversity and complexity of which antibody structure and function is crucially dependent on. Glycosylation patterns can determine structure and effector functions of antibodies including ADCC, CDC and its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics properties [4]. Despite that, recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines can encounter complications in expression yields, time required to produce over-expressing lines, along with increased cost [8].\n\nThe most popular cell line used in industrial therapeutic production is CHO cell lines. CHO cell lines can expand rapidly to large densities in bioreactors, generate high quantities of recombinant protein, increased resistance to human virus transmissions, and generate human compatible post-translational modifications, besides possessing a genome with considerable plasticity which increases its flexibility to being genetically modified and manufacturing process scales [7]. Despite these many advantages, their characteristics of being genomically unstable and heterogeneous results in regular genotypic variation and phenotypic instability, which brings about cell line instability and therefore, concerns about the process reproducibility and consistency [6]. This issue generates genomic instability over time, causing a drop in protein production and thus fabricates titer and product quality instability [7]. Expression of mAbs from mouse and hamster-derived cell lines has its downsides as nonhuman cell lines express proteins with glycan structures which differ substantially from humans, and they are N-glycolylneuraminic acid and galactose-alpha 1,3-galact",

Shorter development timelines may enable new drugs to reach patients sooner and allow biopharmaceutical companies to secure first-to-market status.\n\nFor some classes of molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, platform manufacturing processes have emerged to reduce the time and effort required to develop a manufacturing process for a new molecule. In a platform process, the overall unit operations and order of these operations are standardized. Each new product, therefore, requires only minimal optimization of these steps. Biopharmaceutical pipelines are becoming more diverse, however, and other classes of biologics generally require unique production and purification processes, even for similar molecules (Morrison, 2020). Developing processes for these nonplatform biologics requires significant time and effort, limiting the number of molecules that can be manufactured for nonclinical or clinical use.\n\nWe have previously shown that a holistic approach to process development, coupled with a bench-scale, integrated manufacturing platform, can reduce the time required to produce nonclinical material for a new biologic product to as few as 12 weeks after obtaining a target product sequence . Further improvements to the process development timeline could be possible through the development of predictive or platform approaches to the manufacture of different classes of molecules, particularly in the chromatographic purification.\n\nSingle-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are a class of molecules for which a platform approach could be developed. sdAbs offer the affinity and therapeutic value of conventional antibodies with increased stability and solubility (Arbabi-Ghahroudi, 2017). Their small size (12-15 kDa) allows them to bind to previously intractable targets and their increased stability presents the potential for oral dosage (for intestinal diseases) (Harmsen & Haard, 2007). Significant scientific research has been conducted on sdAbs since their discovery in the early 1990s (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993), and recent events have highlighted the therapeutic potential of this class of molecules.

With more and more rAAV\u2010based therapies entering late\u2010stage clinical trials and commercialization, there is an increasing pressure on the rAAV manufacturing process to accelerate drug development, account for larger trials, and commercially provide high doses. Still, many of the pre\u2010clinical and clinical manufacturing processes are tied to outdated technologies, which results in substantial production expenses. Those processes face challenges including low productivity and difficult scalability, which limits its ability to provide for required dosages which in turn influences the accessibility of the drug. And as upstream efforts are expected to increase productivities, the downstream part needs to adapt with more scalable and efficient technologies. In this review, both traditional and novel rAAV downstream technologies are presented and discussed. Traditional rAAV downstream processes are based on density gradient ultracentrifugation and have been shown to effectively purify rAAVs with high yields and purities. However, those processes lack scalability and efficiency, which is why novel rAAV downstream processes based on column\u2010chromatography have emerged as an attractive alternative and show potential for integration in continuous processes, following the principle of next\u2010generation manufacturing.",

            "text": "At present, nanovaccines using nanoparticles (NPs) as vaccine vectors are becoming increasingly valuable tools to combat a plethora of diseases, such as cancer [1,2], hypertension [3], nicotine addiction [4], Alzheimer's disease [5], bacterial [6][7][8] and viral infections such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [9,10]. Polymeric NPs composed of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have long shown promising potential for various biomedical applications, including the production of nanovaccines [2,7,8,11]. However, the clinical translation of PLGA-based nanoformulations can be an expensive and challenging process. Translational failures in method integration and technology transfer from lab-to large-scale manufacturing while complying with good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations are considered among the main challenges [12]. Additionally, the physicochemical and structural properties of nanoformulations should be maintained during scale-up manufacturing as they directly determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles [10][11][12][13]. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize a robust and scalable manufacturing technique from the earliest stages of development to ensure that the same high level of quality and reproducibility are achieved at large-scale production. To this end, continuous processes are considered the most favorable for nanomedicine production at a large scale because they offer the advantage of preferably terminating production at the desired scale without changing the process or formulation parameters [12,14]. \n\nWe recently demonstrated the scale-up of an inline ultrasound-based process for the industrial production of PLGA-based nanoformulations that could reach a throughput of 84 g/h [15].",

            "text": "Recombinant biotherapeutic molecules, such as singledomain antibody fragments (dAbs), antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are produced in Escherichia coli due to its well-known physiology and genetics. Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully commercialized for a wide range of indications including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and pathogenic infections. mAb-based products continue to dominate the biopharmaceutical market, with total annual sales of $217 billion in 2022, which is an increase of nearly 80% over just 4 years (Walsh & Walsh, 2022). However, the cost of many mAbs is still prohibitive (>$50,000 per patient per year), significantly limiting the accessibility of these life-saving therapeutics (Hernandez et al., 2018). \n\nRecently, several regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, have encouraged the adoption of continuous bioprocessing as a way to reduce costs and improve manufacturing flexibility and product quality (Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015;Pollock et al., 2017;Zydney, 2016). The use of perfusion bioreactors for continuous production of biological products is well-established; Hernandez (2015) noted that approximately 19 marketed recombinant proteins/mAbs were produced using perfusion systems at the time of that assessment. However, the industry continues to rely predominantly on fed-batch processes (Bielser et al., 2018), and the integration with continuous downstream processing has been more challenging. \n\nThe large increase in mAb titers that has been achieved in upstream processes over the past decade (Shukla et al., 2017) has generated renewed interest in using targeted precipitation as a lowcost alternative for mAb purification (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014;Pons Royo et al., 2023). Several recent studies have demonstrated the robustness and stability of mAb precipitation from clarified cell culture fluids (CCF) in a tubular flow precipitation reactor (Burgstaller et al., 2019;Dutra et al., 2020;Hammerschmidt et al., 2014Hammerschmidt et al., , 2016;;Li et al., 2019;Pons Royo et al., 2023). Pons Royo et al. (2023) reported a 53% reduction in costs for mAb precipitation compared to initial capture using Protein A periodic countercurrent chromatography.",

Many other therapeutic proteins reportedly produced by the transient expression platform include IgG and IgA antibodies [209,210], vaccine antigens against malaria, influenza and HIV [211][212][213][214][215], and therapeutic enzymes treating lysosomal storage diseases [216]; see recent reviews [140,195,217,218]. \n\nTransient expression is easily applied to industrial scale for mass production of recombinant proteins. Milligram to gram quantities of target proteins can be rapidly produced in weeks to allow animal and clinical testing. Several plant biotech companies, including Kentucky BioProcessing LLC (Owensboro, KY), Medicago Inc. (Quebec, Canada), Fraunhofer CMB (Newark, DE), Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. (San Diego, CA), and iBio Biotherapeutics (Bryan, TX), have developed cGMP manufacturing facilities for biopharmaceuticals using vacuum agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana [219]. A major disadvantage of the transient system is the necessity of harvesting at a particular time. If using the product in humans or animals, an additional purification step to remove endotoxins derived from the infiltrated Agrobacterium is required [85]. Transient expression systems have been continuously optimized in the past decade for rapid, high-yield, and large-scale production of recombinant proteins, which expedites the acceptance of this production platform for the commercial production of a broad range of biopharmaceuticals.",

            "text": "The comprehensive analysis of mAb manufacturing reveals significant advances in process optimization, cost reduction strategies, and emerging technologies while highlighting critical areas for future development and research. \n\nKey findings demonstrate a clear evolution in manufacturing approaches, with continuous processing showing substantial cost advantages of up to 35% for specific production scales. 8 The integration of single-use technologies and hybrid systems has enabled greater flexibility and reduced capital investment requirements, with hybrid facilities achieving breakeven points 2-2.5 years earlier than traditional stainless steel facilities. 43 Additionally, advances in media optimization and process integration have led to significant improvements in production efficiency and cost reduction. \n\nThe implications for the biopharmaceutical industry are substantial. Manufacturers must carefully evaluate their production strategies based on scale-dependent considerations, with different approaches optimal at varying production volumes. The emergence of machine learning applications and advanced analytics has created new opportunities for process optimization and real-time control, though implementation requires significant investment in infrastructure and expertise. According to recent studies, 39 the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in bioprocess development has demonstrated remarkable potential in improving process understanding and control. \n\nFuture research directions should focus on several key areas: \n\nThe field of mAb manufacturing continues to evolve rapidly, driven by technological advances and increasing demand for biological therapeutics. Success in this evolving landscape will require continued innovation in process design, optimization strategies, and implementation approaches. As highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan, 27,44 the integration of deep learning and other advanced technologies offers promising pathways for future developments in protein expression optimization and process control. \n\nThe future of mAb manufacturing lies in the successful integration of these elements, creating more efficient, flexible, and reliable production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. Continued R&D in these areas will be crucial for meeting the growing global demand for mAb therapeutics while ensuring their economic viability and accessibility.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are the foremost source of human mortalities around the globe. The recent COVID-19 pandemic vividly illustrates the lack of global preparedness for novel viral diseases (Lobato Gomez et al., 2021). In addition to the emergence of newly emerging diseases, many well-known infectious viruses, for instance, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza, continuously undergo genetic changes, thus giving rise to frequent outbreaks associated with severe illnesses and fatalities. The rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an unprecedented global crisis, resulting in millions of deaths (Hu et al., 2021). Therefore, cost effective and rapid biomanufacturing of recombinant vaccine antigens at large scale for remedy against numerous infectious diseases will be urgently needed. Molecular farming, also known as biopharming, is a cutting-edge technology that harnesses the ability of plant's cells, organs, or tissues as bio-factories for the production of valuable biopharmaceuticals and other high-value proteins, including vaccine antigens (Faye and Gomord, 2010;Ma et al., 2003). This technology offers a promising alternative to traditional methods of protein production using prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Escherichia coli (E. coli), human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, Pichia pastoris (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000;Macauley-Patrick et al., 2005), and insect systems such as Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9). These production hosts are widely accepted for large scale manufacturing because of the welldefined regulatory pathway available (Schillberg et al., 2005) higher expression and ease of production; however, each production platform comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Plants are the bio-factories of diverse and complex proteins and offer several advantages. Plants allow for scalable and cost-effective production due to their ability to be cultivated on masses.",

After successful process performance qualification (PPQ) of the batches at the two scales at Regeneron, the process was rapidly transferred to an even larger stainless-steel manufacturing scale (25 000 L) at Genentech's Vacaville manufacturing facility as part of the Genentech collaboration. The process transfer for these antibodies was the first between the two companies. This transfer required building process transfer teams and understanding different manufacturing systems while working virtually as pandemic travel restrictions prevented inperson support. Use of key raw materials, during a period of supply chain disruptions, from Regeneron inventories for the initial batches at Genentech was a further demonstration of the collaborative effort. Collaborations and process transfers between biopharmaceutical companies do not routinely occur at this level of speed and need.\n\nGenentech continued the focus on accelerated timelines by executing multiple steps of the typical transfer process in parallel ( Figure 2). Site functional teams instilled the Regeneron platform process requirements by developing aligned process descriptions, batch records, and facility modifications concurrent with the project strategy deliverables such as transfer gap and risk analysis and master transfer plans.\n\nMultiple entry points existed for optimizing the speed and need during development and transfer, and this paper describes a subset of the process development aspects for the first time. Downstream examples illustrate the speed obtained through minimizing the development timelines at Regeneron and performing atscale resin carryover studies at Genentech in parallel with the manufacturing operations. Upstream examples address the need through successful production scale-up that focuses on appropriate production bioreactor gassing strategies at both companies.",

            "text": "Moreover, this process configuration may also present process throughout and facility fit challenges, particularly for manufacturing facilities optimized around three column mAb platform process. To address this challenge, a logical approach is to \"piggyback\" aggregate clearance steps on other requisite unit operations of a conventional mAb platform process (e.g., Protein A capture or low pH virus inactivation). This approach would enable orthogonal aggregate removal steps to be introduced into the purification train improving process robustness, and potentially allow the scFv-IgG purification process to adopt a more mAb platform-like three-column process with higher process yields and fewer facility fit constraints. \n\nIn this work, the authors examine strategies for removal of high aggregate levels from recombinant scFv-IgG feed streams. In particular, the authors consider approaches with potential to integrate into a conventional mAb platform purification process in a minimally disruptive manner. Three nonconventional aggregate removal steps are investigated in detail, Protein A capture with pH gradient elution, calcium phosphate precipitation, and high performance tangential flow filtration (HPTFF). The optimized aggregate removal steps are then integrated with a conventional mAb platform purification process and demonstrated at bench scale. One of the bench scale processes incorporating Protein A capture with pH gradient elution and calcium phosphate precipitation is then piloted to demonstrate scalability.",

            "text": "Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have gained significant attention in the biopharmaceutical field due to their capability to target two different targets or two epitopes on one antigen, potentially enabling the design of novel therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoA) and enhancing efficacy [1]. BsAbs achieve their specific functions due to their unique molecular structure. However, this necessitates meticulous design and development to guarantee both their efficacy and manufacturability [2,3]. \n\nManufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, [4] which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible [5,6]. Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial [7,8]. \n\nAs one of the most common manufacturability issues, antibody aggregation is highly undesirable. It may complicate the production process, impair biological activity, and increase the risk of immunogenicity [9][10][11][12]. Antibody aggregation could be mitigated through diverse approaches, including the development of purification process [13,14], and formulation optimization [15][16][17]. However, significant antibody aggregation that leads to product precipitation during downstream production will likely require sequence engineering [10,18,19]. The effectiveness of sequence engineering heavily relies on the fundamental understanding of aggregation mechanism at molecular level, mainly involving colloidal stability and conformational stability [20,21].",

However, ACTs also represent a distinct manufacturing challenge because the independent manufacture and subsequent mixing of monoclonal antibodies quickly becomes cost prohibitive as more complex mixtures are envisioned. We have developed a virus-free recombinant protein expression platform based on adeno-associated viral (AAV) elements that is capable of rapid and consistent production of complex antibody mixtures in a single batch format. Using both multiplexed immunoassays and cation exchange (CIEX) chromatography, cell culture supernatants generated using our system were assessed for stability of expression and ratios of the component antibodies over time. Cultures expressing combinations of three to ten antibodies maintained consistent expression levels and stable ratios of component antibodies for at least 60 days. Cultures showed remarkable reproducibility following cell banking, and AAV-based cultures showed higher stability and productivity than non-AAV based cultures. Therefore, this non-viral AAV-based expression platform represents a predictable, reproducible, quick and cost effective method to manufacture or quickly produce for preclinical testing recombinant antibody combination therapies and other recombinant protein mixtures.",

These challenges are inherent to the current manufacturing process of mAbs as the production of mAbs is performed in mammalian cell lines followed by purification from complex media, implying that an extensive purification process is needed to obtain a safe formulatable antibody from the cell culture supernatant free from viruses and other contaminants. In addition, monoclonal antibodies are prone to a wide variety of post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, deamidation, oxidation, incomplete disulfide bond formation, N-terminal glutamine cyclization, and C-terminal lysine processing. As these modifications can strongly impact the biological activity and therapeutic properties of the mAbs, they need to be characterized and controlled, necessitating the costly development and implementation of numerous analytical tools to assess these Quality Attributes. All these aspects lead to a challenging production process. At the same time, regulatory agencies ask for enhanced quality while health care systems demand lower process costs.",

            "text": "The commercialization of taliglucerase alfa (Protalix, Israel), the first FDA approved plant-produced product for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using stable plant suspension cells, solidified the potential of plant molecular pharming. However, as compared to stable transgenic production of recombinant proteins in plants, a transient production system offers a faster and higher level of production (Yamamoto et al. 2018). Various industrially important proteins have already been successfully produced via transient expression in plants such as \u03b1-amylase (Prado et al. 2019), Interleukin-6 (Nausch et al. 2012), antibodies (V\u00e9zina et al. 2009), HIV-1 Nef (Lombardi et al. 2009), eVLPs (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff 2008), and even COVID-19 proteins (Lindsay et al. 2020). Despite its benefits, the plant expression platform has yet to overcome its major challenges in terms of mass production and profitability (Habibi et al. 2017). \n\nIn theory, an ideal production system would have high-levels of recombinant protein accumulation and be created in an expression platform that is easy and inexpensive to cultivate. In soybeans, at 2.3% of total soluble protein (TSP) (Ding et al. 2006) and rice seeds at 9.6% of TSP (An et al. 2013), substantial levels of plant-made bFGF were already attained. However, due to the limited amount of seed biomass produced per unit of land and long growth cycles, this form of production would not be very efficient (Wang et al. 2015). Recombinant production in tobacco leaves, on the other hand, yields more biomass per unit of land. However, the yield of recombinant bFGF previously reported was only about 0.1% of TSP (Wang et al. 2015). Recently, bFGF was transiently produced in N. benthamiana leaves although at a rate of just 2.7 \u00b5g g \u22121 Fresh Weight (FW) (Rattanapisit et al. 2020). This degree of production should be pushed much farther in order for plant-produced bFGF to be more viable for industrial manufacturing.",

            "text": "The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell is an industry-leading cell line for the production of therapeutic proteins [1,2]. This is largely due to its advantageous manufacturing characteristics and the wealth of experience that the industry has accumulated over the past several decades. The manufacturing process starts with the development of a single cell clone with favorable manufacturing phenotypes, most notably the ability to secrete large quantities of a therapeutic protein. Historically, obtaining a high-expressing, stable clone would require numerous rounds of screening, which could take upwards of 9-12 months [1]. As molecular biology techniques have improved, several approaches, including plasmid optimization, the use of ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOEs), incorporation of transposase technologies, and the use of site-specific integration have been used to reduce development timelines, increase productivity, and enhance the probability of obtaining a high-expressing, stable clone [3][4][5][6]. Despite these advances, further improvements must be made to increase production levels and reduce the cost of developing and screening suitable cell lines for drug manufacturing [7]. Several studies indicate that the supplementation of small molecules into cell culture media can increase recombinant protein production, including a 3\u00d7 increase in monoclonal antibody production, and a nearly 100\u00d7 increase in the production of fluorescent and luminescent proteins [3,8,9]. Despite these benefits, small molecules are rarely incorporated into industrial-scale processes for several reasons. Doing so may require additional time and equipment to remove the small molecule during manufacturing processes and require the development of an assay to demonstrate sufficient clearance from the final drug substance. Additionally, significant testing would be required to ensure that expensive purification resins remain unchanged and available for cleaning and reuse in future production batches. Finally, the stability, availability, and quality of the new raw material would need to be carefully assessed, leading to substantial time and costs in the production of a therapeutic protein. Although these factors present significant hurdles for the incorporation of small molecules into manufacturing processes, valuable information can still be gained about the underlying biology of CHO cells through treatment with small molecules.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other derived therapeutic proteins are currently one of the most important product classes in the pharmaceutical industry and will likely remain relevant for many years to come [1,2]. Typical process formats comprise mammalian expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultivated in fed-batch processes with final production scales of several cubic meters [3]. Increasing market demands for monoclonal antibody therapeutics and the pressure for cost-reduction in their production [4,5] have led to new manufacturing approaches and improved facility utilization strategies e.g., continuous production [6,7]. For implementation of upcoming process intensification technologies, pharmaceutical companies can aim for scale out by building additional manufacturing capacities or for intensification in existing pharmaceutical production plants. Both strategies require substantial investments and the changes have to be balanced against cost and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment. In the case of fully continuous production processes, an implementation in existing fed-batch facilities is often impossible due to open technical and regulatory questions such as higher complexity and increased media amounts [7][8][9]. A smart step for the development and maintenance of marketable antibody portfolios is to search for intensification strategies, which debottleneck production chains using available capacities whenever possible and which are implementable in existing facilities, such as N \u2212 1 perfusion [10]. \n\nThe concept of pre-stage (N \u2212 1) perfusion shifts biomass production away from capital-intensive large-scale reactors into the smaller pre-stage systems, as described by Kloth et al. [10]. Cell retention combined with media exchange facilitates robust exponential cell proliferation without any loss of biomass and can be achieved by a number of technologies, which differ in robustness and scalability [11]. Perfusion processes have the potential to reach over 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL [12], so that the required biomass generation of several sequential batch pre-stages can be combined into one perfusion stage. Consequently, the number and size of seed bioreactors could be reduced shortening overall process timelines.",

            "text": "Continuous bioreactor operations aim to improve manufacturing by increasing process efficiency and plant utilization, and to implement automated process control, while maintaining flexibility and product quality [117,126]. Conversely to batch mode processes, the concept of continuous manufacturing describes an ongoing flow of material in and out of the bioreactor, altogether aiming at a constant harvest of virus without restarting the system. This strategy requires less manual operation during the process and avoids down-times for vessel cleaning, maintenance, calibration of sensors and sterilization (last-mentioned in cases of STRs). In addition, continuous processes are expected to keep by-product concentrations (e.g., proteases) at negligible concentrations, and to handle labile products rapidly [127], as most viruses lose their infectivity at higher temperatures and proteins forfeit their functionality.\n\nSince several years, regulatory agencies such as the US FDA encourage the establishment of cell-based continuous manufacturing processes, which has been the subject of serious attempts for recombinant protein production in CHO cells [117,[126][127][128]. Whether similar concepts can be transferred to cell-based virus manufacturing remains to be clarified as mutation rates of cells and viruses restricted their temporal use to currently 20 and 5 passages, respectively (including master seed). Further, and most importantly, is the uncertainty of possible virus vaccine generation in continuous processes from a biological point of view and the possibility to reach a steady state in any infected culture. The effect on virus antigenicity or virulence due to mutation accumulation during extended periods of viral replication remains as concern (reviewed in [129]). Technical challenges in process design and operation also lead to difficulties in scalability, process robustness and process validation. In addition, regulatory acceptance is not clear, as authorization requirements have not been defined so far.\n\nOvercoming technical challenges, laboratory-scale investigations with a continuous process for influenza A virus production using a two-stage stirred-tank bioreactor system were undertaken [130]. AGE1.CR cells grew constantly in a first bioreactor and were fed into a second bioreactor for influenza A virus infection and propagation. The harvest was removed continuously over a time period of 17 days. However, in the virus production bioreactor, neither the cell concentration nor the virus titers reached a steady state",

However, further application of Rituxan faces challenges of high production cost, which limits its availability in developing countries. Here, we report a new approach for large production of a recombinant anti-CD20 mAb in the milk of transgenic cattle (at a yield of up to ~6.8\u2009mg/mL), with ~80% recovery rate and >99% purity. Crystallography study showed that our recombinant mAb is structurally nearly identical to Rituxan with only minor differences in N-linked glycosylation pattern. Functional study showed that, while our mAb shared similar target-cell binding capacities and complement-dependent cytotoxicity with Rituxan, our product exhibited a higher binding affinity for Fc\u03b3RIII\u03b1 and a greater antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Accordingly, our recombinant mAb demonstrated a superior efficacy over Rituxan against B-cell lymphomas in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Taken together, our data supports transgenic cattle as a novel model for cost-competitive, large-scale production of therapeutic antibodies.",

            "text": ", pers. comm.). It is thus evident that recombinant pharmaceuticals manufacturing in plants are feasible. The focus now shifts back to target products and applications where plant manufacture is most desirable. Although lower cost of goods is a desirable feature of Nicotiana-based manufacturing, the potential for low cost of entry to clinical trials (a result of reduced early capital costs) may be an additional and significant driver. Of equal importance is the potential scalability of manufacture, which opens up prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions that were previously unattainable.\n\nHIV-neutralizing antibodies are therefore an obvious target for manufacture in plants. They would almost certainly be required at a very large scale, and cost of goods may become an important consideration for cocktail products containing two, three or more active drug products. Very recently, two groups reported production of VRC01 mAb in plant transient expression systems (Hamorsky et al., 2013;Rosenberg et al., 2013). Hamorsky et al. (2013) devised a novel tobamovirus replicon vector in N. benthamiana, while Rosenberg et al. (2013) reported transient expression using the same pTRAk vector used here in both N. benthamiana and N. tabacum. Both groups demonstrated successful expression of functional VRC01 of levels equivalent to those achieved here. In this study, we have demonstrated VRC01 production by stable expression in transgenic plants.\n\nThe finding that the expression levels in stable transgenics and transient expression were quite similar was unexpected, as previous literature has generally indicated much higher levels of expression using transient systems (Marillonnet et al., 2005;Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008). Interestingly, with a second transient expression system CPMV-HT (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008), similar levels of expression were also obtained (data not shown). In the case of HIV bNAbs, the use of a highly efficient transgenic system may be extremely advantageous, because the simplified manufacturing process could be performed in resource-poor regions, especially those that have an urgent interest in addressing HIV transmission.\n\nThe transgenic plant lines generated here expressed VRC01 with no additional sequences (such as the KDEL tags used by Rosenberg et al.) or residual amino acids (",

However, high variability in transient recombinant protein accumulation has also been shown between different N. tabacum cultivars, with some tabacum cultivars performing even better than N. benthamiana (Conley et al., 2011). Prior to purification, we measured antibody levels of~460 mg/ kg in N. benthamiana leaves. Comparable antibody yields in nonreplicating transient systems have been achieved by others, and can be as high as 325 mg/kg FW (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008), 400 mg/kg (Saxena et al., 2011), 460 mg/kg (Garabagi et al., 2012) or in some cases 1.5 g/kg with average of 757 mg/kg FW (V ezina et al., 2009). The latter yield was achieved using syringe infiltration and with the assistance of another transgene silencing suppressor protein from Potato virus Y (HcPro) (Brigneti et al., 1998), but at larger scales using vacuum infiltration the average yield of the same IgG was 328 mg/kg FW. Even higher yields have been achieved with replicating plant viral vectors in which the viral RNA polymerases (RdRPs) produce large numbers of transcripts in each cell (Bendandi et al., 2010;Giritch et al., 2006;Huang et al., 2010).\n\nSeveral recently published articles have addressed the technoeconomic principles of biomanufacturing facilities based on transient expression in N. benthamiana (Buyel and Fischer, 2012;Nandi et al., 2016;Tuse et al., 2014;Walwyn et al., 2015). Although the projected cost of goods sold (COGS) varies due to the effects of expression level, purification strategy and production capacity, there is generally a significant cost reduction compared to mammalian systems, and generally, the models agree very well when adjusted for production level, expression level and downstream recovery. The most recent model for a transient Nicotiana-based platform for the production of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody arrives",

            "text": "Recombinant antibody production technology has been cultivated and implemented in the biopharmaceutical industry, as it elicits high consistency and reproducibility. Appleby et al. created a humanized monoclonal antibody against human MMP9 (hMMP9) and described its enzymatical activity by investigating the three-dimensional structure (PDB: 5th9) [10]. Even though the sequence of this antibody was disclosed as well as the recombinant antibody was opportunely generated, the yield was not adequate for a large-scale expression. Hence, additional development of the production performance was imperative. \n\nMammalian cell expression systems are the preference to produce eukaryotic proteins, as they facilitate post-translation modifications, which are critical for the correct folding of proteins. Glycoproteins including antibodies are usually synthesized in mammalian cells, whereas microbial hosts, such as E. coli, are without the requisite machinery to synthesize proper glycosylated forms [13,14]. Either transient transfection or development of a stable cell line is the approach to produce antibodies in mammalian cells, and those production outputs are typically much higher than those by E. coli-based production. It is possible to generate secreted mammalian proteins in a large-scale format in mammalian cells, such as human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Transient cell lines, such as HEK cells, have been utilized because of their high transfection effectiveness and antibody production capacity. It has been demonstrated, however, that there are variances in the manufacturability, affinity, and efficacy of antibodies developed in HEK cells compared with those created by stably transfected CHO cells [15]. A stable CHO cell line is extensively used in adept antibody production because it performs human-compatible post-translational modifications and does not spread human pathogenic viruses [16]. Thus, CHO cell expression has become predominant for fabricating owing to its capability to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibody or antibody fragments with a constant quality [17,18].",

            "text": "The industrialized production of vaccines requires consistent and validated processes and control assays of each step to ensure that the final product matches the quality standards for human use. The main production steps and the relative quality control tests are summarized in Figure 6. One of the most important steps in an industrialized production process is represented by purification. In the case of plant-based systems, the whole plant or plant tissues/organs are harvested and processed in purification facilities under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). In the upstream processing a clarified extract is generated and moved to downstream processing and eventually formulated to produce the material according to quality standards. The recovery of recombinant proteins from host cells/tissues can be carried out by physical or chemical cell lysis. Centrifugation, depth filtration, microfiltration, or tangential flow filtration (TFF) are used for clarifying the cell lysate. Microfiltration is preferred in large production due to the robustness and scalability. An endonuclease treatment with Benzonase may be employed to degrade residual nucleic acids. The ultrafiltration/diafiltration/ultracentrifugation step may be included in the process to concentrate and buffer exchange the product, removing endonuclease, and also makes it ready for the next steps [128,129]. During concentration and buffer exchange the host cell proteins are further reduced. Purification by anion exchange chromatography is additionally used to decrease the amount of DNA and proteins from the host or eventual plant toxins. As an example, the affinity column purification process for recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed from tobacco leaves can remove alkaloids [130]. Altogether, the entire purification procedures represent the bottleneck for vaccine production as being the most time consuming, laborious, and expensive step. Moreover, each vaccine candidate demands specific procedures. \n\nPlant-based systems are often described as cost-effective due to the low cost of upstream cultivation. Different groups tried to estimate manufacturing costs for plant-based processes for monoclonal antibodies or other biopharmaceuticals, and concluded that cultivation accounts for only a small part of the process costs, while the downstream processing, especially purification, represents the major weakness that limits the commercial utilization of plant-based biopharmaceuticals [30,131,132].",

            "text": "After successful cell line development and clone selection, small-scale cultures using microtiter plates, test tubes, tissue culture flasks, and shake flasks are generally used for screening of recombinant protein expression. Various cultivation parameters, such as media composition, pH, agitation, aeration, temperature, cell density, the concentration of inducers, induction time, and feeding strategies affect the protein expression level depending upon expression systems (Gronemeyer et al., 2014;Tripathi, 2016). Thus, it is essential to evaluate each of the cultivation conditions for the expression of every recombinant protein and the development of effective bioprocesses. Recently, high-throughput process development (HTPD) techniques have become available and have been effectively utilized for process optimization in a cost-effective manner (Baumann and Hubbuch, 2017). Single-use upstream and downstream processing techniques have also been used for recombinant proteins to minimize the production cost and process time (Langer and Rader, 2014). After successful process development, large-scale production is carried out using bioreactor systems to fulfill the demand for biopharmaceuticals. Batch, fedbatch, and continuous or perfusion culture are used for bulk production of recombinant proteins. Continuous bioprocessing has also emerged as a novel technique and has been used in both upstream and downstream process development as well as in manufacturing for therapeutic proteins (Subramanian, 2018). The implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) and process analytical technologies (PAT) tools has improved biopharmaceutical production strategies (Kornecki and Strube, 2018;Shekhawat et al., 2019). The framework of bioprocess modeling and control also offers robust control solutions and is advantageous for optimal bioprocess design (Baumann and Hubbuch, 2017). Integrated continuous bioprocessing has also been developed recently; this allows smaller facilities and equipment footprints and facilitates rapid process development and process scale up (Godawat et al., 2015;Zydney, 2015). New developments in manufacturing processes are bringing benefits in terms of cost of production, manufacturing flexibility, and quality of the end product.",

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.",

Applying a previously developed methodology for the improvement of Gag-GFP VLPs [19,41], we obtained a 5.5-fold increase in the VLPs yield ( Figure 6). These results are of paramount importance considering that one of the main goals in the development of a vaccine candidate is the reduction for producing a vaccine dose. This becomes even more important when the vaccine is for veterinary applications, where prices are low and the achievements in the optimization of the process would have a higher impact. Furthermore, this TGE technique can be applied not only in batch and fed-batch processes, but to continuous VLPs production in bioreactor with perfusion, offering a platform for the future process development and scale up of this vaccine candidate production [56,57]. In any event, it is important to be aware that TGE present several challenges for its scaling-up process, including the large-scale high-quality DNA production and the need to prepare the DNA/polyplexes before their addition into the bioreactor, where large volume manipulation can cause delays in complex formation, impacting on the complex size distribution and, consequently, on the transfection efficiency. In addition, some TGE procedures include a medium exchange step, whereby scaling-up this is labor-intensive and associated with potential contamination risk. Nevertheless, in the last few years, great advances have been achieved in this field [20], which allow us to propose this culture platform for the production of a novel FMDV vaccine candidate.\n\nIn conclusion, we consider that the results presented in this work represent a valid approach to the development of a novel recombinant FMDV vaccine candidate, avoiding virus manipulation during production, with no requirement for viral contention facilities. Furthermore, the results also show the capacity of Gag-VLPs as a platform to incorporate antigens from unrelated diseases. This enables the use of the already developed and optimized bioprocess for the Gag-VLP production to give a rapid response to emerging diseases or pandemic outbreaks only co-transfecting with the desired epitope.

            "text": "Immunoglobulin A mediates immune protection at mucosal surfaces, the major portal of entry for many pathogens, and therefore holds great potential as a therapeutic and prophylatic agent. One of the challenges in producing therapeutic IgAs is to ensure that this complex recombinant protein has the desired functional properties. Advances in molecular biology techniques have allowed for rapid cloning, expression, and characterization of antibodies, resulting in a greater understanding of protein assembly and secretion pathways, ligand-receptor interactions, the role of carbohydrates in glycoprotein function, and antibody effector functions. The challenge is to now use the resulting information to produce effective IgA-based therapeutic molecules. \n\nPosttranslational modifications are important for correct antibody function. An important posttranslational modification is glycosylation, and consistent and correct glycosylation is especially important for producing functional IgA and SIgA in which the H-chain, J-chain, and SC all have significant amounts of surface-exposed carbohydrates. Murine myelomas and CHO cells have been the expression system of choice for the production of antibodies. However, these expression systems do not add carbohydrates identical to those found on human IgA. The use of human cell lines for expression might help to resolve this problem. Transgenic animals are an attractive expression system, especially for the production of SIgA in milk (Houdebine, 2000). However, the choice of species becomes important because there are species-specific differences in glycan addition. However, these differences might be less of an issue when the recombinant protein will be used for topical administration. \n\nThe recombinant antibody industry is in its infancy and shows great promise for rapid and extensive growth. It is expected that IgA will take its place alongside IgG as an important therapeutic molecule. However, for this to take place, certain issues and problems must be addressed. These include the issue of the cost of these complex biologics that require the use of expensive media along with the high costs associated with the purification process. The availability and cost of bovine serum in many growth media are issues that can be addressed by the use of serum-free growth media.",

            "text": "The manufacturing of bispecific antibodies can be challenging for a variety of reasons. For example, protein expression problems, stability issues, or the use of non-standard approaches for manufacturing can result in poor yield or poor facility fit. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of standard antibody platforms for large-scale manufacturing of bispecific IgG1 by controlled Fab-arm exchange. Two parental antibodies that each contain a single matched point mutation in the CH3 region were separately expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and manufactured at 1000 L scale using a platform fed-batch and purification process that was designed for standard antibody production. The bispecific antibody was generated by mixing the two parental molecules under controlled reducing conditions, resulting in efficient Fab-arm exchange of >95% at kg scale. The reductant was removed via diafiltration, resulting in spontaneous reoxidation of interchain disulfide bonds. Aside from the bispecific nature of the molecule, extensive characterization demonstrated that the IgG1 structural integrity was maintained, including function and stability. These results demonstrate the suitability of this bispecific IgG1 format for commercial-scale manufacturing using standard antibody manufacturing techniques.",

            "text": "Growing cells in continuous cultures results in a steady-state operation, which is easier to characterize and understand, but it can also have economic benefits. Many growing industries have at one point made a switch from batch to continuous manufacturing and this has had a tremendous effect on their efficiencies [9]. Several examples of continuous bioprocesses can be found, including wastewater treatment, composting, biogas, ethanol, and single cell protein production [78,79]. Maintaining cells in a producing state for extended time periods is a major advantage that can lead to high volumetric productivities in continuous bioprocesses. In case of processes with microorganisms, the space-time-yields can be especially high due to their ability to grow very fast. Several other benefits, such as lower setup and running costs, reduced equipment size, product quality and process scalability, have been associated with continuous bioprocesses [8,9]. Continuous manufacturing in smaller production vessels could also decrease the problems associated with process scale-up as pilotand production-scale processes can be carried out using more similar equipment. Even though high efficiencies of continuous recombinant protein processes with different microorganisms can be found in the scientific literature [39,63,80], their commercialization is limited. As adaptation is driven by economics, the risks associated with continuous processes must be considered. Several issues possibly affecting continuous manufacturing have been raised: challenges with long-term stability and sterility, poor short-term flexibility due to long run times and genetic instability of cells to name a few [81]. Some attempts have been made to create lower mutation rate hosts [82], but it is difficult to eliminate this risk completely. Novel selection marker strategies [57], tunable expression [7], and bioprocess strategies [69] have been used to mitigate the stability issues. Even if most of the hurdles can be overcome, the choice between batch and continuous process finally depends on the longer-term objectives of the facilities as large rearrangements or totally new systems are required.",

This property has been optimized to the extent that current industrial production strains are capable of secreting 100 g/L of homologous proteins into a defined cultivation medium under optimized fermentation conditions. As these levels are generally better than other organisms, the secretory capabilities of filamentous fungi make them candidates as production hosts for recombinant proteins on an industrial scale. However, this industrialization goal 73 has yet to be achieved for mAbs. Engineering of Myceliophthora thermophila C1 has focused on reduction of proteases to increase yield of intact antibody and glycoengineering for secretion of mAbs with mammalian glycoforms. Expression levels reaching 24.5 g/L and rates up to 3.5 g/L/day have been reported. 74 xisting infrastructure, including 300,000 L bioreactors currently used for manufacturing enzymes and food could potentially -depending on regulatory considerations and need -be multipurpose, including for the manufacture of mAbs.

One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources. \n\nAdvances in antibody production technologies have made giant strides over the last few decades. In 1985, average fed-batch titers were approximately 0.20 g/L, which since then have grown over 1600%, achieving projected average fed-batch titers of 3.20 g/L. 3 However, some literature sources have reported fed-batch titers as high as 10 g/L in 14-18 day processes, indicating that the pace of fed-batch productivity advancements is picking up speed. 4,5 These rising yields can be attributed to incremental advances in cell line engineering, 6 improved process control, 4 and advanced media development within the biopharmaceutical industry. 7 Although reported yields are steadily growing, with the mAb market greatly expanding, the appetite for further bioreactor productivity advancements is higher than ever. To meet this demand, a paradigm shift toward intensified processing is required to make these substantial productivity gains rather than relying on the incremental technological step changes of the past. \n\nOne appealing and highly productive platform process that has gained momentum in recent years is the intensified or high inoculation density (HID) fed-batch bioreactor.",

            "text": "Specific molecule design strategies, e.g. knobs-into-holes technology combined with CrossMab technology greatly enhances correct chain association (8,9). Additional progress was achieved by excluding position-specific effects by using targeted integration (TI) host(s), allowing for homogeneous gene expression via integrating predefined expression vectors in the TI landing pad (10,11). Regardless, the manufacturing yields of complex antibody formats are lower than monoclonal antibodies, making them 'difficult-to-express' (DTE). \n\nCHO cells serve as the preferred expression system for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins (12). During the development of stable recombinant CHO cell lines, high-producing clones are generated and tested extensively to identify lead clone(s) for commercial manufacturing use. Notably, clone performance early during the cell line development process and at small scales (shake flask, multiwells) is not necessarily predictive of industrial scale performance (13). Constant changes in CHO genome via rearrangements and DNA methylation patterns result in large diversity of genotypes spontaneously arising in CHO cell populations (14). This instability is a constant and unpredictable feature with no population being stable or uniform over an extended period of time (15,16). However, the success of CHO cells in biomanufacturing is at least partly based on this flexibility to adapt to any given environment quickly (17). Importantly, once cells have physiologically adapted to their new environment, i.e. the bioreactor set-up, their phenotype remains stable, as long as this environment is kept (17). The field is, therefore, relying on miniaturized microbioreactor (MBR) systems as downscale models to closely mimic the production process of current good manufacturing practice in large-scale bioreactors (18). The MBR systems have been shown to reproduce the performance of CHO clones under conventional bioreactor production conditions (with regulated pH, dissolved oxygen, CO 2 and nutrition levels) (19). \n\nThe increasing demand of high-value DTE molecules is illustrated by more than 100 bsAbs currently in clinical trials, which underlines the need for developing high-yield expression systems.",

            "text": "Proteins play crucial roles in living organisms, including humans, to enable a large number of fundamental processes, such as cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, cell division and cell growth and differentiation. The continuous progress in biotechnology, including genetic and protein engineering, in the last few decades has made it possible to manipulate different platforms for the commercial-scale production of proteins in transgenic bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, insects, mammalian and plant cell cultures and transgenic animals and plants. These biotechnological advances have significantly affected many industries, including food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, enzyme, hormone, textile, leather, paper, pulp, polymer, plastics and agriculture industries. For example, there are more than 200 approved peptide and protein pharmaceuticals in the US Food and Drug Administration list, including human insulin, serum albumin, human growth hormone, various antibodies, edible vaccines, collagen, human epidermal growth factor and blood coagulating protein (Factor VIII), among many others. \n\nOf the different recombinant proteins that are produced on a commercial scale, 39% are made in Escherichia coli, 35% in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 15% in yeasts, 10% by other mammalian systems and 1% by other bacteria and systems (Rader 2008). Microorganisms and cell cultures are robust recombinant protein synthesis production systems. They possess certain challenges, however, such as high culture development costs, high cell culture maintenance costs, cell culture variability and limitations concerning the production of large molecular weight proteins. \n\nIn principle, DNA from any source can be manipulated in any living system. Genetically engineered animals have been created that produce recombinant proteins in their tissues, milk, blood or urine (http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=q0WCjX8jUE4). By the late 1980s, it was shown that transgenic plants could be used as alternative, commercial-scale, recombinant protein production platforms, after immunoglobulins and the assembly of functional antibodies were successfully achieved at 1.3% of the total leaf protein in tobacco leaves (Hiatt et al. 1989).",

            "text": "The biological production of bioactive designed proteins in bulk quantities is one of the methods to meet the growing needs in the protein-related market and industries. Reducing production costs in mass production systems is a major challenge for all manufacturing companies. Among the recombinant protein production platforms, transplastomic plant-made pharmaceuticals are highly demanded and can be one of the most cost-effective routes for meeting the needs of rapidly growing recombinant drug companies. Although the currently used production systems based on mammalian, insect, yeast, or bacterial cell cultures have been developed and improved in accordance with current good manufacturing practice [1], plant-based protocols are facing some ups and downs in the commercialization process. Here we examined the potential of lyophilization in the long-term storage of centrifugally compressed isolated chloroplasts as well as intact leaves by developing transplastomic tobacco plants expressing the antibody mimetic DARPin G3. It is assumed that the longevity and low-cost preservation methods remove any negative speculation on the efficiency of plant-based protocols in the formulation of any medicinal recipes. Typically, focusing on a small number of platforms makes meeting the unique requirements of certain target proteins difficult; this is especially true for recombinant proteins that are needed in small quantities for individual patients as well as large quantities for mass production or where rapid scale-up is required [2]. \n\nCompared to bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell culture systems, the production of pharmaceutical proteins in plants offers several advantages, including low cost, a high production rate, easy scale-up with relatively low demand and a simplified procedure, and importantly, a low risk of product contamination by human or animal pathogens and endotoxins, resulting in increased patient safety [3][4][5]. Additionally, plants are able to perform appropriate eukaryotic protein post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, folding, and multimeric assembly, which are frequently crucial for the biological activity and stability of many mammalian proteins [5][6][7].",

            "text": "LLPS of several purification intermediates provoke challenges to the drug substance manufacturing process of mAb-X Figure 1a (left panel) depicts the purification process developed for mAb-X, a human IgG1-\u03bb antibody. The mAb-X drug substance produced by the manufacturing process met product-quality specifications suitable for use in clinical studies. However, when the purification process intermediates were stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C, several of the intermediates showed distinct layers resulting in two clear liquid phases (Figure 1a, middle panel). After these intermediates were equilibrated to room temperature and mixed thoroughly, the intermediates became a single homogeneous optically clear phase, and no longer exhibited two liquid phases (data no shown). Once returned to 2 to 8\u00b0C, these intermediates initially became turbid, and then again separated into two phases, which is behavior indicative of LLPS. Both liquid phases contained mAb-X, but the upper phase contained mAb-X at concentrations of 1 to 3 mg/ mL, whereas the lower phase contained the antibody at concentrations of ~150 mg/mL. These observations were consistent with published literature pertaining to LLPS. 1,2,10,19 In large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs, purification intermediates are often kept at ambient temperature for brief intervals (e.g. up to 7 days), but a lower temperature (2-8\u00b0C) is often preferred for longer duration (e.g. more than 7 days). During storage, the aggregate level of mAb-X in the purification intermediates increased quickly when stored at ambient temperature; in contrast, the aggregation rate was reduced dramatically at refrigerator temperatures (Figure 1b). To maintain product quality, storing these intermediates at a refrigerated temperature is preferable, but, as detailed above, resulted in LLPS. \n\nWhen LLPS occurred in these intermediate process pools during storage, the lower phases were found to be highly viscous. The viscosity of the lower (heavy) phases remained exceptionally high (>100 cP) even after the solutions were warmed to room temperature. Mixing these highly viscous heterogeneous intermediates at large-scale and achieving solution homogeneity was time-consuming.",

Using both multiplexed immunoassays and cation exchange (CIeX) chromatography, cell culture supernatants generated using our system were assessed for stability of expression and ratios of the component antibodies over time. Cultures expressing combinations of three to ten antibodies maintained consistent expression levels and stable ratios of component antibodies for at least 60 days. Cultures showed remarkable reproducibility following cell banking, and aaV-based cultures showed higher stability and productivity than non-aaV based cultures. Therefore, this non-viral aaV-based expression platform represents a predictable, reproducible, quick and cost effective method to manufacture or quickly produce for preclinical testing recombinant antibody combination therapies and other recombinant protein mixtures. mabs Volume 6 Issue \n\nIn many cases, combinations of multiple antibodies have been shown to function synergistically, not additively, to achieve results that are not possible with mAbs alone, while allowing for a lower minimal effective dose. For example, antibodies that bind multiple epitopes can act synergistically to crosslink the signaling molecule epidermal growth factor receptor in cancer cells, 12 or bind the highly potent botulinum toxin with sufficiently high affinity for neutralization. 13 Some diseases are still treated with hyperimmune products, such as human or equine immunoglobulin products for rabies and botulism. 13,14 These biological products are often effective, but can be difficult to obtain, inconsistent, and lead to serum sickness. Mounting data confirms that antibody therapeutics are most efficacious when mAbs are strategically combined, mimicking the polyclonal response of the human immune system. \n\nAlthough there is growing acceptance of the effectiveness of the antibody combination therapeutic (ACT) approach, the cost of producing such complex antibody products using standard antibody manufacturing technology remains a substantial barrier. Because many of the current clinical trials are focused on combinations of mAbs previously approved for therapeutic use, these products are being manufactured using traditional methodology.",

Cell engineering technology can precisely control the relative expression of multiple functional gene components, which in turn affects protein yield. New therapeutic applications are opened up using new protein forms such as bispecific antibodies and fusion proteins. An understanding of the critical quality attributes of RTPs during CHO cell culture and their contributing factors is critical to the production of high quality RTPs. The proper assembly of these new RTPs may be more complex, which may affect productivity and potency. The solution strategy can start from the molecular design of proteins, combined with appropriate cell line, vector engineering and process optimization, based on the understanding of folding mechanism and the understanding of potential bottlenecks, optimize protein secretion and prevent aggregation, maximize the yield of recombinant proteins, reduce large-scale production costs, and promote the development of biopharmaceuticals.",

            "text": "2][3][4][5] Quality and yield of the recombinant protein are critical parameters when considering industrial scale manufacturing for therapeutic usage. Although several organisms can be considered for recombinant protein expression, mammalian cells are often preferred for proteins that require post-translational modifications. Numerous strategies have been developed to increase the yield of recombinant proteins obtained from expression in mammalian cells. 6,7 8][29][30][31] However, although the final protein encoded by an optimized DNA sequence has the same amino acid composition, the modifications that are introduced might alter proper protein folding, solubility and activity by modifying the dynamics of protein translation. 32,33 Indeed, low frequency codons located at certain positions can be important to slow down translation and avoid ribosome 'traffic jams' or to pause translation for correct folding of the nascent polypeptide and membrane targeting of cell surface proteins. 11,12,34,35 n additional level of complexity arises when expressing protein complexes composed of different polypeptides. In this situation, over-or under-expression of one or several polypeptides can lead to a decrease in production of the final protein complex and the accumulation of partially assembled complexes. Monoclonal antibodies, which are composed of four disulfide-linked polypeptides (two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains), represent a relevant example given their importance both as research tools and as a class of drugs. Production of several grams per liter can be routinely achieved using fed-batch fermentation of stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. 5,36 The correlation between the level of light chain expression and antibody titer, as well as the presence of free light chains in the culture supernatant, suggest that the heavy and light chains are not expressed or assembled in a stoichiometric manner. 37,38 The situation is even more complex for the expression of bispecific antibodies that often require the expression of three or four different polypeptides and the formation of heterodimers to incorporate two specificities within a single molecule.",

The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies.",

            "text": "Recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins (rBPs) have revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry (Dahodwala and Lee 2019;Zhang et al., 2021). Since 2016, about 70% of all rBPs and mAbs were produced from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, which are attributed to their robust growth and potential to produce non-immunogenic antibodies with similar glycosylation patterns to those of human antibodies (Lalonde and Durocher 2017;Dahodwala and Lee 2019;MacDonald et al., 2021). Meanwhile, at the current approval rate of four new products a year, more than 70 mAbs were on the market by 2020, and the world-wide sales will reach $125 billion (Ecker et al., 2015;Bhatti and Salama 2018). Compared with most of the small molecular drugs, mAbs feature with some advantages such as reduced off-target effects, greater surface area for binding, etc. (Shepard et al., 2017;Ha et al., 2022). In order to improve the competitiveness of one mAb product, the mAb titer needs to be improved to elevate the economic effectiveness (Ha et al., 2022). Therefore, it is essential to develop advanced technology by process engineering, optimization, and control strategies. \n\nNowadays, fed-batch and perfusion cell cultures are the two current processes of the large-scale industrial production of mAbs and rBPs (Zhuang et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2018;Schulze et al., 2022). Generally, scaling of the fed-batch process needs larger and more rigid layouts which limits its application (Karst et al., 2016;MacDonald et al., 2021). The membrane-based alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) technology is the most commonly used cell retention method in perfusion cultures to increase cells density and mAbs productivity (Genzel et al., 2014;Gr\u00e4nicher et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The slow progression of recombinant protein production in the biopharmaceutical industry is mainly due to the low productivity of host cell lines [1][2][3]. One major challenge in generating highproducing cell lines is the lengthy selection process which typically takes six to nine months by the traditional method of cloning by limiting dilution [4]. \n\nHowever, over several rounds of amplifications, these high producers are prone to copy number loss, which introduces variability in productivity levels [5,6]. The resulting productivity instability has been characterized by the combination of an imbalance in chromosome number, an absence of TTAGGG n sequence, the rearrangement of targeted genes to transcriptionally inactive sites and the methylation of promoters at CpG dinucleotides [7][8][9]. Regardless, it seems evident from earlier studies that high copy numbers will not necessarily result in high productivity [9][10][11], which suggests that the cause of decreased productivity is not restricted to the genetic level. \n\nWhile several research groups [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] found that high productivity was strongly associated with an abundance of recombinant transcript level, Smales et. al., (2004) did not observe this correlation. The lack of correlation was postulated to be due to the limited resources of processing and secretory apparatus during the folding and assembly step that primarily takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [21]. Certain transcription regulators, such as X-box binding protein (X-BP1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and ER proteins, including binding protein (BiP), protein disulphide isomerise (PDI) and glucoseregulated proteins 94 (GRP94), have been shown to influence the ER expansion during protein synthesis and thus affecting the secretion rate of antibody [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33].",

            "text": "Recently, we reported that co-utilization of glycerol and lactose promotes recombinant protein expression and increases viability compared to a mixed-feed with glucose 17,18 . Unlike glucose, glycerol is integrated into glycolysis and gluconeogenesis 17,18 . Results of other studies also indicate altered TCA-activity on glycerol compared to glucose metabolism potentially favoring recombinant protein production [19][20][21] . \n\nFor E. coli bioprocesses it is known that batch and fed-batch cultivations result in unwanted variable, timedependent productivity 22 , however these processing modes are still state-of-the-art for industrial applications. Time-independent processing would reduce batch to batch variations and consequently allow stable productivity and robust downstream processing 23,24 . Furthermore, a change from fed-batch to continuous manufacturing would allow a reduction in scale and operating costs and thus should be pursued as the most efficient cultivation technique [25][26][27] . However, solutions for continuous cultivation with E. coli have not been realized yet, since subpopulations evolve over elongated cultivation times 13,[28][29][30] , which are yet to be investigated 13,31 . \n\nPrevious studies highlighted a cascaded continuous operating system using two bioreactors, to reduce subpopulation formation compared to common continuous cultivations (i.e. chemostat, turbidostat, etc.) 13,[32][33][34] . Even though a spatial separation of biomass formation and recombinant protein production seems promising, the effects of process parameters on productivity in such a cascaded continuous cultivation are barely known 10,35 . Further, long-term effects beyond 100 h of induction and thus the potential for continuous manufacturing with E. coli have not been investigated yet 32,34,36 because the development of continuous processes is highly time-and resource-dependent. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the cascaded continuous cultivation with a T7-based E. coli host over extended cultivation times of more than 220 h using cell specific productivity as a key performance indicator to determine cell equilibrium state.",

Current production methods may face limitations in scalability, yield, and cost; developing scalable and cost-effective production processes, optimizing purification methods, and minimizing production-related impurities are necessary to ensure affordability and accessibility of these materials (Rice et al., 1993;Meyer and Chilkoti, 1999b;Mayer et al., 1999;Lojewska et al., 2016;Faravelli et al., 2021). Notably, the differences between the used expressing systems, such as post-translational modification and protein folding, profoundly affect the structure and functions of products as well, necessitating the systematic study to compare expressing systems in order to choose the optimized one for scale production (Fan et al., 2012;Gecchele et al., 2015). \n\nRegulatory approval for clinical translation and commercialization of recombinant biomaterials involves navigating complex pathways governed by regulatory agencies such as the EMA, FDA or NMPA, which is challenging and time-consuming. Meeting stringent safety and efficacy standards, conducting comprehensive preclinical and clinical studies, and demonstrating long-term safety profiles are critical steps in the regulatory approval process. Furthermore, ensuring compliance with quality assurance and quality control standards throughout the manufacturing process is essential for obtaining regulatory clearance and market approval. Thus, collaborations between academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are essential for streamlining the regulatory process and accelerating the translation of promising technologies into clinical practice and commercial products.",

            "text": "Although the ability of plants to produce biopharmaceutically relevant proteins at high quality has been demonstrated in multiple cases, only few plant-based biopharmaceuticals have been investigated in clinical trials or have reached the market thus far (Table 1). Key reasons may be insufficient yields (at least for first-generation recombinant proteins generated by transgenic approaches), high purification costs and regulatory barriers. Yields can be increased by using potent expression vectors that allow the generation of products in milligram amounts within several days post-DNA-construct delivery. In addition, high productivity can be achieved by plastomic and seed-based expression, opening the road to new applications, particularly in oral delivery 18,19,113 . However, plastomic and seed-based production may not be suitable for secretory proteins with complex post-translational modifications because these production approaches usually do not provide all required modifications such as complex glycosylation. A crucial step in the production procedure is downstream processing, which, although optimized for whole plants 37,114,115 , remains challenging owing to the accumulation of recombinant proteins within cellular networks (with the exception of less efficient systems such as hydroponic cultivation and rhizosecretion). Purification typically involves homogenization of plant tissue to release the target protein, which also causes the release of large quantities of host proteins and other plant components. The subsequent clarification of plant homogenates requires additional steps, increasing the costs of downstream processing; for example, the production of a purified monoclonal antibody using transgenic tobacco costs approximately \u20ac 1,000 per gram, for which the downstream process costs represent >80% 37,114 . The calculations are in line with techno-economic analyses (TEAs) demonstrating that purification steps take the main share 116 .\n\nTEAs can define a manufacturing process for the evaluation of commercial viability, which is particularly important for a non-traditional process such as plant-based manufacturing. However, owing to the breadth of methodology (for example, different production platforms, production hosts, indoor and field propagation), only a limited number of TEAs are currently available (Table 2), which cover only a few plant-based manufacturing methodologies 117 .

            "text": "Integrated continuous biomanufacturing of therapeutic proteins has gained a lot of interest over the past decade in the biopharmaceutical industry. In an integrated continuous bioprocess (ICB), a perfusion bioreactor with a mammalian cell line is coupled to a continuous downstream process (DSP). With increasing volumetric productivities from high cell density perfusion cultures and improved resin utilization in continuous chromatography, it offers potential economic benefits over conventional batch processing strategies (Pollock et al., 2017). Uncertainties in future market demands of biotherapeutic products have further led to questioning the lack of flexibility of large-scale stainless-steel plants (Walther et al., 2015). For example, the outbreak of a pandemic, such as recently the coronavirus disease , can lead to capacity limitations of antibody production in fed-batch processes (Coffman et al., 2021). \n\nThe much faster implementation of an ICB in comparison to the construction of a new large-scale stainless-steel plant, allows for a rapid response in manufacturing to such public health threats. Scaleout of several ICB units run in parallel as well as increase in total run time of the process, can rapidly be achieved if the demand for a biotherapeutic product changes (FDA, 2019), thus offering greater flexibility than traditional batch processes. This paradigm shift to integrated and continuous processing has been further expanded by including the design principles of using only single-use equipment, closed processing and a \"ballroom arrangement\" in the new \"biofacility of the future\" (Klutz et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The product quality and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of antibodies obtained with batch and on-demand reconstituted media were identically measured using sheathless CE-MS (Figure 9). 9). The glycosylation pattern between continuous on-demand and batchwise reconstitution showed only minor differences that are within the expected batch to batch variations for pharmaceutical mAb production (Planinc et al., 2017;Upton et al., 2019). Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the levels of afucosylation (Figure 9). The amount of afucosylation is an important CQA because it leads to a high ADCC activation (Ferrara et al., 2006;Li et al., 2017). Regarding other PTMs no differences were observed between the two evaluated conditions. Summarizing, using the device for a continuous on-demand reconstitution, we were able to continuously prepare medium for 12 h with a reconstitution rate of 0.475 L h \u22121 . By operating at the lower limits of our miniaturized 3D developed device (19 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 cm), we could theoretically supply continuous on-demand fresh medium for a 15 L perfusion bioreactor with a working volume of 10 L operating at 1 VVD. In addition, we believe that a nonintegrated stand-alone version of our developed system similar to already existing automated buffer preparation units could also substantially contribute to the reduction of preparation and storage costs of cell culture media (Carredano et al., 2018;Gibson et al., 2019). The trend of outsourcing media and buffer preparation increased in the last decade, and we believe that an on-demand reconstitution directly from solids would position itself on the biotherapeutic manufacturing and supplier of process materials side and by that reduce the logistical pressure (Langer, 2016). As the developed device is also easily scalable, we offer a flexible solution for large scale media preparation but also to make continuous processes such as the perfusion technology more easily available for existing fed-batch facilities (Lin et al., 2017); thus, extending the continuous idea into the auxiliary equipment's of buffer and media preparation (Figure 10).",

            "text": "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

            "text": "Global antivenom shortage has prompted several lines of research aimed at finding solutions to the main production bottlenecks. \n\nThe use of immunization with DNA or with recombinantexpressed epitopes of relevant toxins is an example of this, aimed at circumventing the shortage of antigens in species with low venom yield, such as coral snakes (Ramos et al., 2016). In comparison, fully recombinant strategies can provide a more satisfactory solution in the long term, addressing not only the shortage of antigens, but also other problems arising from current therapies such as adverse reactions and reproducibility (Laustsen et al., 2016). In theory, rationally designed cocktail formulations made of recombinant mAbs could outperform animal plasma-derived antivenoms, as the composition of the latter comprises a large fraction (\u226580%) of immunologically irrelevant antitoxin antibodies. In contrast, by adjusting the antivenom composition to a minimal number of selected functional components, the safety profile can be improved and manufacturing costs can be reduced. Minimal recombinant antibody cocktails comprising only three mAbs antibodies against the main Bothrops toxins were shown to neutralize the lethal toxicity of the venom (Frauches et al., 2013), indicating that oligoclonal cocktails are suitable antivenom formulations at least in some cases. Notwithstanding, a potent cocktail would probably require more complex combinations, incorporating antibodies against minor toxins, which could act alone or synergistically with other toxins, to ensure the coverage of intra-and interspecific variation. Complex cocktail composition imposes serious constraints on current manufacturing systems. Indeed, whereas the formulation of improved cocktails seems an accessible objective with current antibody selection techniques, the lack of suitable production systems for these combinations has proved a practical limitation, discouraging further advances. The pluribody strategy is in line with other recent strategies based on mammalian cell cultures aimed to produce affordable antibody cocktails (Laustsen, 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2012), which can foster the development of improved recombinant formulations. The employ of plant virus-based expression systems offers further advantages associated with the use of plants as biofactories.",

            "text": "There is a current trend in biomanufacturing to move from batch to continuous processing (Bisschops & Brower, 2013;Godawat et al., 2015;Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015). This shift offers a number of potential advantages, such as greater efficiency, improved product quality, decreased production costs and a smaller equipment footprint. It also increases the flexibility for a manufacturer to produce both large and small volume biopharmaceuticals and to adjust production capacity to demands (Croughan et al., 2015;Zydney, 2015). Manufacturers can produce more easily stable proteins as well as labile enzymes and clotting factors that cannot tolerate the bulk harvest hold times often associated with batch manufacturing. Perfusion bioreactors equipped with cell retention devices have been used to create a continuous upstream process. Increased expression levels of recombinant proteins in a continuous upstream create a bottleneck between the upstream and downstream processes (Jungbauer, 2013). Capture columns, such as a Protein A column for monoclonal antibodies, can be increased in size or cycled multiple times during a batch to mitigate the bottleneck; however, for many reasons, these approaches are unsatisfactory (Bisschops & Brower, 2013). Continuous processing using multi-column chromatography can successfully integrate the upstream process with the downstream process and ultimately lead to steady-state manufacturing (Bisschops & Brower, 2013;Ichihara et al., 2018;Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015). A number of chromatographic systems have been developed for continuous product capture including the periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) and simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB) systems (Zydney, 2016;Bryntesson et al., 2011;Godawat et al., 2012). Chromatographic unit operations run in flow-through mode are often used as polishing steps in the purification of biologics and adapt well to a continuous process (Weaver et al., 2013;Ichihara et al., 2018). Operation in flow-through mode usually enables higher column loading and results in a more robust unit operation (Shukla et al., 2007).",

Downstream processing is often based on size exclusion chromatography and ultra-centrifugation that might face challenges in large-scale set-ups (Effio & Hubbuch, 2015;Tayyab et al., 1991). Another challenge is low binding capacities during chromatography in bind-and-elute mode (Effio & Hubbuch, 2015). \n\nTo overcome some of the production challenges and to intensify the production of VLP vaccines, platform technologies have been developed that allow the production of a variety of VLPs while only requiring minimal adjustments of the underlying production process (Middelberg et al., 2011). One possible pathway is to produce VLPs and antigens separately and subsequently attach them either by conjugation or by tag coupling approaches (Brune et al., 2016). \n\nAnother pathway is genetic fusion in which the antigen is genetically inserted into the viral structural protein with subsequent protein expression as one construct (Clarke et al., 1987;Sapsford et al., 2013). \n\nAn advanced platform technology for VLP vaccines involves the use of murine poliomavirus major capsid protein VP1 with inserted antigen (Middelberg et al., 2011). VLP vaccines based on this platform showed promising results in animal studies for pathogens such as Influenza, Group A Streptococcus, and Rotavirus (Anggraeni et al., 2013;Seth et al., 2016;Tekewe et al., 2017). The capsomeres can be expressed unassembled in gram-per-liter concentration in Escherichia coli and a highly efficient, scalable, and integrated purification and production pathways have been developed (Gerstweiler et al., 2021c;Liew et al., 2010). \n\nContinuous bio-processing promises process intensification due to higher automation, increased equipment utilization and a reduced facility footprint, and furthermore leads to constant product quality and less batch-to-batch variation. A review on current developments of continuous bio-manufacturing has been recently published (Gerstweiler et al., 2021a).",

            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals play an important role in today's medical treatments and healthcare. The market share of biopharmaceuticals, mainly monoclonal antibodies, increased vastly over the last decade, and is also forecasted to increase further in the future (Walsh and Walsh 2022;Farid et al. 2020;Lu et al. 2020), although mRNA technologies (Urquhart 2022) as well as bispecific antibodies (Ma et al. 2021;Lu et al. 2020) are gaining momentum. Coinciding with the rising market volumes, productivities should equally rise to meet the demand. In the past, this was achieved predominately by improving volumetric productivities, i.e., improvements of cultivation conditions for increasing viable cell density and consequently volumetric product formation rates. Nowadays, antibody titers of 5 g/L up to well over 10 g/L can be reached (Liang et al. 2023;Mah\u00e9 et al. 2022;Handlogten et al. 2018;Shukla et al. 2017), especially using perfusion processes (McDonnell et al. 2022;Liang et al. 2023;Ding et al. 2022). However, such approaches may reach technical limits of bioreactors (Ozturk 1996) leading to an increased focus on cellspecific productivity (Farid et al. 2020;Ozturk 1996;Becker et al. 2019a, b;Wijaya et al. 2021;Verhagen et al. 2020a, b;Torres and Dickson 2022). Previous research indicated a correlation between cell-specific productivity and the cell cycle. Mainly, the G1 phase was associated with an increase of cell-specific productivity (Hendrick et al. 2001;Dutton et al. 2006;Park et al. 2016;Fussenegger et al. 1997).",

            "text": "In particular, the large-scale industrial production of protein medications is an expensive process that requires careful selection of an effective host for the protein production, which will provide proper post-translational modifications, thorough optimization of cultivation and extraction processes, as well as the development of proper purification systems and quality control tests. \n\nThe transition of protein biosynthesis and purification protocols from the standard biochemical laboratory to large-scale biotechnological production is hampered by many difficulties, however, the development of continuous bioreactors and chromatography systems within high-throughput systems allows us to establish reproducible techniques for the production of protein-and peptide-based medications. Recent developments in the industrial production of proteins have given rise to several types of protein-based drugs in the clinic, such as monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-HER2 IgG, trastuzumab, marketed under the trade name Herceptin, Roche, or anti-CD20 IgG, rituximab, marketed under the trade name Rituxan, MabThera), different enzymes (e.g., bovhyaluronidase azoximer marketed as Longidaze, Petrovaks), peptides (e.g., glucagon-like-1 peptide marketed as Levemir, Novo Nordisk), and human serum albumin nanoparticles (paclitaxel-loaded albumin nanoparticles Abraxane, Sanofi-Aventis), thus proving the efficiency of proteinbased medications and the possibility of their large-scale production [227][228][229][230]. Moreover, several complex organic nanoparticles, such as extracellular vesicles and protein particles are already undergoing clinical trials, thus confirming the achievability of large-scale production and purification of protein, lipid, and protein/lipid nanoparticles for clinical applications [231][232][233]. \n\nHowever, scaling up the biotechnological production of chemically synthesized nanoparticles often leads to poor batch-to-batch reproducibility and an increased polydispersity index.",

            "text": "In recent years, the biopharmaceutical industry has received much attention due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic [1]. A key factor in fighting the pandemic was the increased speed of development of novel vaccines and drug treatments against COVID-19 [2][3][4]. However, the recent pandemic revealed further drawbacks, mainly current therapeutic molecule manufacturing, which lacks highly flexible, productive, and robust processes that can be rolled out across production sites worldwide in a short time frame [5,6]. Interestingly, this type of process is not only lacking in terms of the rare case of a global pandemic, but also in ordinary biopharmaceutical production, which is facing an increasing quantity demand for pharmaceutical products and an overall increase in proteinbased therapeutics [7,8]. As a consequence, new and intensified production processes are needed that are flexible and easy to implement, have high volumetric productivities, and \n\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 1391 2 of 15 allow for efficient plant utilization. In this context, mAb production is suitable as a model system due to the existing platform processes as well as the long history of application. \n\nmAb-based products are generally produced utilizing mammalian cell lines like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. This is due to their unique ability to generate appropriate post-translational modifications for human applications, their status as a safe host, and their well-known scale-up characteristics [9]. Currently, established production operations like fed-batch (FB) and perfusion formats are applied for the industrial production of mAb products. Both process formats have their own advantages and disadvantages with respect to biopharmaceutical production. Perfusion processes have a long cultivation duration and high volumetric productivity; however, the development of perfusion processes takes a relatively long time and many resources, in addition to requiring more complex process control. These drawbacks make them unsuitable for emergency situations, like pandemics, where there is a need for rapid development and quick process transfer to global production facilities [10]. FB formats, on the other hand, have a short cultivation duration and lower development efforts in terms of time and resources, which allows for rapid process development and integration into existing production facilities.",

The lack of affinity resins for mAbs, such as protein A, is one unmet requirement. There are just a few options, and they are no longer cost-effective enough to be made single-use. As the industry matures, there is a strong prospect of expanding into other matrices and ingredients for those large bio-therapeutic particles. Simultaneously, the diversity and scope of single-use alternative implementation is becoming obvious and prevalent. Because the requirement to clean, sterilize, and validate the equipment/materials is reduced, the usage of such compounds in all production and purification procedures is gaining support [61]. \n\nScientists argue that the extremely concentrated state of global vaccine manufacturing capacity limits large-scale vaccine production. At the moment, only a few countries have the capacity to make vaccines on their own. Scaling up vaccine production is difficult, and a shortage of manufacturing sites is limiting global vaccine availability. Vaccine manufacturing and the development of breakthrough technologies capable of producing huge quantities of vaccines against known and undiscovered infections are difficult tasks nowadays.

In our case, this enabled the scale up of a highly productive (high titer) mAb production process in an existing facility by overcoming tank volume limitations. Minimizing pool volumes also had an economic impact as it helped to significantly reduce the size of the costly viral filter that followed the HIC step. Furthermore, removing ammonium sulfate from the manufacturing process helped reduce disposal costs and was considered more compatible with environmental considerations.

One option for intensified, rapid, and flexible biological manufacturing is high cell density perfusion cultures (Bielser et al. 2018;Chen et al. 2018). While recombinant protein production in perfusion mode has been established in the industry for many years (Konstantinov and Cooney 2015), virus production in perfusion mode is mainly pursued in academic research (Guti\u00e9rrez-Granados et al. 2018;Tapia et al. 2016). Viruses such as influenza virus (Genzel et al. 2014;Petiot et al. 2011), attenuated yellow fever virus (Nikolay et al. 2018), adenovirus (Henry et al. 2004), lentivirus (Manceur et al. 2017), and modified vaccinia Ankara virus (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2019) have already been investigated for intensified production in perfusion culture. Using different setups, this technology has shown clear advantages, such as a higher volumetric productivity compared with batch processes. In case of influenza pandemics, intensified cell culture-based perfusion cultures allowing a rapid and small footprint production of viruses could be of particular interest (Hegde 2015). \n\nMembrane-based alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) is to date the most commonly used cell retention technology for recombinant protein production such as monoclonal antibodies (Bielser et al. 2018). For virus production, however, virus particle size, half-life of infectious virions, and surface properties have to be considered, and the most suitable cell retention technology cannot be derived from the previous work with recombinant proteins. In addition, the lytic cycle of many viruses shortens the process time while increasing host cell-derived impurity levels in the supernatant. \n\nMany cell retention devices are available for animal cell culture including ATF systems, tangential flow filtration (TFF) systems, inclined and acoustic settlers, and hydrocyclones (Patil and Walther 2018;Voisard et al. 2003).",

Outsidethe-lab scenarios have wide-ranging challenges and requirements for synthetic biology that are more demanding than typical laboratory settings. This figure provides a basic overview of major challenges and requirements associated with four major outside-the-lab settings including: space missions, developing nations, military missions, and agricultural settings. Challenges and requirements common to all settings are listed in the center, and those specific to certain outside-the-lab settings are listed in their respective boxes. production applications. At their core, on-demand and continuous production functionalities entail the preservation and maintenance of metabolic activity in diverse settings. This requires field-deployable platforms to be genetically and environmentally stable, both while in long-term storage and metabolically active states. In addition, coupling of enhanced platform stability with user-friendly deployment technologies (such as integrated production and purification modules and liquid handling capacities) is needed for deployment in settings with limited or no access to resources or experienced personnel (Fig. 2).\n\nWhole-cell production platforms. Traditional cell-based recombinant production platforms have served as the primary mode of production for protein therapeutics since the development of recombinant insulin in 1982 25 and continue to be used for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients 26 . However, the reliance on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell platforms for production 27 poses issues for the development of rapid and shelf-stable on-demand production platforms given the lack of mammalian cell viability following harsh preservation procedures such as freeze drying 28 as well as drastically slower accumulation of biomass compared to other hosts such as yeast.

            "text": "Ever increasing demands for vaccination and gene therapy have raised the need to develop efficient large-scale manufacturing processes, including cell culture-based virus production (Kaemmerer 2018;Rappuoli and Hanon 2018). One option for intensified, rapid, and flexible biological manufacturing is high cell density perfusion cultures (Bielser et al. 2018;Chen et al. 2018). While recombinant protein production in perfusion mode has been established in the industry for many years (Konstantinov and Cooney 2015), virus production in perfusion mode is mainly pursued in academic research (Guti\u00e9rrez-Granados et al. 2018;Tapia et al. 2016). Viruses such as influenza virus (Genzel et al. 2014;Petiot et al. 2011), attenuated yellow fever virus (Nikolay et al. 2018), adenovirus (Henry et al. 2004), lentivirus (Manceur et al. 2017), and modified vaccinia Ankara virus (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2019) have already been investigated for intensified production in perfusion culture. Using different setups, this technology has shown clear advantages, such as a higher volumetric productivity compared with batch processes. In case of influenza pandemics, intensified cell culture-based perfusion cultures allowing a rapid and small footprint production of viruses could be of particular interest (Hegde 2015). \n\nMembrane-based alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) is to date the most commonly used cell retention technology for recombinant protein production such as monoclonal antibodies (Bielser et al. 2018). For virus production, however, virus particle size, half-life of infectious virions, and surface properties have to be considered, and the most suitable cell retention technology cannot be derived from the previous work with recombinant proteins. In addition, the lytic cycle of many viruses shortens the process time while increasing host cell-derived impurity levels in the supernatant. \n\nMany cell retention devices are available for animal cell culture including ATF systems, tangential flow filtration (TFF) systems, inclined and acoustic settlers, and hydrocyclones (Patil and Walther 2018;Voisard et al. 2003).",

            "text": "DNA is fast to clinic, but requires rather high doses, making manufacturing a challenge. Also, the DNA vaccine requires manufacture of an electroporation device for delivery of the product, which adds significant cost and further limits supply availability. The production process is mature, so many CMOs [contract manufacturing organizations] exist that can make large quantities. \n\nLive viral vectors are proven technology, are generally scalable and have good yields. The process is fairly simple and the downstream purification is minimal, allowing higher yields/recovery. One drawback is that these vectors generally require cold chain (-20 to -80 \u00b0C) to preserve the viral activity. \n\nManufacturing for subunit protein vaccines is well established, and for S protein in the trimeric form the proteins are very stable, even at elevated temperatures. They require an adjuvant to boost immune response, and in most cases capacity of adjuvant is more limiting than our capacity to make the recombinant protein. The products are highly purified, which reduces yield of production to some extent, but the processes are still able to exceed 1,000 doses per liter (up to 5,000 doses per liter). R.R.: Manufacturing of hundreds of millions or billions of doses will be a big challenge for all vaccines, especially for the new ones, such as those based on nucleic acids and viral vectors, that have never been manufactured in large quantities. Fortunately, an unprecedented amount of money is being invested at risk to accelerate the scale-up of these platforms. However, we know that industrialization of vaccine manufacturing takes time, and it is not done until it is done. So, while we all hope that we will be successful, we need to continue to be prepared for surprises.",

However, one of the major bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs is how to perform high-level expression and production of recombinant antibodies. The high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies in CHO cells is determined by multiple factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of several state-of-the-art approaches, such as optimization of gene sequence of antibody, construction and optimization of high-efficiency expression vector, using antibody expression system, transformation of host cell lines, and glycosylation modification. Finally, the authors discuss the potential of large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes for biopharmaceutical manufacturing in the future.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant therapeutic proteins has become increasingly popular for the large-scale manufacturing of medical-grade biotherapeutics [1][2][3]. Although Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast are the most established organisms for biomanufacturing of recombinant proteins, production in mammalian cells has considerable advantages, particularly for complex protein products [3,4]. When produced in mammalian cells, recombinant human proteins undergo more accurate post-translational processing, which is crucial for proteins that require complicated tertiary structures to exhibit biological activity [3,[5][6][7]. Compared to the simpler expression systems of E. coli and yeast, one of the biggest drawbacks of using mammalian cells can be the more stringent culture conditions, which can also involve anchorage-dependent growth with less efficient two-dimensional (2D) cultures. The 2D culture systems are reliable and well defined, but the limited growth surface area places them at a disadvantage with respect to large-scale production. Over the past two decades, much effort has been directed at adapting mammalian cell expression systems for more efficient three-dimensional (3D) culture in suspension. This has been Gels 2023, 9, 243 2 of 24 achieved by either adapting the mammalian cells to continuous cell lines (CCLs), such as with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that can grow directly in suspension, or growing the mammalian cells with microcarriers [8][9][10]. Whereas certain mammalian cell types that are anchorage-dependent may not be able to conform to suspension culture, most anchorage-dependent cells can grow in or on microcarriers. \n\nThe manufacturing capacity of systems using anchorage-dependent mammalian cells has become a critical issue in the development of protein-based therapeutics. As new therapeutic proteins produced in these cells are introduced, 2D systems are initially used for making high-quality products with sufficient production yields for achieving the research and development goals. As the biotherapeutic reaches the clinical phases of development, efficient bioprocessing using large-scale, state-of-the-art manufacturing paradigms becomes essential.",

Numerous factors such as cell substrate, virus strain or expression system, medium, cultivation system, cultivation method, and scale need consideration. Reviewing options for efficient and economical production of human vaccines, this paper discusses basic factors relevant for viral antigen production in mammalian cells, avian cells and insect cells. In addition, bioreactor concepts, including static systems, single-use systems, stirred tanks and packed-beds are addressed. On this basis, methods towards process intensification, in particular operational strategies, the use of perfusion systems for high product yields, and steps to establish continuous processes are introduced.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are massively used in medicine as diagnostic reagents, drugs or vaccines. Moreover, the rapid discovery of new pharmaceutical proteins leads to an increased demand for their production [1]. To date, pro-duction of recombinant proteins mainly relies on microbial fermentation or on insect and mammalian cell cultures. These systems allow highly controlled manufacturing procedures essential for product quality. However, they have disadvantages in term of cost and scalability. \n\nPathogen contamination of animal cell cultures also represent an important safety issue. \n\nPlants are now being recognised as an alternative system for the production of recombinant proteins. Plant expression systems allow large scale production of recombinant proteins with accurate folding and assembly of protein complexes [2][3][4][5]. Importantly, plant systems offer the possibility of lowering production costs by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to traditional systems [1,6]. Chloroplasts have proven a useful cellular compartment for protein accumulation owing to their large size and number. Moreover, transplastomic plants (produced by introducing DNA into the chloroplast genome) enable high yields in recombinant proteins due to a high transgene copy number and limited epigenetic phenomena [7,8]. Contamination of wild and crop species by pollen flow is also largely circumvented by organellar transformation [7]. \n\nImportant issues for industrial production of plantderived recombinant proteins are extraction and purification [9]. Standard protocols include homogenisation of plant biomass followed by chromatographic methods. However, high abundance of secondary compounds, especially in tobacco, is problematic for chromatographic procedures. Therefore, developing a cost-effective preliminary (or alternative) purification step is required [6]. \n\nThe chloroplast has several interior compartments: the envelope membranes, the thylakoid membranes and lumen, the stroma and plastoglobules. So far, the stroma has been the major target for protein accumulation in plastids [8].",

Genetic engineering and recombinant biotechnology are changing pharma's perspective toward peptide therapeutics, as genetically engineered proteins offered a window to previously untreatable medical conditions that convinced this industry to conform with the need to develop drugs that could not be administered through the oral route; it also motivated an intense search for alternative (to injection) drug delivery platforms to meet patient's acceptability, and offers an useful alternative to chemical production of large (>40 AA) peptides, whose synthesis is challenging and expensive, even at low scale; hence, recombinant biotechnology will play an increasingly important role in peptide manufacturing mainly due to quantity requirements (Lax, 2010). Still, biotechnology will complement, and not replace, chemical peptide synthesis in the production of peptide therapeutics: cost of large-scale peptide chemical synthesis, in particular through the most popular solid\u2212phase procedures based on Fmoc\u2212chemistry, has significantly decreased over the past 15 years, mainly due to technological evolution of automated synthesizers and chromatographic systems; moreover, many highly specific and potent peptide therapeutics require daily doses of only a few micrograms; furthermore, when applicable, chemical peptide synthesis is more easily scalable for manufacturing at up to a multi\u221210 kg or 100\u2212kg scale, and is less demanding in terms of process development, and less personnel intensive in terms of production, quality assurance and regulatory affairs; last, but not least, chemical approaches are far superior to biotechnological ones regarding flexibility in the design of analogs requiring unnatural amino acids or non\u2212proteogenic building blocks (Lax, 2010). \n\nIn summary, peptide therapeutics are reaching a maturity level that emphasizes their potential interest against a wide diversity of medical challenges.",

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are commonly prepared for biomanufacturing by single cell cloning post-transfection and recovery, followed by lead clone screening, generation of a research cell bank (RCB), cell culture process development, and manufacturing of a master cell bank (MCB) to be used in early phase clinical manufacturing. In this study, it was found that an additional round of cloning and clone selection from an established monoclonal RCB or MCB (i.e., re-cloning) significantly improved titer for multiple late phase monoclonal antibody upstream processes. Quality attributes remained comparable between the processes using the parental clones and the re-clones. For two CHO cells expressing different antibodies, the re-clone performance was successfully scaled up at 500-L or at 2000-L bioreactor scales, demonstrating for the first time that the re-clone is suitable for late phase and commercial manufacturing processes for improvement of titer while maintaining comparable product quality to the early phase process.",

In a continuous approach, 14,15 mAbs are produced in a perfusion bioreactor, captured directly on Protein A columns a\ue09der passing a cell removal device, and subsequently processed in other downstream process steps without any hold times or interruptions in between the different unit operations. In a traditional scenario using fed-batch reactors, loaded mass can generally be estimated by taking into account column capacity and predetermined product titers. In the continuous production approach, titers in the cell-free harvest vary during the loading phase and in different puri\ue103cation cycles. Real-time titer measurements must therefore be carried out. 7][18] Both methods are time-consuming and typically carried out in an off-line setting.",

            "text": "Within the next years, the biopharmaceutical industry will face several challenges due to changing markets. Several prominent blockbuster drugs have already lost their patent protection, and others will follow soon, while at the same time, it is becoming harder to find new promising candidates (Walsh, 2018). This is forcing industry leaders to adapt to new trends, such as personalized medicine, but also offers great opportunities for biosimilar producers. These changes force the industry to become more flexible towards lower production volumes and reduced turnover times between different production processes, thus causing higher cost pressure (Levine et al., 2012;Klutz et al., 2015;Lu et al., 2017). Here, continuous bioprocessing offers many advantages over traditional (fed-) batch manufacturing. \n\nWhile fed-batch processes are still the most common practice in biopharmaceutical production, recent studies have shown that continuous manufacturing can significantly improve production efficiency. One particular study calculated that continuous processing potentially reduces the cost of production by about 50% (Yang et al., 2019). One reason for this substantial decrease in cost is the intensification of the process in terms of high viable cell densities or extended culture duration and the resulting significant improvement in productivity (Xu et al., 2020). Simultaneously, the product quality can also be enhanced due to a more stable operation in a steady-state (Karst et al., 2017). Other advantages are the redundancy of the costly and timely scaling of the clinical to the manufacturing scale, as scaling for higher drug product volume can be achieved by either prolonging the manufacturing run or parallel operation of several continuous vessels. This results in a much smaller footprint in terms of equipment, energy, and (raw) materials, as well as facilities needed for production and reduced time to market (Croughan et al., 2015;Klutz et al., 2015;Hernandez, 2017). Finally, regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, are now promoting continuous over batch manufacturing (Langer and Rader, 2014;Lee, 2017). \n\nOn the contrary, continuous bioprocessing bears many challenges itself that must be addressed. One aspect is the increased risk of contamination caused by prolonged process times and the resulting increase of samples taken per batch.",

            "text": "is, in part, due to difficult requirements in bio-defense markets. The Phase 3 production target of 1,200 kg of antibody is large compared to other biologic products and revenue streams are not predictable. The worldwide market for biologics in 2009 was $95 billion with 130 biologic products, which is 11% of the total pharmaceutical market and 16% larger compared to the previous year [5]. Of these 130 molecules, 27 biopharmaceutical products had sales in excess of $1 billion of which 17 were manufactured by mammalian cell culture. Nine of these were antibody-based products, including full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and Fc-fusion proteins. Of the full-length antibodies, only three have production targets larger than those in Phase 3 (Figure 1). \n\nIn order to estimate the possibility of manufacturing 1,200 kg of antibody material, a simplified, estimation model was constructed that evaluates manufacturing processes with a range of titers (50-1500 mg/L) and a range of bioreactor sizes (500-25,000 L). Antibody production output is shown in Figure 2. This estimation model assumes eight dedicated production reactors of any given size, production culture durations of 13 days, with a 1-day turn around, resulting in a 2-week cycle time, and 70% downstream yield. This model identified a number of configurations that are able to satisfy Phase 1 and Phase 2 goals for antibody production. For instance, eight 25,000 L reactors with a final titer of 100 mg/L would be sufficient to satisfy Phase 2 targets of 120 kg. Similarly, a process with 1000 mg/L in eight 2,500 L bioreactors, which may consist of disposable bioreactors, would satisfy Phase 2 production targets. Phase 3 targets, however, would require a process with 1000 mg/L and a plant configuration of eight 25,000 L bioreactors. One such plant configuration, Genentech's Vacaville II plant, is currently sitting idle and could provide sufficient capacity for bio-defense production [6]. Although not quite as large as the Vacaville II plant, there are additional large-scale antibody production plants sitting idle elsewhere in the US.",

Previous solutions for small-scale manufacturing are limited in both process reproducibility and product quality, owing to their complicated means of protein expression and purification. We describe an automated, benchtop, multiproduct manufacturing system, called Integrated Scalable Cyto-Technology (InSCyT), for the end-to-end production of hundreds to thousands of doses of clinical-quality protein biologics in about 3 d. Unlike previous systems, InSCyT includes fully integrated modules for sustained production, efficient purification without the use of affinity tags, and formulation to a final dosage form of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. We demonstrate that InSCyT can accelerate process development from sequence to purified drug in 12 weeks. We used integrated design to produce human growth hormone, interferon \u03b1-2b and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with highly similar processes on this system and show that their purity and potency are comparable to those of marketed reference products.",

            "text": "The future of global bioprocessing demands are flexible, scalable solutions for a rapidly changing landscape of the biopharmaceutical industry [5]. In addition, minimizing the impact on the environment in the face of climate change is the need of the hour and time. Two extreme production scenarios exist: on the one hand, fully disposable factories offer flexibility and enable high speed and rapid change of products. On the other hand, large stainless-steel plants have been designed for high capacity and economies of scale. Such plants are mainly dedicated to one product but solutions for a medium-scale production are also common. The small disposable factory presents the solution for production of preclinical or clinical material and for contract manufacturing where the product is often switched. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing has been already considered for fast production of smaller amounts of material but its real advantage is in the full-scale manufacturing offering a substantial reduction of costs and environmental impact potentially using the small flexible facility paradigm [6,7]. In addition, a continuous manufacturing unit can be controlled and automated [8]. \n\nIn view of the metric Process Mass Intensity (PMI, amount of material required for a defined amount of product, e.g., kg/kg) [9] adopted by the ACS green chemistry group conventional manufacturing of biologics is not efficient. PMI in antibody manufacturing is in the range of 7000 kg/kg product, whereas for small molecules the PMI is in the range of \u2248 300 kg/kg product. In the case of biologics, the PMI is driven by water consumption, with downstream processing being the main driver for high water and material consumption. Electricity used to power the cleanroom infrastructure are the major contributor to the environmental footprint. American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable has estimated 22.7 tons CO 2 eq per 1 kg bulk drug substance, e.g. antibody using single use technology at a 2000 L bioreactors scale [13] Water and energy reduction is the area where continuous downstream processing can make a major contribution due to better resources efficiency and reduction of floor space [10][11][12].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol. So far, no reports of industrial-scale continuous production of biopharmaceuticals using bacterial expression systems exist. The most-often-cited reasons for this are the genetic instabilities of the bacterial strains and recombinant plasmid leading to higher cell heterogeneity, the formation of inclusion bodies, and the increased acetate toxicity through overflow metabolism. Additionally, an increased metabolic burden which leads to lower growth rates and protein yield, and eventually increased cell death, as well as challenges of maintaining sterility, are also reported [10]. \n\nPrevious studies have focused on quantifying the metabolic load associated with recombinant protein production [11,12] and determining the growth and protein production kinetics to optimise operating conditions and devise control strategies for the bioreactor [9]. High throughput techniques, including miniaturisation and parallelisation of bioreactors are used in both industry and research. Cascade operation and multistage culture that decouples the growth from the protein production stage have been investigated with promising results, combined with adequate induction strategies for protein expression [13,14]. \n\nThe advances in continuous protein production using E. coli were recently summarised in [15], focusing on the knowledge transfer opportunities from fed-batch to continuous operation. One exciting development is using glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a substrate to make the RPP more sustainable [16][17][18]. Although there is an increased interest in the transition from fed-batch to continuous processing with E coli, the heterogeneity of the culture and the lack of stable production are considered obstacles [15,19]. Highthroughput single-cell expressions studies are required for understanding the dynamics and performance of heterogenous cell populations [20]. \n\nThis work uses a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, to test the recombinant protein expression in an E. coli strain with industrial relevance in glucose and glycerol-limited chemostats.",

In this review, we will focus on transient production strategies using plant viral expression systems, with a particular focus on the variety of proteins produced, and their applications. We will also discuss the latest developments in the downstream processing of plant materials for efficient extraction and purification of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Because of the absence of more sustainable alternatives in the past, the great usefulness of polyclonal secondary antibodies in basic research certainly justified their animal-based production. However, to guarantee their constant supply to an ever-growing market, the producing companies had to dramatically increase their livestock, aim for very high antibody titers using aggressive hyperimmunization strategies causing strong side effects, and increase the frequency and volume of collected bleedings. It is therefore not surprising that the industrial scale production of antibodies has led to severe animal welfare and ethical problems. The magnitude of these problems recently surfaced in the Santa Cruz Biotechnology scandal (Shen, 2013;Reardon, 2016).\n\nIdeally, one could replace all animal immunization by selecting binders from synthetic libraries (Gray et al., 2016;Moutel et al., 2016;McMahon et al., 2017;Zimmermann et al., 2017). Yet, with a purely synthetic approach, it is still not straightforward to obtain high-affinity binders. Further, the synthetic strategy is typically also inferior in terms of binder specificity, because it lacks the stringent selection against self-reactivity that happens in antigen-exposed animals. The requirement for specificity is particularly high for secondary antibodies. We therefore see the approach applied here of using an immune library for binder selection as the best possible compromise. Because it is generally sufficient to obtain a few good nanobodies out of a small blood sample containing \u223c100 million lymphocytes, and because we found methods to further improve the initial candidates in vitro, there was no need for any hyperimmunization aiming at high titers. Importantly, once ideal nanobodies are identified, they are defined by their sequence and can be renewably produced in E. coli at constant quality and without further animal involvement. Because polyclonal secondary antibody production accounts for the largest share of immunized animals in the world, the anti-IgG nanobodies described in this study have the potential to make a great step forward toward reducing animal use and further contribute to a future of standardized recombinant antibodies (Marx, 2013;Bradbury and Pl\u00fcckthun, 2015a,b).\n\nWe expect that our anti-IgG nanobodies will replace polyclonal secondary antibodies in many of their applications, for instance, in Western blotting and",

            "text": "Byuel et al. (2017) [39], the yields of recombinant protein obtained using VFU reached 2 g kg \u22121 (after optimization). Moreover, they state that the annual demand for 50 t of pure recombinant protein (e.g., monoclonal antibody) can be covered by 72 t y \u22121 of bulk mAb from 3.5-11.0 km 2 of open fields or 0.4-1.2 km 2 of VFU area. On the other hand, the same yields of production, but in a CHO-based system (Chinese hamster ovary cells), required a bioreactor volume of 250 000 L. A well-known example of the largest plant-based production system is the one established by Fraunhofer IME to 2G12 (Ab) output. This system allows approximately 900 L of bulk extract to be produced, processing 250 kg of tobacco leaf biomass [39].\n\nAt present, some research institutions have developed fermentation strategies (e.g., fed-batch, continuous fermentation) based on a plant system which is easy to scale up [42]. For a plant cell culture-based system, bioreactors for recombinant protein production on a large scale with 1000-25 000 L working volume are usually used [8]. As proven by numerous studies, plant cell systems are successfully used for producing therapeutic proteins on an industrial scale [40,41]. However, thus far only few examples of therapeutics produced in this way have been commercialized. The main limitation in terms of commercialization is the low protein yield (0.01-10 mg/L). A protein productivity of 10 mg/L was generally considered as the entry level for expanding the commercial process. But recent progress in plant genetic engineering allows the yields of recombinant proteins to be improved to a level of 100 mg/L (e.g., antibodies) or even up to 247 mg/L (e.g., 1-antitrypsin) in rice cell culture [42].\n\nA well-known example of a therapeutic protein produced on an industrial scale in carrot cell cultures (ProCellEx6) is the human recombinant -glucocerebrosidase (taliglu",

However, the maintenance of mammalian cells is rather expensive making it worthwhile to explore alternative production platforms for low-margin antibodies used as technical reagents (Frenzel et al., 2013). Yeast is less costly and has the capacity to perform post-translational modifications, but has mainly been employed for the production of antibody fragments, while only limited data concerning full-size IgG expression are available (Frenzel et al., 2013;Gasser et al., 2006). Plants on the other hand offer the necessary economy and scalability and have been used extensively for the production of antibodies, including complex full-size formats (Ma et al., 1995;Orzaez et al., 2009;Sack et al., 2015). While some antibodies are intended to function in the plant itself, for example to protect the plant against pathogens or to modulate signalling pathways (Safarnejad et al., 2011), most antibodies expressed in plants are destined to be purified in compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) for medical applications (Stoger et al., 2014). The scalability of plant-based expression systems has been successfully demonstrated by the development of automated production facilities for the rapid manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals in plants at industrial scales (Holtz et al., 2015;Wirz et al., 2012). A tobacco-derived antibody was approved by Cuban authorities in 2006 as an affinity purification reagent for a hepatitis B vaccine produced in yeast (Pujol et al., 2005). Although this antibody is not used as a pharmaceutical, it nevertheless had to meet GMP standards as part of the vaccine manufacturing process. Another tobacco-produced antibody that prevents dental caries (CaroRX) has received market approval as a medical device, and the experimental drug ZMapp, a combination of three humanized monoclonal antibodies that recognize an Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, was manufactured by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants by Kentucky BioProcessing under licence from Mapp Biopharmaceuticals Inc. San Diego, CA, USA (Qiu et al., 2014). A number of further plant-derived antibodies for pharmaceutical application have entered into clinical studies (",

Schematic representation of three different CHO cells expressing three different glycosylated IgGs. The mammalian cell line contains the necessary cellular components to produce properly folded and glycosylated IgGs.

Considering these factors, CHO cells or other mammalian cells may possibly be the best choice for large-scale production of recombinant antivenoms based on more complex antibody formats, such as IgG (Walsh, 2014;Wright and Morrison, 1997). In regards to cost of treatment, it has been suggested that using CHO cells for oligoclonal expression of mixtures of recombinant human IgGs could provide an entire treatment against a typical snakebite envenoming for as little as USD 30e350 (Laustsen et al., 2017(Laustsen et al., , 2016b.

Over the years, mAbs have gained significance as essential elements in various clinical diagnostic tests, and have been used in the treatment of diverse diseases including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infections [3], [4], [5]. \n\nWith its vital role in the pharmaceutical industry, the market size of mAbs is projected to reach an impressive $138.6 billion by 2024 [6]. However, the high annual cost of mAb treatments poses a significant challenge, as it can amount to approximately $35,000 per patient [2]. This cost is attributed to the required high doses and the expensive production process. Consequently, optimizing its production is imperative. \n\nThe majority of steps in mAb manufacturing rely on batch operations, such as batch/fed-batch culture and chromatography purification. Due to the increasing pressure to drive down cost, there is a growing interest in a transition towards a fully-continuous production process. This transition offers potential advantages, including enhanced product quality, quantity, and stability, as well as the elimination of expenses associated with storing intermediate products. In comparison, batch operations suffer from various drawbacks such as lower efficiency, higher costs, challenges in scaling up, and compromised product quality [7]. \n\nSeveral studies have explored the continuous manufacturing of mAbs [6], [8], [9]. The continuous production process can be divided into two main components: the upstream process and the downstream process. In the upstream process, a perfusion bioreactor is utilized to continuously supply nutrients for cell nourishment. In a study by Papathanasiou et al. [10], a GS-NS0 cell culture system was considered for mAb production within the bioreactor. To maintain a high cell density, a cell retention device is typically incorporated to recycle cells from the effluent stream of the bioreactor. The remaining contents are directed downstream for product purification through a number of chromatography steps. \n\nTo maintain continuous flow, the first step of the downstream process usually employs two or more chromatography columns.",

            "text": "The development of rAAV manufacturing has emerged as a critical component of advancing gene therapies, notably due to its reliability, safety, and ability to achieve long-term transgene expression. With several rAAV-based products already receiving FDA approval and around 250 clinical trials underway, the demand for scalable GMP-manufacturing processes for the production of a wide range of rAAV serotypes is greater than ever. \n\nHowever, manufacturing capacity can be identified as the main bottleneck because current manufacturing processes are outdated and lack scalability and productivity which results in substantial production expenses. This stresses the need for more efficient and scalable manufacturing processes. The biggest challenge in DSP remains to robustly remove excess of empty capsids in a scalable manner. For that, column chromatography presents a promising alternative, showcasing advantages in scalability, reduced costs, and possibility for monitoring, control, and automation. For AC, antibody-based ligands are most popular and have shown to bind a variety of serotypes. For polishing purposes, IEX and specifically AEX is most frequently used, as it facilitates the separation of empty from full viral capsids based on differences in the surface charge. Still, column chromatography faces the main challenge that there is a need for tailored optimization for different AAV serotypes for both capture and polishing chromatography methods. \n\nMoreover, the shift towards continuous bioprocessing presents a transformative opportunity for rAAV manufacturing, offering potential improvements in sustainability, efficiency, productivity, and reduced facility and manufacturing costs. The business case for rAAV continuous manufacturing is strong given by the high treatment costs of rAAV therapies. Nevertheless, developing continuous rAAV processes will require advanced upand downstream equipment and a high level of automation, monitoring, and control. A possible solution for continuous DS operations can be largely translated from the mAb process due to similar unit operations such as MCC. Finally, the integration of PATs is essential for enhancing the quality control landscape of continuous rAAV processing. By developing rapid and reliable analytical tools, streamlining the production process and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards becomes possible. This is supported by recent advancements in rAAV process analytics that show potential for being applied as PAT in continuous processes.",

            "title": "Functional Production of a Soluble and Secreted Single-Chain Antibody by a Bacterial Secretion System",
            "text": "Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) retain the original antigen-binding activity and possess several unique properties such as small size, easy engineering, good tumor penetration, rapid blood clearance, and low antigenicity [1][2][3]. Therefore, they have been widely used in industrial, medical diagnostic, and research and therapeutic applications [4][5][6]. Currently, there is a need to develop cost-effective approaches for the mass production of scFvs. When compared with other expression strategies, the bacterial expression system is the most economic strategy for the production of scFv antibodies [7,8]. However, the mass production of scFvs in the bacterial cytoplasm or periplasmic space often leads to protein misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation within inclusion bodies [9,10]. To circumvent these problems, Jurado et al. showed that if the culture temperature is reduced to 16uC, the ratio of the soluble fraction versus whole cell protein extracts of Trx-scFv B7 increased 6-fold, but Trx-scFv B7 in whole cell protein extracts also decreased by approximately 80% [11]. This indicates that lower growth temperature enhanced the solubility of scFv but reduced the total protein production. In addition, Hu et al. demonstrated that the proper folding of recombinant scFv was enhanced when domoic acid-binding scFv was co-expressed with the Escherichia coli chaperone DnaKJE. Although a 35% increase in the yield of the soluble fraction was achieved by this method, the production process in the bacteria was more complicated [12]. In contrast, protein purification from bacterial extracts has been associated with a high risk of contamination, posing additional challenges in acquiring highly pure proteins [13,14]. The secretion of scFvs into the LB medium would enhance the proper folding of recombinant scFvs, prevent protein contamination, and simplify the protein purification process to potentially allow large-scale cost-effective production of scFvs.",

            "text": "The use of E. coli culture may be more economical, but it remains limited to simple, non-glycosylated proteins, and often requires additional downstream processing steps to ensure proper protein folding and endotoxin-free product. Recently, production of recombinant biologics in plants has received considerable attention because the platform provides specific advantages over traditional microbial and animal cell cultures. Plants possess an exceptional biosynthetic capacity for expression of recombinant proteins without supporting growth of adventitious agents (e.g., prions, pathogenic viruses) harmful to patients. It is now routine for plant cells to be used in the production of complex proteins, such as IgA, IgG and IgM [3][4][5] or virus-like particles. 6,7 The first plant-made therapeutic drug for human use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012, 8 and over 16 plant-manufactured proteins in phase I, II, and III clinical trials are in progress. 9 he first transgenic plant expressing a recombinant therapeutic protein was described over 25 years ago 10 and was soon followed by the development of a transient expression system applied at laboratory-scale, 11 and subsequently at field-scale for production amplification. 12,13 Higher expression levels were subsequently obtained using viral-based transient expression vectors combined with Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. 14 The new vectors facilitated the successful expression of a broader range of proteins in plants, and enabled an increase in drug development programs using plant-based technologies. These expression vectors such as magnICON \u00d215 and iBioLaunch TM16 created the opportunity for transient expression in plants to be adapted to contained, large-scale biomanufacturing facilities with quick development time, high flexibility and easy scale-up. 17 Since the bioreactor unit is a single plant, protein production can be scaled up in a linear fashion by simply growing more plants and increasing the number of plants in a batch. Traditional stirred-tank bioreactors for mammalian-cell biotherapeutic manufacturing require incremental scale-up from research scale to production scale. Each step must demonstrate comparability and incorporates many variable factors such as mixing mass transfer, heat transfer, and hydrodynamic shear.",

            "text": "The production of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and other biologics is performed primarily in batch mode. This results in larger equipment, cleaning/sterilization volumes, and dead times compared to any continuous approach. Consequently, production throughput is lower and capital costs are relatively high. Switching to continuous production thus reduces the production footprint and also lowers the cost of goods (COG). During process development, from the provision of clinical trial samples to the production plant, different plant sizes are usually required, operating at different operating parameters. To speed up this step, it would be optimal if only one plant with the same equipment and piping could be used for all sizes. In this study, an efficient solution to this old challenge in biologics manufacturing is demonstrated, namely the qualification and validation of a plant setup for clinical trial doses of about 1000 doses and a production scale-up of about 10 million doses. Using the current example of the Comirnaty BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the cost-intensive in vitro transcription was first optimized in batch so that a yield of 12 g/L mRNA was achieved, and then successfully transferred to continuous production in the segmented plug flow reactor with subsequent purification using ultra- and diafiltration, which enables the recycling of costly reactants. To realize automated process control as well as real-time product release, the use of appropriate process analytical technology is essential. This will also be used to efficiently capture the product slug so that no product loss occurs and contamination from the fill-up phase is <1%. Further work will focus on real-time release testing during a continuous operating campaign under autonomous operational control. Such efforts will enable direct industrialization in collaboration with appropriate industry partners, their regulatory affairs, and quality assurance. A production scale-operation could be directly supported and managed by data-driven decisions.",

            "text": "Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are glycoproteins, which specifically recognise foreign molecules. These recognised foreign molecules are called antigens. When antigens invade humans or animals, an immunological response is triggered which involves the production of antibodies by B-lymphocytes. By this immunological response, microorganisms, larger parasites, viruses and bacterial toxins can be rendered harmless. The unique ability of antibodies to specifically recognise and bind with high affinity to virtually any type of antigen, made them interesting molecules for medical and scientific research. \n\nIn 1975 K\u00f6hler and Milstein developed the monoclonal antibody technology [1] by immortalising mouse cell lines that secreted only one single type of antibody with unique antigen specificity, called monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). With this technology, isolation and production of mAbs against protein, carbohydrate, nucleic acids and hapten antigens was achieved. The technology resulted in a rapid development of the use of antibodies in diagnos-tics (e.g. pregnancy tests; [2]), human therapeutics and as fundamental research tools. \n\nMore applications outside research and medicine can be considered, such as consumer applications. Examples are the use of antibodies in shampoos to prevent the formation of dandruff [3] or in toothpaste to protect against tooth decay caused by caries [4]. For these purposes large quantities of antibodies are required. However, for these applications on a larger scale there were some major problems concerning the expensive production system based on mammalian expression, the difficulty of producing antibodies in bulk amounts and the low stability and solubility of some antibodies under specific (harsh) conditions. \n\nIn this review we will discuss the possibilities of largescale production of antibodies and fragments thereof by relevant expression systems. Requirements are that the system used for production is cheap, accessible for genetic modifications, easily scaled up for greater demands and safe for use in consumer applications. \n\nFirst, structure and characteristics of antibodies and antibody fragments generated thereof will be discussed, followed by the impact of recombinant DNA technology and antibody engineering techniques on the generation and modification of antibodies and antibody fragments. The modification of antibodies is of major interest since changes in their functionality and physico-chemical properties will broaden their application area.",

            "text": "To date, many vaccine antigens, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as the ZMapp\u2122 antibody against Ebola virus (Qiu et al., 2014), and other biopharmaceuticals have been produced in plants (Fischer and Buyel, 2020). Significant progress has been made to overcome the bottlenecks, i.e., in the yields of upstream production and downstream processing to gain a sufficient quantity of purified proteins and regulatory issues of plant-made recombinant proteins (particularly vaccines in this case), as well as using good manufacturing practice (GMP). Preclinical and clinical studies of a large number of plant-made human and animal recombinant pharmaceutical proteins are encouraging and have demonstrated the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of plant factories for vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and therapeutic protein production (Chan et al., 2016;Clarke et al., 2017;Fischer and Buyel, 2020). \n\nExperimental challenge models represent an essential tool to study disease development in fish. The experimental models are designed to mimic authentic infections in a controlled environment and are typically performed by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the pathogen, or cohabitation of na\u00efve fish together with shedder fish, or by immersion. The i.p. route of infection does, however, to a lesser degree mimic the natural route of infection compared to challenge by cohabitation and immersion. The models should therefore be validated with respect to representing real-life conditions for the infectious pathogen. \n\nWe report in the current study the production in N. benthamiana of a VLP-forming PMCV antigen and its performance in a fish immunization and subsequent challenge trial. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PMCV antigen produced in plants and tested in immunization trials, and that may contribute to the development of a CMS vaccine. Green plants could have potential as an antigen production platform for fish vaccines.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals have become an integral part of modern medicine since the production of insulin using recombinant DNA technology in 1978 [1]. Since then various recombinant protein therapeutics have been industrially produced to treat conditions ranging from cancer to infertility. These approved products include monoclonal antibodies, hormones, clotting factors, enzymes, vaccines and nucleic acid-based products [2]. While a high product titer is desirable, product quality such as correct folding and posttranslational modifications that are compatible with humans, is of key importance. This leads to very specific requirements that the production host needs to fulfill. The production of biologically active forms of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using CHO cells in 1987 marked the beginning of the CHO-based therapeutics era [3]. Due to their adaptability, the robustness of CHO cells also enables growth and protein production in a variety of culture conditions. The continuous increase in demand for biopharmaceuticals has been noticed over the past, with estimated total sales of $140 billion in 2013 [4] and $188 billion in 2017 [2]. Today, over 70% of recombinant biopharmaceuticals are produced in CHO cell factories [5]. Monoclonal antibodies, 84% of which are produced in CHO expression systems, have been reported to dominate the biopharmaceutical market [2,5]. \n\nWhile these cell lines are considered the preferred cell factory for the production of biotherapeutics, the instability of transgene expression during scale up and manufacture presents significant challenges to the biopharmaceutical industry in the context of reliable yields and regulatory approval for the product of interest. \n\nConventional strategies based on 'random transgene integration' have been considered to be one of the causes for instability and potential product heterogeneity [6,7]. This is primarily due to the impact of the genomic profile on the integration site. Over the years, many studies investigated factors associated with transgene integration and subsequent perturbation in molecular mechanisms that in turn may disturb protein production.",

            "text": "Large numbers of Escherichia coli or yeast recombinant proteins were initially employed in the first solid-phase protein arrays. The large-scale production of recombinant proteins requires significant time and effort, and the production process itself can introduce various problems that later influence the performance of these proteins in immunoassays. For these studies, large numbers of protein-coding sequences are cloned in appropriate expression vectors and then expressed in bacteria or yeast. These recombinant proteins are then isolated from lysate using affinity tags such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), which can be purified on glutathione-affinity supports. Owing to the fact that recombinant protein extracts contain variable amounts of E. coli or other contaminants after purification, the serum samples to be tested must be preincubated with bacterial or yeast lysates to block nonspecific binding. Additional blocking agents are typically needed to decrease the background and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Owing to the toxicity of the expressed proteins and insolubility issues, recombinant proteins generated in bacteria or yeast often show variable expression and low yields. This can result in marked differences in antigen coating efficiency, which can yield false negatives and/or miss detecting some antigens. \n\nProtein arrays are highly useful for identifying antigen targets in an unbiased fashion from complex proteomes. In one study, large-scale pathogen antibody profiling involved generating 882 recombinant These different proteins were produced with a GST tag and directly immobilized onto glutathione-coated microtiter plates. From ELISA testing, approximately 100 T. pallidum proteins were targets of antibodies from T. pallidum-infected rabbits. In a follow-up study using sera from syphilis-infected patients, 900 different T. pallidum antigens were arrayed on microtiter plates and used for antibody profiling [2]. A total of 34 additional proteins were found to be antigenic in infected patients and these antibody responses varied between primary, secondary and latent syphilis infection. One of the identified proteins, TP0136, was further studied and later found to be a protective antigen in experimentally infected rabbits [3].",

            "text": "In contrast, recombinant proteins produced in whole plants have to be extracted from the plant material, requiring the elimination of large quantities of insoluble debris and soluble plant host cell proteins during downstream processing (Figure 3A). Even when recombinant proteins are secreted by plant cell suspension cultures, the medium also contains several secreted host cell proteins that complicate product purification (Figure 3B). \n\nTo determine the manufacturing costs for a plant-based process, we produced the human full-size antibody M12 (Kirchhoff et al., 2012) in tobacco plants and purified the recombinant protein from the plant matrix. We grew 1,440 transgenic, homozygous T 4 Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1 plants in the greenhouse, and the pre-purification antibody yield was 400 \u03bcg/g fresh leaf tissue (Figure 4). The presence of a KDEL signal peptide on the C-terminus of the heavy chain caused the recombinant antibody to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. We harvested 200 kg of leaf material 8 weeks after sowing, and total soluble proteins were extracted using a custom-designed large-scale processing unit. To remove insoluble debris, the plant extract was passed over a sequential filtration cascade consisting of an initial bag filtration followed by three depth filtration steps with exclusion sizes of 8, 1, and 0.3 \u03bcm, respectively. Additionally, the clarified plant extract was passed through a 0.2-\u03bcm filter module before filling into disposable bags used for storage to avoid bacterial contamination. The M12 antibody was purified from the clarified plant extract using four process steps, i.e., Protein A chromatography, CaptoAdhere chromatography, ultrafiltration, and final diafiltration. The purity of the antibody in the final eluate was estimated to be >90%. The eluate from the final filtration step contained 0.5-5.0 units/ml of endotoxin and some residual Protein A (5-20 ng/mg IgG). The total yield of the purified product was 77 g, corresponding to a rather high recovery of 88% (Figure 4).",

In addition, in response to the emergence of new viral outbreaks, efforts are being made to improve the versatility and responsiveness of biologics manufacturing. 1,2 Transient gene expression (TGE) technology stands out as an attractive strategy that may help approach these questions. Using TGE, production titers can reach the range of g/L in a time span of weeks, 3,4 eliminating the high time-demanding tasks of clonal selection and characterization required for stable gene expression (SGE). 5 ][8] Nevertheless, SGE is still the leading methodology at industrial-scale biomanufacturing in most animal cell-based bioprocesses, while TGE is usually employed in R&D and preclinical stages. 9 However, some commercial bioprocesses still require TGE at both lab and industrial scale, such as the production of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). 10,11 spite the benefits of TGE, large-scale processes cannot be successfully scaled-up since a major drawback restricts production at high cell densities (HCDs), known as the cell density effect (CDE). 12,13 his phenomenon is regarded as a reduction in cell-specific productivity when cultures are transfected at densities above their mid-exponential phase. 14,15 1][22][23][24][25][26] Understanding the physiological causes of the CDE and allowing successful transfection at higher densities would increase the commercial exploitation of many TGE-based biologics, as their large-scale production processes are currently unfeasible. Higher titers would also contribute to a reduction of manufacturing costs, counteracting the cost of large amounts of GMP-grade plasmid required for TGE. 7 revious research on the CDE showed that it can be explained as a combination of two independent factors. First, an unknown extracellular inhibitory compound. \n\nIncorporating continuous medium replacement (MR) steps has been reported to improve transfection efficiency by removing conditioned spent medium, which is hypothesized to eliminate potential inhibitors. 21,22",

            "text": "The development of recombinant insulin and its production in Escherichia coli in the 1980s [1] launched an industry that comprises billion dollar markets, with products ranging from protein biologics ($91B) [2] to industrial enzymes ($4.8B) [3,4]. In recent years, the chemical and structural diversity of protein products has expanded rapidly, with targets such as short anti-microbial peptides [5], antibody-like binding proteins for diagnostics [6], and protein biomaterials [7,8]. These vast differences in physicochemical properties call for a variety of strategies to ensure that production of heterologous proteins is robust and scalable. \n\nSecreting protein to the extracellular space increases initial purity and thus can decrease the complexity of downstream processing. Eukaryotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or HEK 293 cells secrete recombinant proteins through their native secretion machinery at high titers [9][10][11][12]. Mammalian cells, however, are slow growing, expensive to culture, have large batch to batch variations, and can be difficult to genetically engineer [10,13]. Yeasts typically are faster growing but can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation [14]. \n\nBacterial hosts offer fast growth, relative genetic simplicity, and genetic stability [15]. Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans allow protein secretion directly to the extracellular medium through the general secretory pathway, as they lack an outer membrane (OM). Secretion stress response systems and folding chaperones provide extracellular quality control. B. subtilis has a high secretion capacity-titers on the order of grams per liter have been achieved [16][17][18]. Compatibility with heterologous proteins is largely limited to enzymes, however, and extracellular proteolytic degradation is a significant product quality issue [19]. S. lividans has low extracellular protease activity while retaining a high secretion capacity.",

In recent years, the development of deconstructed virus-based vectors has allowed plants to become a viable platform for recombinant protein production, with advantages in versatility, speed, cost, scalability, and safety over the current production paradigms. In this paper, we review the recent progress in the methodology of agroinfiltration, a solution to overcome the challenge of transgene delivery into plant cells for large-scale manufacturing of recombinant proteins. General gene delivery methodologies in plants are first summarized, followed by extensive discussion on the application and scalability of each agroinfiltration method. New development of a spray-based agroinfiltration and its application on field-grown plants is highlighted. The discussion of agroinfiltration vectors focuses on their applications for producing complex and heteromultimeric proteins and is updated with the development of bridge vectors. Progress on agroinfiltration in Nicotiana and non-Nicotiana plant hosts is subsequently showcased in context of their applications for producing high-value human biologics and low-cost and high-volume industrial enzymes. These new advancements in agroinfiltration greatly enhance the robustness and scalability of transgene delivery in plants, facilitating the adoption of plant transient expression systems for manufacturing recombinant proteins with a broad range of applications.",

This is particularly the case for gene therapy to treat hereditary and acquired diseases, as well as for vaccines as prophylaxis. In fact, the latter are a growth engine for the biopharmaceutical industry, motivated by the continuous increase of infectious hazards, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines are typically administered to healthy individuals and are, accordingly, subject to high safety requirements, which have to be considered in the manufacturing process. Biological nanoplexes are generally derived from living organisms and are more complex than traditional therapeutics in terms of their components and production technologies. This is equally true for vaccines based on encapsulated nucleic acids or recombinant proteins, which usually are structurally less complicated. Cell-based production processes for biological nanoplexes and recombinant proteins comprise three main segments: i) The upstream process (USP), in which the target components are manufactured, ii) the downstream process (DSP), where the components, produced in the USP, are purified in accordance with the regulatory requirements, and finally iii) the formulation and sterile filling of the formulated drug into appropriate primary packaging material. Scientists from different fields, including virology and bioprocess engineering, continue to improve manufacturing processes to shorten their development timelines, and to meet the global demand on vaccines. These developments cannot compromise on product quality and purity, and should ideally drive the cost-effectiveness of the process. In order to meet these challenges, scientists focus on the following bioprocess and analytical Research Topic: i) Inprocess accelerated analytics (Lothert et al., 2022), ii) process automation and data science (Vormittag et al., 2020), and high-throughput technology to speed up process development (Marchel et al., 2019; Hillebrandt et al., 2021), iii) process translation from the development scale to the production scale, iv) platform technologies in the area of USP (Felberbaum, 2015; Farzaneh et al., 2017; Chambers et al., 2018; Tan et al",

            "text": "Moreover, recovery and dilution of this dense fraction may trigger further LLPS, which is undesirable in any final formulation. Here, we show that addition of an excipient, such as Arg\u2022Glu, to the isolated dense fraction improves the properties of model high-concentration formulations generated from the dense fraction. As previously observed with other protein solutions, 35,36 Arg\u2022Glu reduced the viscosity of the model formulation (Figure 4), although further reductions in viscosity may be required to ensure syringeability as a final formulation. Importantly, Arg\u2022Glu also prevented further LLPS of the model formulation (Figure 3). Furthermore, the high concentration antibody solutions generated here by LLPS were not inherently unstable when stored under typical refrigerated conditions, with Arg\u2022Glu reducing both aggregation and fragmentation of the model formulations stored at 40\u00b0C to a level typical for other mAb formulations. 27,37 ue to its spontaneous and self-driven nature, it may be tempting to incorporate LLPS in bioprocessing pipelines as a means of concentrating biopharmaceutical mAbs. To achieve that conditions under which LLPS occurs must first be identified for each individual mAb. While the primary sequence of some mAbs may render them inherently more prone to self-association and LLPS, 25,38 a wide variety of additives, such as salts, macromolecular crowders and polyvalent ions, [39][40][41] can be used alongside temperature and pH to induce LLPS. Selection of these additives and conditions could be achieved using conventional highthroughput screening platforms, for example, through detection of opalescence by light scattering techniques. To recover the favorable properties of solutions concentrated by LLPS, conventional formulation screening 42,43 could be used to establish which excipients should be added to the separated dense fraction to prevent further phase separation, reduce self-association and solution viscosity, and achieve long-term storage stability. The practical issues regarding the scalability of this approach to the larger volumes necessary during industrial-scale bioprocessing require further investigation, and most likely would be mAb-and process-dependent.",

            "text": "In general, it is my hope that the pandemic will usher in a renaissance of biologics manufacturing technologies to the general benefit of all medicines made thereafter. \n\nModerna's ability to complete GMP of their RNA vaccine in 43 days was a powerful demonstration of the advantages of genetic delivery platforms. Traditional antibody manufacturing routinely can take 18 months. Even during a pandemic, manufacturing is likely to be one of the central bottlenecks in bringing antibody therapeutics to market against the novel coronavirus. Being able to deliver RNA or DNA and having the patient act as their own bioreactor avoids a substantial amount of time and complexity involved in traditional protein drug development. Compared with protein mAb products, RNA and DNA may have advantages with respect to manufacturing and delivery. The challenge is in generating a high enough titer in vivo to provide protection. A proof of concept published by Moderna 21 included RNA-delivered Chikungunya antibodies that achieved doses approaching 20 \u03bcg mL -1 , suggesting that this could be a viable means of delivering anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. G.G.: In response to the urgent need for COVID therapeutics, pre-IND studies of COVID-19 therapeutic mAbs have been accelerated by perhaps threefold or more relative to what had been typical for antibody therapeutics. Manufacturing has to rely on established and fully de-risked technologies -namely, expression in CHO cells. Cell-line development, which is typically relatively lengthy, can also be completed much faster than typically done, although at a commercial risk. The fact that the therapeutic dose will be of the order of a gram or more of mAb (based on extrapolation from what has been reported for NHP challenge models) means that almost surely administration will have to be intravenous. The high dosing may pose additional challenges for formulation and release testing. G.S.: Over the past 20 years, the productivity of mAb manufacture has undergone dramatic improvements in yields/ productivity and in the worldwide industry convergence in manufacturing engineering and process technology. Today, there are approximately 25 global facilities with very large scale (VLS) stainless steel fermenters. All of these facilities are readily adaptable to the manufacture of any recombinant antibody and are individually capable of manufacturing up to 10 tons of antibodies every year.",

The tools cannot only be used for creating new \"super-drugs\" but also to make well-known treatments more available.\n\nProducing hemoglobin recombinantly in yeast has proven feasible. The challenges which still remain are considered solvable with the combined forces of knowledge, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. This review has described some of the possible strategies to further improve yeast-based cell factories.\n\nCurrently, commercial production of recombinant hemoglobin is too expensive, to match the price of bloodderived hemoglobin. The cost should be further decreased by three-fold, but once strains have been optimized and large production plants have been established, hemoglobin can be produced at large scale. Yeasts are easy to cultivate and require cheap substrates in order to produce hemoglobin. It is also important to note that recombinant hemoglobin is not associated with the same risks as blood-derived hemoglobin in terms of pathogens and unstable supply.\n\nAll in all, the production of recombinant hemoglobin can ensure access to safe and affordable blood substitutes for the entire world population. Ultimately, the production of recombinant hemoglobin via synthetic biology will decrease inequality and help reach the goals set by WHO.",

Techniques like local production in low-resource settings contribute to eliminating reliance on costly imports and addressing barriers to vaccine accessibility [206].

Recombinant vaccines have emerged as a cost-effective solution, utilizing microbial fermentation systems to produce antigens efficiently and affordably [207]. Alongside this, feed-based vaccine formulations further reduce costs by eliminating the need for labor-intensive delivery methods such as injections, streamlining both production and administration processes [208]. \n\nSustainable vaccine development considers minimal environmental impact in conjunction with aquaculture practice that reduces the use of antibiotics. Advances in the stabilization of vaccine formulations have reduced cold-chain dependency, which decreases energy-intensive logistics and increases shelf-life stability [206]. Furthermore, environmentally friendly adjuvants and biodegradable delivery systems, are in development to reduce waste and ecological contamination [207]. However, challenges persist in assuring these sustainable practices at economically viable scales, especially among small-scale aquaculture operations.",

            "text": "Passive immunization (PI) with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) purified from animal serum was first adopted to treat diphtheria in the 19th century (Graham and Ambrosino, 2015). Antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies have progressively substituted antisera-based therapies. However, pAbs-based antivenoms remain the only available treatment against complex toxin mixtures such as those present in snake venoms. The global venom burden has been estimated at 2.5 million envenomings and 125 000 deaths per year (Chippaux, 1998). Despite steady improvements (Gutierrez, 2014b;Gutierrez et al., 2011), antivenom-based snakebite treatments are not free of side effects as a consequence of the exposure to heterologous antibody constant regions. Furthermore, antivenom supply is at constant risk due to high manufacturing costs and the low income level of target populations (Arnold, 2016;Harrison et al., 2009). Antivenoms made of recombinant human or humanized antibody cocktails would be a highly desirable alternative as they would reduce the adverse effects while facilitating product standardization and reproducibility. Unfortunately, manufacturing costs for complex antibody cocktails are still high because to ensure consistency they often require parallel production lines for each component of the cocktail. Conversely, simplifying the cocktail composition may compromise its efficacy due to the high diversity of toxins comprising venoms. Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile moves towards cocktail simplification with a major trend in antivenom formulation, namely to widen the spectrum of snake venoms covered by a single treatment (Lavonas, 2012;Stock et al., 2007). \n\nTo overcome these limitations, we have developed a synthetic biology strategy for antivenom production based on the expression of recombinant pAbs in plants. Plant biofactories provide affordable alternative platforms for recombinant antibody production (usually known as 'plantibodies') (Stoger et al., 2002) due to their scalability, high production yields, the low risk of contamination with adventitious pathogens and lower requirements for production facility building (Paul and Ma, 2011;Paul et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The CFPS system is a versatile in vitro platform for biosynthesis and functional studies. 1 Compared to in vivo production by hosts, CFPS provides a time-and labor-effective alternative for recombinant protein production. 2 In addition, CFPS has been employed for a variety of applications such as high-throughput screening, 3\u22125 transcription-translation system research, 6,7 and the production of complex proteins that are traditionally challenging to synthesize in vivo. 1,8 CFPS is particularly advantageous for expressing antimicrobial peptides, 9,10 membrane proteins, 11,12 and toxic proteins. 13,14 lthough CFPS provides substantial benefits, achieving high yields often requires optimization, particularly for challenging proteins such as those with high molecular weight (MW), 15 disulfide bonds, 2,16,17 or structurally associated membrane domains. 1,12,18 In particular, many strategies, such as the genetic modification of host cells to enhance the biosynthesis activity of cellular extracts, 15,19 the supplementation of energy sources, 20 the use of crowding agents, 20 or the use of mild surfactants, 21 are all viable options for enhanced CFPS productivity. Numerous reports detail the large-scale production of proteins by CFPS methods, overcoming challenges associated with in vivo expression. 18,19,22,23 he adaptability and tunability of CFPS present considerable opportunities for investigating the expression domains of novel and intricate biomacromolecules. 24 This is particularly relevant for the synthesis of spider silk biomaterials, which are notoriously difficult to produce by using traditional methods. \u221228 This subsequently results in a typically poor yield and quality of recombinant spidroins during scaled production. Therefore, CFPS may provide an excellent alternative, bypassing the in vivo cellular obstacles and offering an innovative biosynthesis platform to replicate the intricate native processing of spidroins. This can be advantageous for creating an efficient system for the production of bioengineered spidroins. \n\nHowever, there is currently limited research exploring the feasibility of producing silk or fibrous-associated proteins via  CFPS, and few studies focus on relevant biomolecules with tandem repeats 29,30 and codon-biased preferences. 31,32",

            "text": "Since biopharmaceuticals are highly prone to denaturation and degradation events, as well as to modifications in their amino acid and sugar patterns, the manufacturing conditions must be strictly controlled (Kesik-Brodacka, 2018;Lin et al., 2021). As such, welldesigned stabilization systems/excipients for these biomolecules are required to guarantee their long-term stability and preservation. Notwithstanding their outstanding properties, the IP protection and the regulatory approval pathways for biopharmaceuticals are more complex due to their manufacturing processes, since the characterization of the target drug and the evaluation of the reproducibility and safety of the production approach are mandatory (Tavares et al., 2019). Moreover, biopharmaceuticals are more expensive to produce (average production cost per pack was ca. U.S. $60 for biopharmaceuticals, in contrast with U.S. $5 per pack of small-molecule drugs) (Makurvet, 2021). A representative overview of the biomanufacturing of mAbs, including all steps required in the upstream and downstream stages, is provided in Figure 3. The upstream processing starts with the cell culture in optimal conditions designed to assure the proper cell growth in the culture media (Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018). This process is then scaled up through a sequence of various bioreactor stages; the obtained cell mass is then transferred to the final bioreactor to allow the expression and production of the target biomolecule (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes, 2010;Hong et al., 2018). Afterwards, cells and cell debris are separated from the culture broth by a sequence of cell harvesting steps, involving centrifugation and/or filtration approaches, to obtain a clarified broth (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes, 2010;Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018).",

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), polyclonal antibodies, recombinant antibodies, and antibody fragments all have their niche uses, requiring different purification techniques. The current capabilities of antibody production by recombinant techniques has increased the need for purification on a larger scale (up to 100 kg batches), 1 thus requiring innovative purification methodologies. To achieve current industry standards for antibody purification, affinity chromatographic bioaffinity ligands are commonly used. ][4] Purification can alternatively be achieved through the use of genetically fused purification tags, the most common of which is a polyhistidine tag (poly-His or His 6 ) that is utilized in immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The production of a poly-His tag exerts a low metabolic burden on the producing host; however, it is not as specific as affinity chromatography. 5 on-exchange chromatography using a multicolumn countercurrent solvent gradient purification (MCSGP) system has been described as an alternative to Protein A-based chromatography. 6 This system recycles partially purified fractions, therefore increasing the protein yield, and by using a simulation model and experimental setup, it was shown that ion-exchange MCSGP can achieve industrial levels of antibody yield with high purity. \n\nTo achieve lower cost and more efficient antibody purification on an industrial scale, alternative purification methods have been developed, including refinement and advancements in traditionally used methods. The production of antibodies can be divided into up-and downstream processes. This review will focus on recent innovative advances in the downstream purification of antibodies by addressing both chromatographic and nonchromatographic methods, whereby the production of active antibodies free from harmful biological or chemical contaminants is paramount.",

Unique manufacturing challenges arise due to patient-specific requirements, input material variability, processrelated features, and short shelf-life, amongst other factors. The production of autologous cell therapies, for example, in both a centralized and distributed manufacturing model makes use of a more complex digital information flow than that presented in Figure 1. \n\nThe network of facilities involved in the production and distribution of biologic therapies, as well as flow of information (data, raw materials and finished products) between them is shown in Figure 2, which maps both traditional biopharmaceutical and advanced (e.g., ATMP) manufacturing. Production of increasingly personalized therapies using advanced manufacturing models leads to more complex exchange of information and materials that may make these activities more susceptible to interruptions. Clinics serve as the starting point for collecting cells through apheresis and endpoint for infusion of the final product. In between, patient-specific input materials are transported to a centralized or separate manufacturing units, each with a complex set of cyber-physical systems that maintain process control. Information exchange across the network (e.g., patient, clinic, manufacturing site(s), supply chain) demonstrates the added physical and digital complexity for manufacturing these emerging therapies, thus increasing vulnerability to cyberattacks.",

The rescue strategy can \"save\" the reduced mAb batches without sacrificing the manufacturing process flexibility or increasing the manufacturing cost. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the approach of developing the rescue strategy in manufacturing process has been reported. 8,16,[18][19][20][21] As a post-translational modification, a disulfide bond is formed by reoxidizing two neighboring free cysteine residues.- [22][23][24] Though there is a vast body of knowledge of in-vitro disulfide reoxidation for antibodies, the majority of these studies focused on the solution environment with limited investigational conditions. 8,18,19,25,26 The existing studies cannot be directly and practically implemented in manufacturing process for three reasons. First, the reaction parameters were not optimized under typical manufacturing operation conditions to achieve high intact purity and fast reoxidation kinetics. Second, there is limited information on whether any downstream unit operation (such as Protein A chromatography, ion exchange chromatograph, and ultrafiltration/diafiltration) can be selected to implement the rescue strategies. Also, the manufacturability of using the rescue strategies at a large scale remains to be seen. Third, there is a lack of comprehensive characterizations to confirm the product comparability between the rescued mAb and the reference material. Thus, to develop practical industrial rescue strategies, the gap between the existing disulfide bond formation studies and the general mAb manufacturing process must be bridged.\n\nIn this series of studies, we systematically evaluated how to implement the reduced mAb rescue strategy into the mAb manufacturing process to bridge the aforementioned gap. Our studies are discussed in two papers: 1) the \"proof-ofconcept\" study evaluated the possibilities of rescuing reduced mAb, selected the unit operation step (Protein A chromatography) to include the rescue strategy and developed the kinetics models to optimize reaction parameters under typical manufacturing operation conditions; and 2) the \"developability and manufacturability\" study implemented a potential rescue strategy during Protein A chromatography and performed comprehensive characterizations of the recovered mAb, showing the capabilities of generating high-",

This is problematic because many of these biomolecules often lose stability (denatures by losing its quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structure) once introduced into a foreign (non-native) environment. Membrane-bound proteins in particular have been widely exploited as druggable targets 5 but are difficult to study as solubilized targets due to protein conformation changes in the absence of a stabilizing lipid or cell wall environment. Similarly, synthetic recombinant antibodies produced in eukaryotic or prokaryotic production systems commonly lose stability, especially when they originated in a display library. Many strategies have been developed to overcome these stability issues. Particularly promising are cell envelope compositions to stabilize proteins and recombinant antibodies in native or native-like environments.\n\nRecombinant antibody fragments are a promising class of protein capture reagents which are poised to complement or replace complete, full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in immunosensors. 2\u22124 These fragments can show identical specificity toward target antigens as their parent, full-length mAbs. They also have the added flexibility to engineer the fragment antigen binding site, which allows custom production of reagents with the most sought after affinity traits. Furthermore, antibody fragments can be rapidly isolated from libraries of antibody fragment genes using various display technologies. They are renewable and can be produced in eukaryotic or prokaryotic production systems followed by scaleup manufacture to reduce production costs. 6,7 More recently we developed an antibody library biopanning method that utilized whole cells during selections. This ensures the recombinant membrane-bound proteins maintain their native conformation during antibody selections. 8 One of the most common types of antibody fragments are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which are recombinant polypeptides that are composed of a light-chain variable (V L ) domain connected by a flexible hydrophilic",

            "text": "Allogeneic based products are amenable to a scale-up-based manufacturing approach, suitable for an \"off-the-shelf\" or \"ondemand\" product. The manufacturing system for these products can be viewed as a \"push\" system, wherein both information and process goods flow in the same direction. These products are produced in large quantities, stored, released, and shipped as needed. Manufacturing strategies for this approach can borrow extensively from similar strategies used in biologics and the medical device industry involving the production of biopharmaceutical therapeutics such as viruses, antibodies, and other recombinant proteins. As shown in Figure 1, cells are obtained from tissue biopsies of individual donors, stored in master cell banks, expanded to form working cell banks, and then expanded to production level large quantities. Unlike with production of biopharmaceuticals, cells are living products and are carried forward through every processing stage. Challenges involve actively monitoring cellular yields and maintaining the product's critical quality parameters such as purity, potency, and viability during the large-scale production run. Products that involve the use of scaffolds (required in musculoskeletal and other whole organ replacement) will involve an additional layer of complexity because of the need to maintain its own quality attributes prior to seeding them with the therapeutic cell product. Such complex therapeutic products will require conditioning, real-time monitoring, and noninvasive release testing procedures before delivery to the patient. \n\nAutologous based products are patient-specific because of the need for immunologic compatibility. These products are suitable for a scaled-out approach, wherein ideally a facility accommodates the parallel production of multiple, separate, and automated closed systems from multiple patients. Production is generally seen as a \"pull\" system, wherein customer requirements drive the processing cycles, and hence information flows in the opposite direction to product flow. Cells from individual donors are obtained, expanded, and processed to meet clinical specifications and then finally delivered back to the same patient. Economies of scale can only be obtained by using the same infrastructure repeatedly while still maintaining distinct, parallel product flows with nearzero chances of cross-contamination. Systems used at each processing stage should be automated, closed, and tracked in real time and often involve single-use disposable equipment.",

            "text": "With the advent of unnatural molecules that pose increasing industrial problems as these have unpredictable manufacturability, the protein therapeutics industry must constantly innovate. Many bioprocess optimization strategies have been explored to increase the volumetric productivity while maintaining low operational complexity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have benefited most from these continuous efforts to meet increasing market demand and reduce manufacturing costs [1,2]. The preferential mammalian system of expression of biopharmaceuticals are the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) for their ability to perform post-translational modifications close to human, its efficient protein folding and its delivery of high productivity [3][4][5]. Over the last 2 decades, expression of mAbs in CHO has been greatly improved and volumetric titers of 10 g/L in 14-18 days can now be achieved [6][7][8][9]. These titers are associated with the most dominant production method for mAbs, the fed-batch mode [8][9][10][11].\n\nFed-batch mode is a simple production mode in which a basal medium is supplemented with feed solutions containing nutrients to support the production phase. It is well recognized for its high mAb yields, its reliability, ease of execution and implementation at the industrial scale [9]. In addition, multiple parameters such as basal and feed media components, feeding strategy, temperature, pH or process duration can be optimized to maximize cell culture longevity and increase productivity. Nevertheless, due to the increasing 1 3 demand for improved efficiency, alternative fed-batch modes have emerged. Most of them are qualified as fed-batch process intensification strategies due to the achievement of high seeding densities. A recent concept consists in pre-stage perfusion (N-1) which allows for robust accumulation of biomass by cell retention for higher seeding density of bioreactors (N) [12][13][14]. It results in shorten production timelines by reducing process duration or can lead to higher final harvest titer in smaller bioreactors. Interestingly, this hybrid operational mode moderately impacts facility design, as it is based on pre-existing processes rather than implementing completely new technologies. Saving time, space and money are additional gains to enhanced productivity.\n\nDespite these great",

The class of mAb products has many unique and valuable features derived from industrialized bioprocess technologies, which in themselves can become key factors in a unified and fully integrated drug development strategy.\n\nIn this case, the objectives of process development groups would shift from a focus on invention and innovation for new technologies to optimization and maturation of current production technology. The maturation phase should allow for continued refinement and improvements in manufacturing technology and COGs reductions, but will be more evolutionary than revolutionary. This may reflect a natural progression for process technologies driven by the introduction of new classes of products. In one theory of the link between product and process innovation, process innovation lags behind product innovation, but eventually peaks and declines as the product class becomes a well-established market. 23 The decreasing rate or need for process innovation could reflect maturing production technology, maximization of returns on the capital sunk into existing facilities, diminishing returns of new technology, and other factors.\n\nThis situation would allow companies to avoid risky process development designs that could have challenges in scale-up, technology transfer or reliance on a single raw material suppler. Novel production technology should be carefully evaluated, and implemented only if it is clearly enabling and concrete drivers are identified. Novelty for novelty's sake is no reason to stray from an acceptable processing platform that enables portability among the many facilities that share a common design basis, and offers attractive economies of scale. A focus on controlling product quality and process consistency at all production scales and facilities would trump minor improvements in titer improvements or COGs reduction. Development objectives should shift to a focus on understanding the process fundamentals of the current platform. There are many areas of research relevant to bioprocess technologies associated with antibody expression and purification that should continue to drive investment in areas of cell biology, biochemical engineering, protein chemistry and stability. Even today's state-ofthe-art processes offer ample opportunities to make cell line development even more predictable through control of certain critical quality attributes, such as stability and levels of mAb expression, minimization of sequence variants, 24 etc. For production cultures, modeling and manipulation of cellular metabolism to control accumulation of waste products such as lactate, understanding recent observations of disulfide bond reduction in high-titer mAb processes, and refining scale-down process models would all be valuable areas of research.

The HeLa\u2010based stable cell line rAAV production system provides a robust and scalable alternative to transient transfection systems.

A safe clinical profile, availability of viral serotypes with different tissue tropisms, and potential long-term gene expression are main advantages of rAAV as viral vector. To date, more than 100 gene therapy clinical trials have been conducted, tackling a variety of diseases such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilic disorders (Carter 2005;Bryant et al. 2013; Gene therapy clinical trials website: http://www.abedia.com/wiley/). Production of rAAV vectors started approximately 32 years ago, after different groups demonstrated formation of genetically modified AAV viral particles capable of infecting and transducing mammalian cells (Tratschin et al. 1984;Hermonat and Muczycska 1984). From a clinical perspective, these findings raised the possibility for developing a new type of therapeutic DNA vector. From a biotechnology and bioprocessing perspective, this new biologic represented a unique market opportunity, assuming that biotech manufacturing capabilities could meet quantity and quality requirements. Subsequently, significant effort has been put toward the design of simple and efficient processes for rAAV production.\n\nThree expression systems are currently used for industrial vector production: adenovirus (AdV), herpesvirus (HSV), and baculovirus (BV) complementation systems. Despite promising advances, there are several challenges associated with the manufacturing process. Complementation systems bring inherent complexity to the production process because rAAV formation requires an intricate interplay between virus and host genetic elements. This phenomenon has a direct effect on process robustness and understanding, as subtle variations on the number of biological or chemical inputs used in upstream bioprocessing can affect productivity. This problem is clearly seen in transfection-based protocols, where lot-to-lot yield can vary drastically based on the number and concentration of plasmids used, amount of transfection agent used, cell viability, and mode of operation (Wright 2009;Huang et al. 2013;van der Loo and Wright 2016). Another concern during vector production refers to the generation of product-related impurities. Some components used during cell culture readily copurify with rA",

            "text": "Plants offer a number of attractions over traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing for the pro-duction of simple and complex therapeutic proteins. After development of a transformed cell line, production of recombinant protein in the range of 5-20 g in mammalian cell culture systems requires about 3 months (Morrow, 2002). Scale-up from this level of protein production requires considerably more time and large capital investments. In many cases, it will cost significantly less to grow plants with the ability to mass-produce therapeutic/pharmaceutically-important proteins because plant-based expression systems are not likely to be associated with the same level of capital investment. Plant-based production schemes can also be more easily expanded or contracted to provide quantities of product reflective of demand. Depending on generation time, one or more harvesting of the transgenic plants producing the target recombinant protein(s) can be achieved within a single growing season. Moreover, plants and their seeds are a renewable resource that can be quickly scaled up to meet needs. Cline (2003), Director of Government and Industry Affairs at Monsanto Protein Technologies, estimated that an animal cell culture manufacturing facility designed to produce 500 kg of MAb per year of the type (a single product facility) currently used by the pharmaceutical industry would require up to $450 million dollars in capital and would take 4-7 years to build and approve. In contrast, the same product could be grown on 500 acres of corn, purified in a facility costing $80 million and requiring three to five years to build and approve. Cost per gram of MAbs by traditional means is $350-$1200 per gram (depending on scale). Corn would cost $80-$250 per gram (depending on scale). Similarly, it has been suggested that gram quantities of recombinant antibodies can be produced from tobacco cell cultures or transgenic plant leaf material in 3-4 months with scale-up to kilograms in less than 2 years (Hood et al., 2002). Among the other production benefits are simplified downstream processing compared to traditional production technology, the ability of transgenic plants to accommodate a wide range of protein types, including some not possible by traditional production technology, and enhanced safety.",

            "text": "Antivenom production involves the repeated immunization (for months to years) of large mammals (mostly horses and sheep), followed by purification of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from the hyper-immunized plasma. IgG purification is typically carried out by salting-out procedures using either caprylic acid or ammonium sulfate [9,14,[17][18][19]. Additionally, most manufacturers produce F(ab') 2 antivenoms by introducing a pepsin digestion step [20]. As a result, antivenoms consist of a mixture of both toxin-neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against all other antigens that the immunized animal has come across throughout its life, resulting in a low titer of therapeutically relevant antibodies [21,22]. CroFab [23], an antivenom purified by affinity chromatography using snake venom coupled to a matrix, is the only exception. However, affinity purification greatly increases production costs. Moreover, the toxicity of some venoms largely depends on poorly immunogenic low molecular mass toxins. This discrepancy between toxicity and immunogenicity generates an unbalanced antibody content in antivenoms, with a major fraction of the antibodies targeting immunogenic, but non-toxic, high molecular mass components, and a minor fraction of the antibodies targeting highly toxic, but poorly immunogenic components [24][25][26][27][28]. \n\nIn order to reduce the public health burden caused by bites or stings of venomous animals, current biotechnological tools have been applied to improve antivenom production (reviewed in [29][30][31]). One useful approach has focused on antivenom production independent of venom use. Here, several modern immunization techniques have been explored, such as the utilization of synthetic peptide epitopes, recombinant toxins (or toxoids), consensus toxins, and DNA strings. Apart from leaving aside venom use and, consequently, the need to keep venomous animals in captivity, antivenom production based on new immunization approaches is considered quite feasible, since it can readily be adapted to current manufacturing platforms without introducing significant modifications.",

Transgenic expression delivers the advantages of mammalian cells such as a sophisticated refolding machinery and glycosylation. Other features of trans-genic productions are scale-up flexibility since herd \u017d . size can be increased or decreased rapidly and inexpensively, as well as the relative low-cost and low complexity of the raw product manufacturing \u017d . facilities farms as compared to more traditional GMP cell culture facilities. \n\nFurther work is underway to fully evaluate the applicability of transgenically produced antibodies to therapeutic needs, in particular, studies of the functionality and pharmacokinetics of the milk-derived recombinant antibodies. It is expected that glycosylation structure of caprine mammary gland-derived antibodies will not be identical to CHO cell-derived material. However, there is very little evidence suggesting that differences in glycosylation resulting from expression in different mammalian host cells significantly influence the behavior of recombinant \u017d . antibodies Bebbington, 1995 . In all cases, where it was examined, antigen binding of milk-expressed antibodies was found to be similar to equivalent mammalian cell culture derived molecules.",

In market, other eukaryotic systems are also available but E. coli and yeast are used for recombinant proteins. The current preferred systems includes Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) (Wurm, 2004) and baculovirus-infected insecticide cells (Berger, Fitzgerald, & Richmond, 2004), but plant antibodies have increased in number and types. Plants play key role in recombinant protein which is made by mammalian cells, because in mammalian cell the downstream processes create problems.

            "text": "Interestingly, while cancer remains a universal concern, the staggering high production cost of recombinant blocking antibodies is expected to impact in lowand middle-income countries. \n\nThe use of plant expression systems to produce pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceuticals is constantly expanding and gaining recognition in the research (Bulaon et al., 2020;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Rattanapisit et al., 2021;Shanmugaraj et al., 2021) and manufacturing industries (Nosaki et al., 2021). Some of its key advantages include rapid and ease of cultivation, scalability, lack or low risk of pathogen contamination, ability to carry out posttranslational modifications and cost-effectiveness (Nandi et al., 2016;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Nosaki et al., 2021). For several years, mammalian cell cultures (i.e., CHO cells) have been the dominant expression system for mAbs. Nonetheless, the plantbased facility is projected to lower operating expenses and cost of goods sold compared to the CHO facility (Kelley, 2009;Petrides et al., 2014;Nandi et al., 2016). The downstream processing costs for a mAb produced using a conventional CHO cell platform at a high production capacity (1,000 kg/year) were estimated to be $232/ g. Even at a much lower production capacity (600 kg/year), the plant-derived platform has a cost of goods sold of \u223c$99/g, which includes both upstream and downstream process operations, corresponding to decrease of over 50% in manufacturing costs. According to the presented techno-economic model (Nandi et al., 2016), plant-based expression technology is a promising platform for the production of mAbs. Our team (Rattanapisit et al., 2019;Phakham et al., 2021;Yiemchavee et al., 2021;Phetphoung et al., 2022) have previously expressed recombinant immunotherapeutic antigens and antibodies in plants, providing proof of principle for its viability.",

Future trials will test the efficacy of prophylaxis in humans [70]. \n\nThe complex and glycosylated structure of 2G12 means that it must be produced in eukaryotic expression platforms and then tested in specific assays to confirm its in vitro antigen-binding and neutralization capacity. The molecule was initially produced in hybridoma clones, generated by the electrofusion of B-cells and CB-F7 myeloma cells, producing 10 pg of the antibody per cell per day [60]. The mRNA for the 2G12 heavy and light chains was isolated and transcribed into cDNA in 1998 [71]. Large-scale antibody production was then achieved in CHO cells and the antibody was purified by protein A affinity chromatography. For most in vivo studies and clinical trials, 2G12 IgG1 was manufactured by Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH (Vienna, Austria) under cGMP guidelines, at a cost of C350-500/mg. Uniquely, the 2G12 prepared for clinical trial NCT01403792 was manufactured in tobacco leaves using a novel cGMP process. \n\nHIV microbicides must be effective, safe, user-friendly, and above all economically affordable in the developing world, which has the highest number of HIV patients. Plants are ideal for the production of such low-margin/highdemand antibodies because of the economy of scale offered by agricultural production. This concept was developed in the EU project Pharma-Planta, which achieved the expression of 2G12 in several plant species and the fast-track development of transgenic tobacco as the primary production platform. The use of many different plants showed that the species, tissue, and subcellular compartment could affect the structure and composition of the antibody glycans, but this had no significant impact on the HIV-neutralization capacity of the antibody in vitro [72].",

            "text": "Development of the hybridoma technology by K\u00f6hler and Milstein (1975) has revolutionized the immunological field by enabling routine use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in research and development efforts, resulting in their successful application in the clinic today. While recombinant good manufacturing practices production technologies are required to produce clinical grade mAbs, academic laboratories and biotechnology companies still rely on the original hybridoma lines to stably and effortlessly produce high antibody yields at a modest price. In our own work, we were confronted with a major issue when using hybridoma-derived mAbs: there was no control over the antibody format that was produced, a flexibility that recombinant production does allow. We set out to remove this hurdle by genetically engineering antibodies directly in the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus of hybridoma cells. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and homology-directed repair (HDR) to modify antibody\u2019s format [mAb or antigen-binding fragment (Fab\u2019)] and isotype. This protocol describes a straightforward approach, with little hands-on time, leading to stable cell lines secreting high levels of engineered antibodies. Parental hybridoma cells are maintained in culture, transfected with a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the site of interest in the Ig locus and an HDR template to knock in the desired insert and an antibiotic resistance gene. By applying antibiotic pressure, resistant clones are expanded and characterized at the genetic and protein level for their ability to produce modified mAbs instead of the parental protein. Finally, the modified antibody is characterized in functional assays. To demonstrate the versatility of our strategy, we illustrate this protocol with examples where we have (i) exchanged the constant heavy region of the antibody, creating chimeric mAb of a novel isotype, (ii) truncated the antibody to create an antigenic peptide-fused Fab\u2019 fragment to produce a dendritic cell\u2013targeted vaccine, and (iii) modified both the constant heavy (CH)1 domain of the heavy chain (HC) and the constant kappa (C\u03ba) light chain (LC) to introduce site-selective modification tags for further derivatization of the purified protein.

            "text": "The global market for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies is currently ~$50 billion a year, and the biopharmaceutical industry has many powerful novel mAbs in the clinical pipeline. However, for many indications a mAb alone is insufficient to achieve a significant and durable response. Therefore, several companies have initiated clinical trials utilizing biclonal and triclonal combinations of antibodies for diseases against which mAb therapy has been ineffective. ][4] Preclinical studies suggest that three or more antibodies are often necessary to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect. Increasing the complexity and diversity of the antibody combination can improve the therapeutic benefit by many different mechanisms of action. Effective treatment may require blockade or modulation of multiple pathways, e.g., as in the case of infection with a bacterium such as Staphylococcus aureus expressing numerous virulence factors, 5 or development of autoimmune disorders 6 or cancer, 1 where redundant pathways promote pathology. ][9][10] Indeed, a recent preclinical study comparing mono-, tri-, and penta-therapy with broadly neutralizing antibodies to different HIV epitopes in a humanized mouse model found that only the five antibody mix could prevent escape mutants and control viremia for the entire course of treatment. 11 bbreviations: AAV, adeno-associated virus; ACT, antibody combination therapeutic; cGMP, current good manufacturing practices; CIEX, cation exchange; CMC, chemistry, manufacturing and control; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ITR, inverted terminal repeat; p5IEE, p5 integration efficiency element antibody combination therapeutics (aCTs) are polyvalent biopharmaceuticals that are uniquely suited for the control of complex diseases, including antibiotic resistant infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders and cancers. However, aCTs also represent a distinct manufacturing challenge because the independent manufacture and subsequent mixing of monoclonal antibodies quickly becomes cost prohibitive as more complex mixtures are envisioned. We have developed a virus-free recombinant protein expression platform based on adeno-associated viral (aaV) elements that is capable of rapid and consistent production of complex antibody mixtures in a single batch format.",

Commercial scale production of recombinant antibodies from plants will also benefit from the food and beverage industrial technologies (Larrick et al., 2001). There are major hurdles of purification of antibodies from plants, which can be sorted out easily. A major concern of phenolics, which alter the properties of protein dramatically and irreversibly, can be removed by ultrafiltration or diafiltration. Other concerns include secondary metabolites, endotoxins and mycotoxins, which can be minimized by rapid processing and early filtration (Larrick et al., 2001). The removal of these constituents is an important aspect for progressing towards the clinical trials of plantibodies, which is really not a major hurdle as several antibodies have been purified to homogeneity for human clinical use.",

The establishment of robust manufacturing platforms are key for antibody drug discovery efforts to seamlessly translate into clinical and commercial successes. Several drivers are influencing the design of mAb manufacturing processes. The advent of biosimilars is driving a desire to achieve lower cost of goods and globalize biologics manufacturing. High titers are now routinely achieved for mAbs in mammalian cell culture. These drivers have resulted in significant evolution in process platform approaches. Additionally, several new trends in bioprocessing have arisen in keeping with these needs. These include the consideration of alternative expression systems, continuous biomanufacturing and non\u2010chromatographic separation formats. This paper discusses these drivers in the context of the kinds of changes they are driving in mAb production processes.",

            "text": "For controlled expression of recombinant proteins in P. tricornutum an inducible system based on the nitrate reductase promoter/terminator was recently established with protein expression being easily controlled via NH 4 + /NO 3 2 supplements in the media [25]. Antibody expression was performed under inducible conditions to find best induction periods and circumvent potential growth defects due to over-expression. Best induction period turned out to be 1-2 days. After that time point antibody expression levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, constant antibody expression by providing nitrate from the very beginning resulted in a high expression level similar to rates after 1-2 days (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates in addition that antibody accumulation does not impair growth rate and cell viability -a quite important attribute if large scale production is intended. \n\nQuantification analyses demonstrated that antibody concentration lies at about 8.7% of total soluble protein on average. In absolute data this complies with approximately 400 mg antibody in a 250 ml culture, which needs about one week to reach adequate cell density. Antibody production in P. tricornutum was tested over 13 month with no decrease in antibody expression levels, thus antibody production seems to be stable for long terms. In general, P. tricornutum transfection has proven to be stable and because antibody expression is controlled by an inducible systemallowing non-induced stock preservation -there should be no problem with long-term stability of the production strains. \n\nAntibody purification was carried out with protein A-Sepharose beads in small scale. Purification was very efficient with no contamination products or degradation products detected by Coomassie or Silver Staining (Fig. 2D). Further analyses revealed that both antibody chains get glycosylated in P. tricornutum as demonstrated by Western Blot analyses and incubation with lectins or subsequent oxidation with sodium-periodate, respectively (Fig. 2D). \n\nFunctionality of a-HBsAg antibodies produced in P. tricornutum was tested by ELISA. Wells were coated with Hepatitis B virus surface antigen and incubated with serially diluted purified antibody or whole protein extract of an antibody expressing clone, respectively.",

            "text": "Allogeneic stem cell therapies will potentially be able to treat a broad range of unmet medical needs ranging from dry eye related macular degeneration to acute myocardial infarction. They are particularly promising for treating large patient numbers as they are obtained from a universal donor and are thus more suited to manufacturing at large scale. To date, commercialized allogeneic stem cell therapies include Prochymal (Osiris, Columbia, MD) for graft-versus-host disease, approved in Canada and New Zealand, and Cartistem (Medipost, Seoul, Korea) for osteoarthritis, approved in South Korea. However, several products have faced challenges achieving scalable, robust, and cost-effective manufacturing processes (Brandenberger et al., 2011;Griffith and Naughton, 2002;Kirouac and Zandstra, 2008;Ratcliffe et al., 2011;Rowley et al., 2012). This has contributed to several notable failures due to manufacturing concerns such as high cost of goods (COG), high process variability, and loss of efficacy upon scale-up (Brandenberger et al., 2011). Hence the commercial feasibility of cell therapies is underpinned by the need to solve the manufacturing challenges posed by large-scale production. This article investigates the technical innovation required in cell expansion technologies for cell therapy products to realize their commercial potential and achieve the manufacturing success of biopharmaceuticals. \n\nBiopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have benefited from the availability of large-scale bioprocessing technologies and the associated economies of scale (e.g., Birch and Racher, 2006;Farid, 2006;Kelley, 2007). However, this is not currently the case for allogeneic cell therapy manufacture due to its relative infancy as well as the inherent complexities of manufacturing living cells as the final product. In contrast to mAbs, only a limited number of cases of xeno-free cell culture media for cell therapy products have been reported (Lindroos et al., 2009;Rajala et al., 2010). Additionally, the culture can also include feeder cells to promote growth.",

            "text": "The manufacturing of biotechnology products is a complex logistical process that connects multiple unit operations and often leads to lengthy in-process hold times or bulk drug substance storage. Identification of appropriate storage conditions and optimized buffer systems for biopharmaceutical proteins is essential in ensuring the stability of these products and therefore maintaining the purity, potency, safety, and efficacy of these drug substances throughout the manufacturing process. A typical purification scheme for monoclonal antibodies involves Protein A affinity chromatography followed by polishing chromatography and filtration steps, with an end product of concentrated antibody in a mild acid to neutral pH solution, prior to drug substance formulation. Selection of a suitable buffer system that mitigates physical and chemical degredation of monoclonal antibodies, especially one that minimizes aggregate and particle formation is an important consideration for efficient downstream fill-finish operations and long-term stability [1]. Parameters that are typically studied include solution pH, buffering system, inclusion of saccharides, tonicity agents, detergents, and other excipients [2,3]. \n\nRegulatory guidance stipulates that antibodies intended for human subjects are tested both at lot release and in stability studies [4] for a variety of product attributes, including opalescence and degradation products such as aggregates, particles, or precipitate formation. These undesirable degradation products may be associated with immune responses [5] and in extreme cases can lead to loss of significant monomer content or protein insolubility, impacting potency, and efficacy to the point where it is unacceptable to use in humans. \n\nIn this study we use a monoclonal antibody cell culture system that was developed by hybridoma technology and has been used by several academic groups to evaluate different 2 BioMed Research International aspects of manufacturing from cell culture to formulated bulk drug substance [6][7][8][9][10]. This model murine IgG3, while not a humanized antibody suitable for clinical use, has no proprietary entanglements and can be successfully used as a model for bioreactor produced monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "Indeed, the need for dedicated production processes and facilities for each vaccine created using conventional technologies keeps validation and manufacturing costs high [1]. Furthermore, the average development of a conventional vaccine from the preclinical phase requires >10 years and has a market entry probability of 6%. The long lead time and hundreds of potentially complex steps required for manufacturing highlight the urgent need for new approaches to expedite vaccine development. \n\nEstablished methods used to identify and produce new vaccine candidates are no longer sufficient to ensure global protection against emerging, often ill-defined pathogens; a shift in methodology is needed. Manufacturers desperately require new technologies able to spur rapid vaccine development and large scale production, reduce the cost, shorten the time to licensure, and to allow responding quickly to pandemic threats [1]. Viral vector and nucleic acid-based vaccine platforms created during the past few decades promise to provide solutions to these vaccine challenges [1,5]. Viral vector vaccines are comprised of nonreplicating or attenuated, replicating recombinant viruses that encode one or more target antigens. Presentation of these antigens in combination with stimuli inherent in the vector mimic a natural infection that induces strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity. A potential disadvantage of viral vector vaccines is pre-existing immunity to the vector, such as a recombinant adenovirus, which commonly causes human infection.",

            "text": "There is a lot of effort directed at the use of plants as model host species during recombinant protein production. Depending on the type of protein being produced and the production scale, the choice of a host plant is one of the most important considerations during the development of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants. The choice of a host is governed by factors such as the size of the product as well as post-translational modifications. Similarly, the transformation method chosen plays an equally central role during the recombinant protein production process. While attention has been placed on the upstream processing of plants during the early stages of recombinant protein production, more attention and research need to be directed at downstream processing. Different recombinant proteins require different extraction and purification processes, emphasizing the need for more extensive research in the recovery and purification of the proteins. The use of recombinant protein extraction and purification strategies such as blanching [92], sucrose density gradient centrifugation [86], and one-step Ni 2+ affinity chromatography [93] has been used successfully during the downstream processing of plant-produced vaccine candidates. Despite current challenges and obstacles, the production of vaccine candidates in transgenic plants appears to be getting more pervasive. \n\nExisting plant expression platforms afford a lot of benefits beyond the conventional advantages of high scalability, low cost, eukaryotic protein modification, and enhanced safety. Inimitable transient expression vectors have been generated to enable the expression of therapeutics and vaccines at an unprecedented pace to combat probable pandemics and bioterrorism threats. Plant-derived biologics comprise the fastest and largest growing category of pharmaceutical products. Presently, a majority of human biopharmaceuticals are generated in microbial and mammalian cell cultures. These require facilities that are capital-intensive in addition to the necessity of fermenters, costly downstream processing, cold temperature requirements for storage, and transport as well as sterile delivery schemes [108]. On the other hand, plant-based production platforms dispense with the need for bioreactors, expensive cell culture media, and capital-restrictive facilities while being easily scaled up in comparatively inexpensive greenhouses with facile mineral solutions. Therefore, plant-derived expression systems afford the innate advantage of reduced manufacturing costs.",

To achieve optimal clinical efficacy, the successful COVID-19 mAbs will also need to demonstrate optimal efficiency in manufacturing. This will include the productivity of the cell line, highly efficient upstream and downstream processes and drug product formulations that are stable as liquid solutions at high antibody concentrations. Antibodies that are effective as monotherapies, have extended treatment duration and that are effective at lower clinical dosages could be highly advantaged. \n\nVir selected its lead mAb (VIR-7831) both with strategic consideration of these clinical characteristics and with the intention that projected manufacturing constraints would not impact our ability to treat the world's patients, if successful.",

            "text": "Advancements in material science have led to the development of new composites and biomaterials. Spider silk and human collagen are examples of animal-derived polymers for which sourcing has been challenging. Interest in strong, sustainable products derived from these biopolymers and increasing demand in bio-based solutions are driving forces for investments in non-animal-based production processes namely for use in biomedical applications. An outline of the current landscape of microbial-based bioprocesses is a useful tool to guide further development of novel biomaterials based on these proteins. While bioproduction can deliver a sustainable source for human collagen and for spider silk, it has been challenging to obtain the desired products via microbial-based bio-industrial processes. Optimization through improvements in upstream processes and better adapted large-scale downstream process steps, including replacing chromatography steps with freeze drying and autoclaving for endotoxin removal (silk) and filtration (collagen) has enabled large-scale production and recent capacity expansion of manufacturing, aiming to deliver hundreds of tonnes of product per year. This article reviews the considerable advances that were made in microbial processes for production of human collagen and spider-silk based biomaterials in the past 30 years in translating the laboratory results into scalable processes. Main challenges for successful large-scale implementation\u2014such as recombinant silk durability and the continuous need to improve process economics\u2014and main opportunities such as demand growth of recombinant spider silk and human collagen are outlined.",

Therefore, it remains challenging to treat patients in short time frames, especially in remote locations with limited infrastructure. To overcome these barriers, we developed a platform using genetically engineered Pichia pastoris strains designed to secrete multiple proteins on programmable cues in an integrated, benchtop, millilitre-scale microfluidic device. We use this platform for rapid and switchable production of two biologics from a single yeast strain as specified by the operator. Our results demonstrate selectable and near-single-dose production of these biologics in <24\u2009h with limited infrastructure requirements. We envision that combining this system with analytical, purification and polishing technologies could lead to a small-scale, portable and fully integrated personal biomanufacturing platform that could advance disease treatment at point-of-care. Current biopharmaceutical manufacturing platforms use single biologic-producing cell lines cultured at large scales. Here the authors develop a small-scale, portable biomanufacturing platform to produce single dose IFNa2b and rHGH from a single engineered strain of P. pastoris.",

            "text": "Large-scale production of recombinant proteins that maintain immunological activity comparable (or better) to the native parasite protein is another challenge for recombinant vaccine development. Therefore, correct folding and post-translational modification (i.e., glycosylation) will depend upon the protein production host used (prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic). Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli is a popular approach, however, production of insoluble antigens (e.g., O. ostertagi rASP1) and unsuccessful application of such proteins in vaccination trials (e.g., OPA and H-gal-GP) have been observed Cachat et al., 2010;Matthews et al., 2016). In some cases production of antigens as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein (MBP) and glutathione-Stransferase (GST) in E. coli have resulted in excellent protection during vaccination trials, as exemplified by T. solium antigens, TSOL16 and TSOL45-1A (in QuilA adjuvant) (Gauci et al., 2012). However, these results might be due to ancillary factors aside from the chosen recombinant antigen that may contribute to the observed protection conferred by native preparations. Moreover, recombinant antigen quality (such as protein solubility, folding and glycosylation) produced by protein production hosts may influence the host immune response (e.g., isoform, specificity and avidity of antibodies produced) (Matthews et al., 2016). To mitigate such outcomes recombinant protein production can be attempted in parasite-derived cells or a closely related species (e.g., C. elegans and bacculovirus-insect cell expression systems) in order to produce a protein mimicking the native molecule (Nisbet and Huntley, 2006;Roberts et al., 2013;Hussein et al., 2015;Van Oers et al., 2015). However, for some antigens like H. contortus antigen H11, protein recombinantly produced in C. elegans was unsuccessful when applied in experimental va",

Rituxan is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb against the human CD20 antigen, which is uniquely expressed on B cell surface. Previous studies found that Rituxan acts through several mechanisms contributing to tumor clearance. This includes complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the direct induction of programmed cell death, which together can effectively reduce the circulating B-cell counts in patients with lymphoma 2,3 . \n\nThe clinical success of Rituxan has significantly increased the market demand and generated huge profits, making Rituxan one of the top 10 best-selling antibody drugs with over $7.5 billion annual sale worldwide in 2014. Rituxan therapies require generally high doses, leading to high demand in Rituxan manufacturing capacity 4 . Rituxan is currently produced via mammalian cell culture, which is high cost and thus limits its mass production capacity 5 . On the other hand, patient population that need anti-CD20 mAb treatment remains large. For example, in China the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma has increased sharply in recent years. However, the penetration rate of Rituxan is less than 10% in China owning to its high cost. Therefore, the development of new methods for enhanced mAb production capacity is highly demanded. \n\nOver the past decade, recombinant anti-CD20 mAbs have been successfully produced in silkworms and plant seeds, but neither of these hosts has enabled large-scale production that meets the market demand [6][7][8] .

            "text": "Cultured mammalian cell expression systems, particularly Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, are used to manufacture high-value biotherapeutic recombinant proteins (rPs) such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [1]. Although the ability of such cell manufacturing 'factories' to produce rP products has been advanced over the last two to three decades, there is still an interest in further optimising the yields that can be delivered for novel and difficult to express proteins and the quality/homogeneity of the protein product. Two key parameters determining the amount of recombinant protein an expression system generates are (i) the maximum viable cell concentration achieved and the length of time this is maintained (the integral of viable cell concentration or IVC) and (ii) the cell-specific productivity of the cell (qP, or the amount of recombinant protein a cell manufactures per unit time, usually expressed as pg/ cell/day). In this regard, improved growth medium and feeding strategies have resulted in dramatic increases in the maximum viable cell concentration and IVC achievable for mammalian cells in the bioreactor, and this has been associated with extended culture viability and enhanced recombinant protein yields [2]. Indeed, achieving high yields of recombinant protein of a clinically acceptable quality is dependent on a multiplicity of parameters, including the choice of the host expression system, the achieved viable cell mass [3,4], gene copy number [5], site-specific integration [6,7], the cellular processes responsible from gene to protein in the synthesis of the desired product [1,8], the bioreactor environment (e.g. nutrients and oxygen levels) [2,9], the authenticity and homogeneity of the product [10,11] and the yield and success of downstream processing [12,13].\n\nThere are now many reports suggesting that major cellular constraints upon recombinant protein production (rPP) can be post-transcriptional ( [14][15][16]). One such control point is mRNA translation, with many reports having now reported that global and specific mRNA translation is a key parameter influencing rPP yields [14][15][16].

            "text": "Therapeutic antibodies are the largest class of new drugs occupying half of the global top 10 therapeutics products sold in 2022 [1]. These therapeutic interventions have achieved significant efficacies with reduced side effects in a number of disease areas especially for cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders. There is a huge and growing demand for recombinant antibodies in biopharmaceutical research and development pipelines. Expediting antibody discovery processes and shortening the development cycle are critical in effectively bringing valuable antibody drug products to the needed patients in clinics. Since antibodies are therapeutic protein drugs that are produced by cultivated mammalian cells, the antibody protein production process is an essential step for biotherapeutics research and development, e.g., lead candidate identification and optimization, in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies, as well as clinical applications. Tremendous research efforts have been put into method development for robust transgene production over the decades. \n\nWhile the chromosomal-integrated stable cell line approach is routinely utilized for generating clinical-grade recombinant antibodies, transient gene expression technologies (TGE) with episomal plasmid transfection in mammalian cells have been widely used for the rapid production of research-grade antibodies in milligrams and grams quantities [2][3][4][5][6]. Without the need for gene recombination into the host genomes which usually takes weeks to be stabilized, transient transfection of target DNAs complexed with cationic lipids, cationic polymers, or calcium phosphate, enables a fast and efficient protein scale-up production for a large number of antibody candidates in days. Mammalian cell hosts employed by the TGE technologies ensure not only functional protein folding and assembly but also proper post-translational modifications. The predominant host cell line for TGE is human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, which are known to be easy to use, highly transfectable to plasmid DNAs, and adaptable to robust high cell density growth in serumfree suspension.",

            "text": "Several approaches have been developed to facilitate oral delivery of peptides and proteins (reviewed in [81,82]). These approaches have supported successful oral delivery of several peptides/proteins, including semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist) for treating type 2 diabetes [78,79,81], desmopressin (an analog of vasopressin) for treating diabetes insipidus [60,81], and linaclotide for treating irritable bowel syndrome and constipation [60]. \n\nWe describe the anti-fibrotic effects of an endostatin-derived fusion peptide produced in plants. Compared to the potentially difficult and costly prospect of manufacturing peptides by solid phase synthesis, recombinant expression in plants can provide a relatively inexpensive approach to producing high-quality material on a large scale. Although the manufacturing capacity and regulatory environment of recombinant protein production using microbial or animal cell expression systems are well established, they have several limitations, including impractically high costs or incomplete protein folding. In addition, animal cell systems require extensive lead time to develop production lines and rigorously clear potentially contaminating viruses. In contrast, transient expression systems in plants support rapid and inexpensive production of recombinant protein products. With the Launch approach we used to manufacture END55 in Nicotiana benthamiana, yields of purified protein can range from 200 to 1000 mg/kg of fresh plant biomass. A variety of recombinant protein targets, including molecules that require complex posttranslational modifications, have been produced in plants using this system. These targets include vaccine antigens, human biotherapeutic proteins, enzymes, monoclonal antibodies, and biologically active hormones. In addition, plants produce proteins and peptides that are appropriately folded without requiring the development of a refolding protocol. Such a protocol is often required for proteins expressed in bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies. Plant expression also produces the same range of co-translational and posttranslational modifications seen in other eukaryotic systems. In addition, plant expression of proteins and peptides is rapid and cost-effective.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibody (mAb) production in mammalian cells is a well-known technique for synthesising identical antibodies. These antibodies are proteins with significance in medical applications. In 2017, mAbs represented the 6 top-selling biopharmaceutical products and has an expected yearly sale of 130-200 billion US dollars in 2022 (Walsh, 2018;Grilo and Mantalaris, 2019). This has resulted in significant efforts to increase the synthesis of mAbs in bioreactors with mammalian cell cultures. Biopharmaceutical companies increasingly seek for novel protein production methods to accommodate for an increasing number of protein drug candidates that enter various phases of research. In today's competitive market, it is challenging to retain desirable quality attributes while shortening time to market, maintaining cost efficiency, and enabling manufacturing flexibility.\n\nHigh cell density and productivity at large scale are key factors to achieve high process yield. There exist multiple bioreactor designs to achieve a balance between cell growth and volumetric productivity (Blunt et al., 2018;Mitra and Murthy, 2022;Carvalho et al., 2017).\n\nStep-wise bolus injections of the feed solution to the production bioreactor is the most frequently applied method due to its simplicity (Maria, 2020). Recently, continuous bioreactor systems have received increasing attention due to its easy scaleup, waste minimization, and non-sterile cultivation (Blunt et al., 2018).\n\nMedium development for a bioreactor system consists of multiple parts including optimization of feeding strategies,\n\nCorresponding author: J.B. J\u00f8rgensen (E-mail: jbjo@dtu.dk). and production of both batch medium and feed concentrates. Thus, medium development with statistical design of experiments type methods require lots of time, effort, and cost (Wohlenberg et al., 2022;Luna and Mart\u00ednez, 2014;Rend\u00f3n-Castrill\u00f3n et al., 2021). Therefore, process models can lead to valuable insights and optimization of bioreactors without the need of performing expensive and time consuming experiments. As an example, mechanistic modeling and optimization has been applied for a U-loop reactor for single-cell protein production (Ritschel et al., 2019).\n\nMechanistic models are extensively implemented for bioreactor",

            "text": "Influenza vaccine manufacturing, still mainly relies on outdated processes using embryonated chicken eggs, and even cell culture-based processes leave room for improvement. In contrast, the field of protein production offers advanced technologies that considerably support cell line development and with that also approval by governmental authorities. Despite their benefits, scientific reports on the implementation of such state-of-the-art technologies for viral vaccines process development are rarely found. We present a novel workflow for automated single-cell cloning using a CellCelector, followed by clone screening in an ambr15 system. Our results demonstrate not only a successful technology transfer, but also present an animal-component-free process that could potentially meet GMP-standards with a high-yield cell clone, suitable to challenge yields obtained from existing cell lines. We anticipate that this approach possesses significant dissemination potential to enhance the broader field of viral vaccine process development and may ultimately enable faster and more efficacious manufacturing of next-generation vaccines. \n\nprocess development in cell culture-based influenza virus production. We generated monoclonal suspension MDCK cell cultures in a chemically defined medium using a Cell-Celector and analyzed their growth characteristics, aiming for doubling times between 20 and 30 h and a low accumulation of metabolic waste products [23]. Moreover, we screened selected cell clones for influenza virus production in an ambr15 system, and demonstrate that standard virus titration assays allow capturing significant differences among cell clones. For biological relevance, high yields of several influenza subtypes were obtained with the two top cell clones in batch mode. We show that virus production in selected cell clones can compete with or even outcompete other adherent or suspension cell lines for processes implemented at different scales (15 mL to 1 L) that were previously reported in literature. Although similar approaches are conventionally used in cell culture-based recombinant protein manufacturing, such a strategy has to our knowledge not yet been evaluated for viral vaccine production.",

            "text": "As the first FDA-approved mAb, Rituxan has offered an effective treatment against most B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders over the past 30 years. However, known limitations of Rituxan, especially its high manufacturing cost, prevented its wide implementation, particularly in developing countries. Several previous studies have been conducted, trying to address these issues, including producing recombinant anti-CD20 mAbs in silkworms and plant seeds, but none has substantially reduced the manufacturing cost and patient population that need anti-CD20 mAb treatment remains large. Transgenic animal species, such as rabbits, goats and cows, offer attractive strategy to produce pharmaceutical proteins in their milk and cows are potentially the most appropriate species for their higher milk production capacity compared to others 24 . In this study, high level of recombinant anti-CD20 mAb production was seen in milk of the transgenic cattle, reaching to 6.8 mg/mL. Our mAb shared similar basic structure and biological properties with Rituxan. Most importantly, our mAb exhibited greater ADCC effector function than that of Rituxan, which was most likely owing to the afucosylated feature of our mAb, the major difference between our mAb and Rituxan. Thus, our study offers a promising approach for a new generation of anti-CD20 mAb with higher productivity and lower manufacturing cost than Rituxan. \n\nTo obtain highly pure mAb for future use, a feasible procedure has been developed, which consisted of two chromatography steps. Success of protein A affinity chromatography relied on the specific binding between the mAb Fc region and Protein A at a low pH, resulting in >93% purity 25 . The anion-exchange chromatography was designed to further remove residual impurities. Through our procedure IgG can be purified to a final purity of 99.8% with a recovery rate of 75%. Assuming that the average concentration of mAbs in milk is 2.5 g/L and a cow can generally yield 8,000 L of milk per year, each cow could produce more than 15 kg of mAb based on 74% recovery after the purification.",

            "text": "The costs associated with antibody production and isolation can be a limiting factor in their use. Strategies to enhance and reduce the cost of antibody therapeutics is an ongoing research area. Since the mid-1970s, hybridomas have been the main technology used in mAb production. The most common cells used for recombinant mAb production are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [67,68]. Identification and engineering of high-Ab production cell lines have long been a challenge. CHO cells are known to produce antibodies at approximately 1 g/L after optimization [68,69]. Factors that play a role in the success and efficiency of cell lines include the time until desired cell density is reached, the duration of production time allowing for antibody harvesting, and the overall titer of antibody produced [67]. Itoh et al. found that suppression of apoptosis-associated genes allows for longer culture times and therefore higher Ab titers [70]. The overproduction of proteins involved in protein folding, such as CHOP, have also shown improvement in the viability of antibodies produced [71]. Sittner et al. developed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to produce Abs more effectively against LcrV, a T3SS needle tip protein. This technique is intended to be used in conjunction with hybridoma mAb production. FACS increased yields of mAbs by 773%, from 22 to 170 positive clones per spleen [72]. \n\nMAbs are routinely produced by hybridomas; replacing them with bacteria is a strategy to reduce the cost of production [73,74]. MAbs produced in bacteria face challenges of protein aggregation, inefficient folding, and low yields [75]. Zhou et al. produced a full-length mAb in E. coli by fusing the signal peptide of disulfide oxidoreductase to the N-terminus of the heavy chain of the mAb to assist in secretion into and accumulation in the periplasm. This tag helped to reduce the bottleneck in production caused by inefficient heavy chain secretion [73]. Plants have also been used to produce Abs cost-effectively.",

Some have demonstrated high potential such as lentivirus, paramyxovirus and adeno-associated-virus (AAV). These vectors are produced in adherent and suspension cell cultures (e.g. HEK293T, A549, VERO, PER.C6, Sf9) using either transient transfection (e.g PEI, calcium phosphate precipitation) or infection (e.g. modified or recombinant viruses) strategies. Most of these processes are currently achieved in static mode on 2-D systems (Roller Bottles, Cell Factories, etc.) or on suspended microcarriers (porous or non-porous). However, these two systems are time-consuming (large numbers of manipulation, preparation of equipment, etc.) and hardly scalable. In regards to process simplification and traceability, Integrity\u00ae iCELLis\u00ae bioreactors offer a new solution for scalability and monitoring of adherent cell cultures. \n \nThe Integrity iCELLis Bioreactor \nIntegrity\u00ae iCELLis\u00ae bioreactors from ATMI LifeSciences were designed for adherent cell culture applications such as recombinant protein, viral vaccine and gene therapy vector production. Using PET carriers trapped into a fixed-bed, cells grow in a 3-D environment with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen controls. The iCELLis technology can be used at small-scale (the iCELLis nano from 0.5 to 4 m2) and manufacturing scale (iCELLis 500 from from 66 to 500 m2) which eases process scale-up and its overall utilization.",

            "text": "reported that because of these increase in titers and economies of scale, mAbs will be a class of biological products with relatively low production costs, although this calculation does not account for many other expenses, such as royalties incurred for accessing either the necessary process technology, or for the antibody sequence or target, in addition to the burdens of the cost of research, sales and failed projects in the research pipeline. This will have critical implications for process development, manufacturing and product lifecycle strategies.\n\nThus, it appears that drug substance COGs will not be a significant driver for process technology decisions for pipeline products as long as reasonable titers (>2 g/L) can be achieved; titers greater than 5 g/L are very unlikely to have a meaningful impact on either capacity or COGs, and even higher titers could have no impact on costs as the bioreactor output would exceed the purification process capacity. For nearly all mAb products, with the exception of blockbusters with a very low sales price, there will be no direct link between mAb drug substance production costs and the future? The potential for high titer cell culture processes operating in existing facilities has identified what appears to be a futile cycle: In the drive for higher titers which generate ever larger batches in the large-scale production facilities, one will eventually exceed the plant's purification capacity (even with new separations media, bottlenecks will be reached), potentially requiring the development of new technologies. Implementation of these new technologies would require more capital investment and retrofitting of the facility to accommodate the non-standard unit operations, which then generates a challenge to managing a multiproduct facility and product changeover. Why spend additional capital, and complicate plant operations, including a potentially expensive shut-down phase to conduct the retrofit? An increase in titer above the purification capacity of a large production plant that then drives development of new purification technology could be counterproductive. This has led to the proposal for future production facilities to be designed for lean and flexible operation, but at relatively small production scale. Disposable bioreactors have been used at up to 2 kL scale, and a plant with disposable cell culture technology would require less capital to build. 19 It has been proposed that these plants could still enable production at high capacities, which isn't",

            "text": "For example, during production, VLP-based vaccines encounter problems due to their lack of a viral genome (essential for the formation of a virus) causing instability in downstream processing [21]. \n\nThe high demand for mAbs is well-founded, and despite the challenges associated with industrial grade production of homogeneous and efficacious product, they have been used in a number of novel applications [22,23]. Research has suggested mAbs, when combined with BBB peptide shuttles, could penetrate the BBB, and deliver an effective treatment for brain metastases [9]. This could occur through the use of antibody fragments to reduce molecular weight, or the incorporation of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) into mAbs to deliver large cargoes across cell membranes, and even the BBB [24]. Another created an affordable immunoassay using 4C9C9 and 4C9E11 mAbs in a sandwich-type UMELISA\u00ae assay to identify cystic fibrosis in newborns, specifically for use in Cuba and other Latin American countries [22]. \n\nIrrespective of the benefits, producing biopharmaceutical drugs has some significant drawbacks. Production requires substantial costs in terms of time, monetary investment, and protocol optimisation. An unfortunate consequence of this is a high cost to the patients. One course of biotherapeutics for arthritis costs around USD $20,000 annually [25], and for Crohn's disease it can exceed USD $44,000 annually [26]. Although this cost can be reduced by the use of biosimilars, it is still essential that efficiency in the process is retained through the minimisation of loss of product. The structural and functional integrity of the drug product must also be preserved throughout the varied conditions required for production, including isolation and storage, and delivery to the patient [27]. \n\nSelected biopharmaceuticals such as therapeutic antibodies and antibody fragments are prone to significant aggregation and misfolding during production and delivery [28]. To make both production and delivery more effective, it is essential to be able to observe, and fully understand the mechanisms by which aggregation and/or unfolding occur. Certain points have been identified in the production pathway where therapeutic proteins are more prone to aggregation or unfolding.",

            "text": "Industry favors recombinant protein expression systems that have a long and successful track record, specifically with three goals in mind: high quality, high yields, and low costs. In addition, such systems should meet the demands of an industrial process with respect to robustness, and economic sustainability, and must comply with regulatory requirements. This is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical proteins produced according to good manufacturing practice (GMP), a set of guidelines ensuring that biopharmaceuticals are sufficient in terms of quality and batch-to-batch consistency in order to prevent harm to patients. The industry has therefore focused its resources on a small number of cell-based systems, in particular CHO cells and E. coli, which are now considered the gold standards for industrial protein manufacturing. \n\nMany complex proteins, including most therapeutic antibodies, are routinely produced in CHO cells because they have the capacity to carry out authentic post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. Recombinant proteins produced in CHO cells are secreted into the culture medium to facilitate recovery and purification. Various strategies have been pursued to maximize the productivity of CHO cell cultures, including: (1) the engineering of production lines and expression vectors, (2) amplification of the expression cassette, (3) optimization of the cell culture medium, including the switch from early formulations containing serum to chemically defined and near protein-free formulations that simplify protein purification even further, (4) increasing the cell density during cultivation, and (5) the introduction of fermentation strategies that balance the nutrient supply while maintaining optimal cultivation conditions (Hausmann et al., 2018;Ritacco et al., 2018). These developments have led to remarkable increases in yields. For example, early processes for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies achieved titers of hundreds of milligrams per liter, but this has increased to routine titers of 5-10 g/L and in some cases up to 20 g/L (Pujar et al., 2017), reducing the cost of goods to as little as \u20ac20/g (Kelley, 2007). Combined with GMP-compliant cell lines and processes and well-established approval procedures, it is hard to imagine that the CHO platform will be displaced by any other expression system for the manufacturing of complex proteins in the near future.",

They play important roles in epidemiology and medicine from diagnostics of diseases to therapeutics, treating diseases from incessant chronic diseases such as rheumatology to pandemic outbreaks. With no end in sight for the demand for antibody products, optimizations and new techniques must be expanded to accommodate this. This review discusses optimizations and techniques for antibody production through choice of discovery platforms, expression systems, cell culture mediums, and other strategies to increase expression yield. Each system has its own merits and demerits, and the strategy chosen is critical in addressing various biological aspects. There is still insufficient evidence to validate the efficacy of some of these techniques, and further research is needed to consolidate these industrial production systems. There is no doubt that more strategies, systems, and pipelines will contribute to enhance biopharmaceutical production.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are commonly manufactured by either discontinuous operations like fed-batch (FB) or continuous processes such as steady-state perfusion. Both process types comprise opposing advantages and disadvantages in areas such as plant utilization, feasible cell densities, media consumption and process monitoring effort. In this study, we show feasibility of a promising novel hybrid process strategy that combines beneficial attributes of both process formats. In detail, our strategy comprises a short duration FB, followed by a fast media exchange and cell density readjustment, marking the start of the next FB cycle. Utilizing a small-scale screening tool, we were able to identify beneficial process parameters, including FB interval duration and reinoculation cell density, that allow for multiple cycles of the outlined process in a reproducible manner. In addition, we could demonstrate scalability of the process to a 5L benchtop system, using a fluidized-bed centrifuge as scalable media exchange system. The novel process showed increased productivity (+217%) as well as longer cultivation duration, in comparison to a standard FB with a significantly lower media consumption per produced product (\u221250%) and a decreased need for process monitoring, in comparison to a perfusion cultivation. Further, the process revealed constant glycosylation pattern in comparison to the perfusion cultivation and has strong potential for further scale-up, due to the use of fully scalable cultivation and media exchange platforms. In summary, we have developed a novel hybrid process strategy that tackles the key challenges of current biomanufacturing of either low productivity or high media consumption, representing a new and innovative approach for future process intensification efforts.",

            "text": "In recent years, the demand for biopharmaceuticals has been increasing and innovative and improved bioprocessing technologies are essential to meet the demand for industrial production of products. As an important part of biological drugs, recombinant therapeutic proteins (RTPs), especially RTPs represented by recombinant antibodies, have achieved good efficacy and great economic benefits and have received more and more attention. Mammalian cells have become the main host cells for the production of RTPs because of their ability to perform post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as correct folding and glycosylation of recombinant proteins. Since the production of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in 1986, CHO cells have become the production host of most approved recombinant proteins and recombinant antibody drugs due to their high density suspension growth, PTMs similar to humanized cells, easy gene operation and process scale-up. This expression system has been used to produce 84% of the antibodies approved during 2015-2018, accounting for more than half of all approved antibodies during this period (Walsh, 2018). By 2019, all six of the top ten best-selling drugs were produced in CHO cells (Urquhart, 2020). RTPs are the fastest growing part of the biopharmaceutical industry, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving an average of more than 25 new approvals per year from 2014 to 2020. It is predicted that the global biopharmaceutical market value will reach $389 million by 2024 (O'Flaherty et al., 2020). \n\nWith the advancement of CHO cell line development and process optimization, the yields of recombinant mAbs (monoclonal antibodies, mAbs) of CHO cells have achieved as high as 5 g/L, or even more than 10 g/L (Alves and Dobrowsky, 2017;Handlogten et al., 2018). Although CHO cell platforms have been widely used to produce RTPs, there are still inherent limitations in the synthesis and secretion of many complex RTPs, such as low productivity, growth restriction and expression instability, low resistance to culture-related stresses and high costs of production.",

            "text": "Currently, most commercial mAbs are produced in mammalian cells (e.g. CHO, NS0) engineered to secrete large quantities of antibodies (typically in the 1-10 gram/liter range). Stainlesssteel bioreactors have historically been used for large-scale production, though single-use bioreactors have become more common in recent years due to the reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs (clean-up operations are quicker) and reduced costs with respect to upfront investment as well as ongoing operational/maintenance expenses. Manufacturers specializing in one product generally tend to use stainlesssteel bioreactors, while single-use bioreactors are often used by contract manufacturers who produce a variety of different products. Setting up new manufacturing capacity has a significant lead time; modular platforms are being completed within 18 months while traditional fixed facilities can require several years. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be used to produce mAbs at scale and require significantly lower capital investment to construct. This technology has enabled the development of global mAb production facilities via distributed manufacturing. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes are also faster and cheaper and may offer more consistent processing and greater product quality. Economic analyses of continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes (referred to as integrated continuous processing) can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing, when both capital and operating expenses are considered. 59,60 Indeed, a recent analysis suggests that commercial scale continuous process production could achieve COGs of $25/g. 60 istorically, 12-18 months has been the rule of thumb for estimating the time from the availability of mAb genes to release of GMP material; however, new strategies using transient expression for supply of Phase 1 drug while establishing a GMP stable clone for later stages of development may become more common and is the strategy that enabled multiple mAb drugs to rapidly enter clinical trials for COVID-19.",

Islet transplantation offers a promising solution but faces challenges such as limited availability and the need for immunosuppression. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential alternative source of functional \u03b2-cells and have the capability for large-scale production. However, current differentiation protocols, predominantly conducted in hybrid or 2D settings, lack scalability and optimal conditions for suspension culture. Methods We examined a range of bioreactor scaleup process parameters and quality target product profiles that might affect the differentiation process. This investigation was conducted using an optimized High Dimensional Design of Experiments (HD-DoE) protocol designed for scalability and implemented in 0.5L (PBS-0.5 Mini) vertical wheel bioreactors. Results A three stage suspension manufacturing process is developed, transitioning from adherent to suspension culture, with TB2 media supporting iPSC growth during scaling. Stage-wise optimization approaches and extended differentiation times are used to enhance marker expression and maturation of iPSC-derived islet-like clusters. Continuous bioreactor runs were used to study nutrient and growth limitations and impact on differentiation. The continuous bioreactors were compared to a Control media change bioreactor showing metabolic shifts and a more \u03b2-cell-like differentiation profile. Cryopreserved aggregates harvested from the runs were recovered and showed maintenance of viability and insulin secretion capacity post-recovery, indicating their potential for storage and future transplantation therapies. Conclusion This study demonstrated that stage time increase and limited media replenishing with lactate accumulation can increase the differentiation capacity of insulin producing cells cultured in a large-scale suspension environment.

These applications have been studied, especially for outdoor spaces, precisely because of the scale that production with robotic arms allows. Green areas within urban spaces are one of these outdoor spaces, which provide space for leisure and recreation, which leads to social improvements by gathering people. In this context, this research seeks to create products that improve social interaction within urban green spaces. To achieve this, sustainable products will be developed, through a large-scale robotic extrusion-based system, combining the versatility and design possibilities that additive manufacturing allows, with the associated sustainability of recycled plastic waste. Thus, this paper proposes a methodology for validating recycled materials and to understand the limitations that the material brings to the parametric models created and the challenges for production. For that, two sample-parts were developed.

            "text": "The production of products in additive manufacturing systems through the extrusion of material using robotic arms requires new paradigms ranging from product design, material selection, material processability, communication with the production system, production control, etc. The development of products through these technologies allows the production of solutions of considerable scale and innovation. These applications have been studied, especially for outdoor spaces, precisely because of the scale that production with robotic arms allows. Green areas within urban spaces are one of these outdoor spaces, which provide space for leisure and recreation, which leads to social improvements by gathering people. In this context, this research seeks to create products that improve social interaction within urban green spaces. To achieve this, sustainable products will be developed, through a large-scale robotic extrusion-based system, combining the versatility and design possibilities that additive manufacturing allows, with the associated sustainability of recycled plastic waste. Thus, this paper proposes a methodology for validating recycled materials and to understand the limitations that the material brings to the parametric models created and the challenges for production. For that, two sample-parts were developed. One part allowed to understand the maximum printing angle, and the other provided an understanding of the behavior of the material when the part had corners with different curvatures. Finally, an outdoor product to be placed in the urban space was developed and produced with the production parameters studied.",

This process can introduce treatment delays due to logistical requirements. We hypothesized that point-of-care (POC) manufacturing of CAR T cells could reduce vein to vein time which is one of the major challenges with commercial CAR T processes. This study presents the outcomes of large-scale, clinical-grade, in-house POC CAR T manufacturing, including assessments of transduction efficiency, vector copy number, phenotype, and effector function of CAR T cells. Utilizing the CliniMACS Prodigy system, we processed mononuclear cells from fresh leukapheresis harvests of healthy donors. The cells underwent automated processing and activation with TransAct, a polymeric nanomatrix activation reagent containing CD3/CD28-specific antibodies. Following activation, the cells were transduced and expanded in the Centricult-unit under stabilized conditions, with automated feeding and media exchange. For transduction, we employed the Miltenyi Lentigen third-generation lentiviral vector, which delivers a second-generation CD19 CAR construct with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and TNFRSF19 transmembrane domain. Our POC manufacturing data demonstrated the successful generation of large-scale CAR T cells, sufficient to prepare multiple doses within a shortened production period of 9 days, followed by cryopreservation for quality control assessment and batch certification for patient infusion. The transduction efficiencies, phenotype, and function of the Lentigen CD19 CAR T cells were comparable to previously published procedures, with overall T-cell yields sufficient for therapeutic application. CAR expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and vector copy number. In-process testing ensured the quality and suitability of CAR T cells in terms of sterility and cell number for the desired dose preparations. The final product was also subjected for the assessment of any replicative competent lentivirus. CAR-mediated target cell killing was assessed via co-culture assays, and cytokine release was measured by ELISA. To evaluate the shelf life of the cryopreserved product, stability and viability were checked at approximately 6 and 12 months. Our results indicate that in-house POC manufacturing at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC) enables regulatory-compliant production of CAR T cells, eliminating the need for third-party shipping logistics.",

To assure the compatibility with low-cost flexible substrates in high-throughput printing techniques, a low annealing temperature of 140 \u00b0C was achieved for these thin films by combining SCS and infrared annealing in a short processing time. These conditions allowed the transition from spin-coating (lab scale) to flexographic printing (fab scale) at a printing speed of 10 m min\u22121 in a roll-to-roll pilot line. The ZTO (1:1 Zn:Sn-ratio) diodes show a rectification ratio of 103, a low operation voltage (\u2a7d3 V), promising reproducibility and low variability.

Nonetheless, removal and inactivation of recombinant baculoviruses during downstream purification of rAAV vectors remain critical prior to clinical application. Methods The present study utilized a newly developed fluorescent-TCID50 (F-TCID50) assay to determine the infectious titer of recombinant baculovirus (rBV) stock after baculovirus removal and inactivation, and to evaluate the impact of various reagents and solutions on rBV infectivity. Results and discussion The results showed that a combination of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and Triton X-100 lysis, AAVx affinity chromatography, low pH hold (pH3.0), CsCl ultracentrifugation, and NFR filtration led to effective removal and/or inactivation of recombinant baculoviruses, and achieved a log reduction value (LRV) of more than 18.9 for the entire AAV purification process.

However, the manufacturing of rAAV viral vectors remains challenging in the upstream processing with low rAAV yield in large-scale production and high cost, limiting the generalization of rAAV-based treatments. This situation can be improved by real-time monitoring of critical process parameters (CPP) that affect critical quality attributes (CQA). To achieve this aim, soft sensing combined with predictive modeling is an important strategy that can be used for optimizing the upstream process of rAAV production by monitoring critical process variables in real time. However, the development of soft sensors for rAAV production as a fast and low-cost monitoring approach is not an easy task. This review article describes four challenges and critically discusses the possible solutions that can enable the application of soft sensors for rAAV production monitoring. The challenges from a data scientist\u2019s perspective are (i) a predictor variable (soft-sensor inputs) set without AAV viral titer, (ii) multi-step forecasting, (iii) multiple process phases, and (iv) soft-sensor development composed of the mechanistic model.",

These fabs leverage their immense production capacity, economies of scale, and advanced technologies. A key feature of GIGA fabs is their high level of automation, large-scale production, and complex technical requirements, which heavily rely on Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS). The AMHS in GIGA fabs is not only critical to production efficiency but also plays a vital role in yield control, turnover efficiency, and is foundational to achieving intelligent manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Therefore, optimizing and innovating AMHS for GIGA fabs is a crucial direction for the semiconductor industry's future development. Historically, AMHS solutions in GIGA fabs were monopolized by DFK/MURATEC, but with the rise of domestic AMHS integrators, new innovations are emerging in the actual implementation of FAB projects. This paper presents the innovative designs proposed by HIMC in response to the challenges faced by AMHS systems in GIGA fabs.

To address the complexity of decision-making, an innovative two-level encoding method that encompasses four decision dimensions is introduced. Additionally, an incremental repair strategy is devised to rectify infeasible solutions caused by unreasonable delivery batching, while a time relaxation strategy is proposed to further enhance service levels without compromising energy consumption. Comparative experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of SGMAOA, which is benchmarked against five prominent metaheuristics.

Bioprocessing f luids are processed incrementally, piped as a bolus or transferred via vessels from one process and piece of equipment to the next. This continues to work well, including a number of technological advances resulting in improvements that continue to make bioprocessing more efficient. Upstream and overall process yields are essentially doubling about every five years, with this largely driven by improved cell lines, expression systems and genetic engineering, culture media, and equipment. Among the technologies now gaining increasing adoption and market share for biopharmaceutical manufacture is continuous (bio) processing, with perfusion currently the leading technology, in terms of adoption. The use of incremental, one-step-at-a-time, classic batch processing in biopharmaceutical manufacture is different than most other major products manufacturing and high-tech industries, where processing is generally more continuous. In this context, the move toward more continuous processing in manufacturing is a common characteristic of industries starting to reach maturity. Continuous processing is exemplified by assembly lines, and petroleum refining with processing involving a rather continuous flow of the material being manufactured from one unit operation to the next. Continuous processing generally follows and eventually replaces incremental manufacturing. Continuous processing generally requires more process knowledge, equipment and technological advances than incremental manufacturing. Successful adoption of continuous processing by any industry requires each of the component processes involved to be more integrated, at least with the next process. Continuous processing requires a sufficient critical mass of technological competencies and available equipment capable of supporting process integration. For example, implementing continuous bioprocessing, such as upstream perfusion, is not practical if the next and following steps are unable to handle this output. This article reviews and details some of the key advances and trends in the bioprocessing industry that have emerged which are creating greater adoption and potential for continuous processing as the industry matures. We evaluate aspects of continuous processing, exemplified by perfusion, and the adoption of these technologies by the biopharmaceutical manufacturing (bioprocessing) industry.",

                "snippets": "Currently, most commercial mAbs are produced in mammalian cells (e.g. CHO, NS0) engineered to secrete large quantities of antibodies (typically in the 1-10 gram/liter range). Stainlesssteel bioreactors have historically been used for large-scale production, though single-use bioreactors have become more common in recent years due to the reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs (clean-up operations are quicker) and reduced costs with respect to upfront investment as well as ongoing operational/maintenance expenses. Manufacturers specializing in one product generally tend to use stainlesssteel bioreactors, while single-use bioreactors are often used by contract manufacturers who produce a variety of different products. Setting up new manufacturing capacity has a significant lead time; modular platforms are being completed within 18 months while traditional fixed facilities can require several years. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be used to produce mAbs at scale and require significantly lower capital investment to construct. This technology has enabled the development of global mAb production facilities via distributed manufacturing. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes are also faster and cheaper and may offer more consistent processing and greater product quality. Economic analyses of continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes (referred to as integrated continuous processing) can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing, when both capital and operating expenses are considered.",

Stainlesssteel bioreactors have historically been used for large-scale production, though single-use bioreactors have become more common in recent years due to the reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs (clean-up operations are quicker) and reduced costs with respect to upfront investment as well as ongoing operational/maintenance expenses. Manufacturers specializing in one product generally tend to use stainlesssteel bioreactors, while single-use bioreactors are often used by contract manufacturers who produce a variety of different products. Setting up new manufacturing capacity has a significant lead time; modular platforms are being completed within 18 months while traditional fixed facilities can require several years. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be used to produce mAbs at scale and require significantly lower capital investment to construct. This technology has enabled the development of global mAb production facilities via distributed manufacturing. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes are also faster and cheaper and may offer more consistent processing and greater product quality. Economic analyses of continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes (referred to as integrated continuous processing) can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing, when both capital and operating expenses are considered."

Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies (Frandsen et al., 2011). Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (Robak et al., 2012) but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies...Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters (Jesus et al., 2011). Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses.",

In a phase 1 or 2 dose escalation study, RhD(+) patients (61 subjects) with primary immune thrombocytopenia received a single intravenous dose of rozrolimupab ranging from 75 to 300 \u03bcg/kg. The primary outcome was the occurrence of adverse events. The principal secondary outcome was the effect on platelet levels 7 days after the treatment. The most common adverse events were headache and pyrexia, mostly mild, and reported in 20% and 13% of the patients, respectively, without dose relationship. Rozrolimupab caused an expected transient reduction of hemoglobin concentration in the majority of the patients. At the dose of 300 \u03bcg/kg platelet responses, defined as platelet count \u2265 30 \u00d7 10(9)/L and an increase in platelet count by > 20 \u00d7 10(9)/L from baseline were observed after 72 hours and persisted for at least 7 days in 8 of 13 patients (62%). Platelet responses were observed within 24 hours in 23% of patients and lasted for a median of 14 days. Rozrolimupab was well tolerated and elicited rapid platelet responses in patients with immune thrombocytopenia and may be a useful alternative to plasma-derived products. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00718692."

Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch et al., 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. (Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012).",

The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies."

Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch et al., 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. (Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012)."

Their stability, resistance to stress conditions and high solubility have allowed the successful development and commercialization of over 40 antibody-based drugs. Although mAbs enjoy a relatively high probability of success compared with other therapeutic proteins, examples of projects that are suspended due to the instability of the molecule are not uncommon. Developability assessment studies have therefore been devised to identify early during process development problems associated with stability, solubility that is insufficient to meet expected dosing or sensitivity to stress. This set of experiments includes short-term stability studies at 2\u22128 \u00feC, 25 \u00feC and 40 \u00feC, freeze-thaw studies, limited forced degradation studies and determination of the viscosity of high concentration samples. We present here three case studies reflecting three typical outcomes: (1) no major or unexpected degradation is found and the study results are used to inform early identification of degradation pathways and potential critical quality attributes within the Quality by Design framework defined by US Food and Drug Administration guidance documents; (2) identification of specific degradation pathway(s) that do not affect potency of the molecule, with subsequent definition of proper process control and formulation strategies; and (3) identification of degradation that affects potency, resulting in program termination and reallocation of resources.",

Although the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate will be well considered by sponsors and regulatory agencies, developability in the narrow sense can be defined as the likelihood that an antibody candidate will go smoothly through the chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) process at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable timeline. Developability in this sense is the focus of this review. To lower the risk that an antibody candidate with poor developability will move to the CMC stage, the candidate\u2019s developability-related properties should be screened, assessed and optimized as early as possible. Assessment of developability at the early discovery stage should be performed in a rapid and high-throughput manner while consuming small amounts of testing materials. In addition to monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates, as the derivatives of monoclonal antibodies, should also be assessed for developability. Moreover, we propose that the criterion of developability is relative: expected clinical indication, and the dosage and administration route of the antibody could affect this criterion. We also recommend a general screening process during the early discovery stage of antibody-derived therapeutics. With the advance of artificial intelligence-aided prediction of protein structures and features, computational tools can be used to predict, screen and optimize the developability of antibody candidates and greatly reduce the risk of moving a suboptimal candidate to the development stage.",

The concept of developability is based on the knowledge gained from the successful development of approximately 80 marketed antibody and Fc-fusion protein drug products and from the lessons learned from many failed development programs over the last three decades. Here, we reviewed antibody quality attributes that are critical to development and traditional and state-of-the-art analytical methods to monitor those attributes. Based on our collective experiences, a practical workflow is proposed as a best practice for developability assessment including in silico evaluation, extended characterization and forced degradation using appropriate analytical methods that allow characterization with limited material consumption and fast turnaround time."

A decisional tool was built that integrated cost of goods (COG) with the cost of development models and new equipment sizing equations tailored to batch, hybrid, and end\u2010to\u2010end continuous processes. The COG analysis predicted that single\u2010use continuous facilities (sized using a dedicated downstream processing train per bioreactor) offer more significant commercial COG savings over stainless steel batch facilities at annual demands of 100\u2013500\u2009kg (~35%), compared to tonnage demands of 1\u20133 tons (~\u00b110%) that required multiple parallel continuous trains. Single\u2010use batch facilities were found to compete with continuous options on COG only at 100\u2009kg/year. For the scenarios where batch and continuous facilities offered similar COG, the analysis identified the windows of operation required to reach different COG savings with thresholds for the perfusion rate, volumetric productivity, and media cost. When considering the project lifecycle cost, the analysis indicated that while end\u2010to\u2010end continuous facilities may struggle to compete on development costs, they become more cost\u2010effective than stainless steel batch facilities when considering the total out\u2010of\u2010pocket cost across both drug development and commercial activities."

For antibody manufacturing process development, maintaining desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, maintaining cost effectiveness, and providing manufacturing flexibility are key issues in today's competitive market, where several companies are often working on therapies for similar targets and clinical indications. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, manufacturing capacity becomes an issue because the drug substance must be produced in large quantities with cost and time efficiency to meet clinical requirements and pave the way toward commercialization. In response to the strong demand, many companies have built large scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors."

Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge.

The first fully human mAb (adalimumab) was approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis in 2002.5 As of March 2012, the number of US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved, actively marketed therapeutic mAbs for use in oncology/hematology, immunomodulatory settings, and other miscellaneous conditions is approaching 30 (Table 1).

It is important to identify high impact components early on during the lifecycle of a biotechnology\u2010derived product. While cell culture media selection is of obvious importance to the health and productivity of mammalian bioreactor operations, other components such as antifoam selection can also play an important role in bioreactor cell culture. Silicone polymer\u2010based antifoams were known to have negative impacts on cell health, production, and downstream filtration and purification operations. High throughput screening in micro\u2010scale bioreactors provides an efficient strategy to identify initial operating parameters. Here, we utilized a micro\u2010scale parallel bioreactor system to study an IgG1 producing CHO cell line, to screen Dynamis, ProCHO5, PowerCHO2, EX\u2010Cell Advanced, and OptiCHO media, and 204, C, EX\u2010Cell, SE\u201015, and Y\u201030 antifoams and their impacts on IgG1 production, cell growth, aggregation, and process control.

This rapid growth has driven manufacturers to develop innovative solutions for large-scale production to meet expanding clinical and commercial demands <Paper corpusId=\"43129756\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, biologics such as mAbs are large, complex molecules produced in living systems including bacteria and mammalian cells. Their molecular structure consists of over 1300 amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons and numerous post-translational modifications <Paper corpusId=\"52079235\" paperTitle=\"(Melsheimer et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This complexity introduces significant variability in the production process, requiring careful control of manufacturing conditions.\n\nAs production demands increase, manufacturers face the challenge of purification on larger scales, with some batches reaching up to 100 kg, necessitating innovative purification methodologies <Paper corpusId=\"13884331\" paperTitle=\"(Murphy et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address these challenges, platform manufacturing processes have emerged for monoclonal antibodies, standardizing unit operations and reducing development time for new molecules <Paper corpusId=\"232039925\" paperTitle=\"(Crowell et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, more diverse biopharmaceutical pipelines often require unique production and purification processes, adding complexity to large-scale manufacturing.\n\nThe industry has responded by building large-scale manufacturing facilities with multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors <Paper corpusId=\"43129756\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Both traditional fed-batch cell cultivation for high-quality mAbs and continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors for challenging molecules are utilized to optimize production <Paper corpusId=\"267845612\" paperTitle=\"(Sewell et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The latter approach has proven beneficial for products like infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titers <Paper corpusId=\"267845612\" paperTitle=\"(Sewell et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"25001402\" paperTitle=\"(Kelley, 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCost considerations are also driving manufacturing innovations, with pressure to reduce the cost of goods (CoGs) to remain competitive and to make therapies more affordable <Paper corpusId=\"265464221\" paperTitle=\"(Olin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This is particularly important for diagnostic applications, where there is demand for rapid tests costing less than $1, making cost-effective production methods like those using Escherichia coli vital <Paper corpusId=\"237387732\" paperTitle=\"(Huleani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the development of antibody combination therapeutics (ACTs) for complex diseases presents unique manufacturing challenges due to the cost-prohibitive nature of independently manufacturing and mixing multiple monoclonal antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"24135749\" paperTitle=\"(Wilmes et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Since the approval of the first licensed monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, the demand for mAbs as therapeutic agents has developed into a multi-billion dollar per year market (Liu, 2014). Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch et al., 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. (Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012)."

One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources."

                            "In this summary, we review the challenges associated with manufacturing large-volume biologics and the measures needed to ensure high-quality, long-term consistency and adequate supply by presentation of the example of one of the most widely used biologics today, Remicade.\n\nIn contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

In a platform process, the overall unit operations and order of these operations are standardized. Each new product, therefore, requires only minimal optimization of these steps. Biopharmaceutical pipelines are becoming more diverse, however, and other classes of biologics generally require unique production and purification processes, even for similar molecules (Morrison, 2020).

(9 sources)",
                "text": "\nMammalian cell culture, particularly Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, dominates commercial recombinant antibody production due to their ability to produce proteins with human-like post-translational modifications and adaptability to serum-free media <Paper corpusId=\"52982930\" paperTitle=\"(Velugula-Yellela et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These production systems have undergone remarkable evolution, with average yields for commercial monoclonal antibody (mAb) production typically reaching 5-6 g/L and continuing to rise <Paper corpusId=\"52982930\" paperTitle=\"(Velugula-Yellela et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even more impressively, industrial IgG production levels often exceed 12 g/L, with the highest reported titer reaching 27 g/L in the human embryonic retinal cell line Per.C6 <Paper corpusId=\"8559221\" paperTitle=\"(Frenzel et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe manufacturing landscape currently employs two primary approaches: fed-batch cultivation and continuous bioprocessing. Fed-batch cultures have traditionally been used to produce high quantities of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"235270874\" paperTitle=\"(Donaldson et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, for next-generation biotherapeutics such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins that are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes, manufacturers are increasingly adopting strategies that decouple cell growth from production <Paper corpusId=\"235270874\" paperTitle=\"(Donaldson et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach allows cellular resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, enhancing the production of difficult-to-express proteins <Paper corpusId=\"235270874\" paperTitle=\"(Donaldson et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn parallel, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors has gained traction for molecules that prove challenging to express or recover <Paper corpusId=\"267845612\" paperTitle=\"(Sewell et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The shorter bioreactor residence times and continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products enable cells to reach higher concentrations and improve total functional production <Paper corpusId=\"267845612\" paperTitle=\"(Sewell et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has proven particularly beneficial for products like infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited low titers <Paper corpusId=\"267845612\" paperTitle=\"(Sewell et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"25001402\" paperTitle=\"(Kelley, 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe physical infrastructure of manufacturing has also evolved. Historically, stainless-steel bioreactors were used for large-scale production, but single-use bioreactors have become increasingly common <Paper corpusId=\"235823004\" paperTitle=\"(Whaley et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The shift toward single-use systems offers advantages including reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs, lower upfront investment costs, and decreased operational and maintenance expenses <Paper corpusId=\"235823004\" paperTitle=\"(Whaley et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be deployed to produce mAbs at scale with significantly lower capital investment, enabling the development of global production facilities through distributed manufacturing <Paper corpusId=\"235823004\" paperTitle=\"(Whaley et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe industry is also seeing a gradual transition from batch to continuous processing, driven by increasing demand, cost reduction pressures, requirements for consistent quality, and the need for higher productivity <Paper corpusId=\"52883669\" paperTitle=\"(Cankorur-Cetinkaya et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes offer advantages including faster production, lower costs, more consistent processing, and potentially greater product quality <Paper corpusId=\"235823004\" paperTitle=\"(Whaley et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Economic analyses suggest that continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing when considering both capital and operating expenses <Paper corpusId=\"235823004\" paperTitle=\"(Whaley et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor specialized applications like recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins, which consist of thousands of different antibodies, researchers have demonstrated that existing infrastructure for mAb manufacturing can be repurposed without constructing new facilities <Paper corpusId=\"250712798\" paperTitle=\"(Mizrahi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This adaptability highlights the flexibility of current manufacturing approaches to accommodate novel therapeutic modalities.\n\nThe dramatic improvements in antibody production have been achieved through a combination of cell engineering, process optimization, and advancements in media formulation and feeding strategies <Paper corpusId=\"52982930\" paperTitle=\"(Velugula-Yellela et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Today, industrial IgG production levels often exceed 12 g/L as the result of a steadily ongoing progress in mammalian cell culture technology, which is mainly due to improved high producer cell lines, optimized production media, and prolonged production processes at high-cell densities. The highest reported IgG production titer we found was obtained in the human embryonic retinal cell line Per.C6 [Crucell, Leiden, Netherlands, (Jones et al., 2003)] with 27 g/L. Generally, the productivity of recombinant mammalian cell lines increased from initially 10 pg antibody per cell per day (pcd) in 1986 to about 90 pcd in 2004. Today, the antibody production levels only rarely exceed 100 pcd because higher cellular productivity usually corresponds to lower maximum cell densities in the production process. Producer cell lines have also been genetically engineered regarding product homogeneity, improved metabolism, reduced apoptosis, and inducible cell cycle arrest (Butler, 2005)(Fussenegger et al., 1998) which allows prolonged production times for almost 3 weeks at high-cell viability and cell densities."

                            "Fed-batch cultures of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells have been used to produce high quantities of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies. However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins."

Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch et al., 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. (Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012)."

Stainlesssteel bioreactors have historically been used for large-scale production, though single-use bioreactors have become more common in recent years due to the reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs (clean-up operations are quicker) and reduced costs with respect to upfront investment as well as ongoing operational/maintenance expenses. Manufacturers specializing in one product generally tend to use stainlesssteel bioreactors, while single-use bioreactors are often used by contract manufacturers who produce a variety of different products. Setting up new manufacturing capacity has a significant lead time; modular platforms are being completed within 18 months while traditional fixed facilities can require several years. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be used to produce mAbs at scale and require significantly lower capital investment to construct. This technology has enabled the development of global mAb production facilities via distributed manufacturing. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes are also faster and cheaper and may offer more consistent processing and greater product quality. Economic analyses of continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes (referred to as integrated continuous processing) can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing, when both capital and operating expenses are considered."

Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies (Frandsen et al., 2011). Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (Robak et al., 2012) but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies",
                            "Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters (Jesus et al., 2011). Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses."

                            "Technologies to manufacture antibodies have had a continuous evolution over the past 50 years but there is still a need for new technologies to address challenges in selectivity, stability, higher efficacy, reduced immunogenicity and side effects in humans. Costs of production is another key element toward a new technology because it would impact therapy expenses, which in turn has a huge pharmaco-economic burden for both patients and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nFigure 2 summarizes the challenges and opportunities that are associated with different expression platforms in regards to antibody fragment production. Expression systems are categorized into four main systems: bacterial, mammalian, plants and viral (insect cells). Bacteria expression systems are low cost capable of producing a high yield of the majority of simple proteins and peptides that are not glycosylated. Because the recombinant vector may be injected directly into the bacterial host without virus contamination by humans and bacteria, there is no requirement for any additional stage of viral eradication. Bacteria on the other hand are unable to perform posttranslational protein modifications, such as glycosylation, g-carboxylation, phosphorylation and sulfitation [127]. Proteins that are inactive but have the correct molecular structure can also be produced by bacteria, which can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies. In addition, bacteria are capable of removing signal peptides, but they are unable to degrade preproteins, such as native coagulation growth factors [127]. Endotoxins, which are produced by bacteria during the expression, are notoriously difficult to eradicate and make the purification process difficult."

                            "The fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode (Gilbert et al., 2013)(Hilal-Alnaqbi et al., 2013)(Kshirsagar et al., 2012). The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls (Gilbert et al., 2013)(Kshirsagar et al., 2012)(Abu-Absi et al., 2010). Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices (Abaci et al., 2011)."

                            "In this summary, we review the challenges associated with manufacturing large-volume biologics and the measures needed to ensure high-quality, long-term consistency and adequate supply by presentation of the example of one of the most widely used biologics today, Remicade.\n\nIn contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

It also poses regulatory concerns over the effectiveness of commercially available formulations. In vitro chemoenzymatic glycoengineering of variants displaying a homogeneous glycan profile is a trending strategy for ensuring consistent, controlled, and enhanced therapeutic performance, but reported successes are largely limited to small-scale applications. The major challenges for the industrial-scale introduction of the technique stem from the need for activated sugar donors, which can participate in undesired side reactions, and from the economic cost of the additional enzymatic steps and purification stages."

Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

                            "Manufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, (P\u00e9rez et al., 2021) which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible (Zhang et al., 2022)(Yang et al., 2013). Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial (Ma et al., 2020)(Xu et al., 2019)."

                            "Monoclonal antibodies constitute a robust class of therapeutic proteins. Their stability, resistance to stress conditions and high solubility have allowed the successful development and commercialization of over 40 antibody-based drugs. Although mAbs enjoy a relatively high probability of success compared with other therapeutic proteins, examples of projects that are suspended due to the instability of the molecule are not uncommon. Developability assessment studies have therefore been devised to identify early during process development problems associated with stability, solubility that is insufficient to meet expected dosing or sensitivity to stress. This set of experiments includes short-term stability studies at 2\u22128 \u00feC, 25 \u00feC and 40 \u00feC, freeze-thaw studies, limited forced degradation studies and determination of the viscosity of high concentration samples. We present here three case studies reflecting three typical outcomes: (1) no major or unexpected degradation is found and the study results are used to inform early identification of degradation pathways and potential critical quality attributes within the Quality by Design framework defined by US Food and Drug Administration guidance documents; (2) identification of specific degradation pathway(s) that do not affect potency of the molecule, with subsequent definition of proper process control and formulation strategies; and (3) identification of degradation that affects potency, resulting in program termination and reallocation of resources."

                            "Abstract Developability refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will become a manufacturable, safe and efficacious drug. Although the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate will be well considered by sponsors and regulatory agencies, developability in the narrow sense can be defined as the likelihood that an antibody candidate will go smoothly through the chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) process at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable timeline. Developability in this sense is the focus of this review. To lower the risk that an antibody candidate with poor developability will move to the CMC stage, the candidate\u2019s developability-related properties should be screened, assessed and optimized as early as possible. Assessment of developability at the early discovery stage should be performed in a rapid and high-throughput manner while consuming small amounts of testing materials. In addition to monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates, as the derivatives of monoclonal antibodies, should also be assessed for developability. Moreover, we propose that the criterion of developability is relative: expected clinical indication, and the dosage and administration route of the antibody could affect this criterion. We also recommend a general screening process during the early discovery stage of antibody-derived therapeutics. With the advance of artificial intelligence-aided prediction of protein structures and features, computational tools can be used to predict, screen and optimize the developability of antibody candidates and greatly reduce the risk of moving a suboptimal candidate to the development stage."

                            "ABSTRACT Increasing attention has been paid to developability assessment with the understanding that thorough evaluation of monoclonal antibody lead candidates at an early stage can avoid delays during late-stage development. The concept of developability is based on the knowledge gained from the successful development of approximately 80 marketed antibody and Fc-fusion protein drug products and from the lessons learned from many failed development programs over the last three decades. Here, we reviewed antibody quality attributes that are critical to development and traditional and state-of-the-art analytical methods to monitor those attributes. Based on our collective experiences, a practical workflow is proposed as a best practice for developability assessment including in silico evaluation, extended characterization and forced degradation using appropriate analytical methods that allow characterization with limited material consumption and fast turnaround time."

                            "This article presents a systematic approach to evaluate the business case for continuous processing that captures trade\u2010offs between manufacturing and development costs for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A decisional tool was built that integrated cost of goods (COG) with the cost of development models and new equipment sizing equations tailored to batch, hybrid, and end\u2010to\u2010end continuous processes. The COG analysis predicted that single\u2010use continuous facilities (sized using a dedicated downstream processing train per bioreactor) offer more significant commercial COG savings over stainless steel batch facilities at annual demands of 100\u2013500\u2009kg (~35%), compared to tonnage demands of 1\u20133 tons (~\u00b110%) that required multiple parallel continuous trains. Single\u2010use batch facilities were found to compete with continuous options on COG only at 100\u2009kg/year. For the scenarios where batch and continuous facilities offered similar COG, the analysis identified the windows of operation required to reach different COG savings with thresholds for the perfusion rate, volumetric productivity, and media cost. When considering the project lifecycle cost, the analysis indicated that while end\u2010to\u2010end continuous facilities may struggle to compete on development costs, they become more cost\u2010effective than stainless steel batch facilities when considering the total out\u2010of\u2010pocket cost across both drug development and commercial activities."

However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins."

                            "Currently, most commercial mAbs are produced in mammalian cells (e.g. CHO, NS0) engineered to secrete large quantities of antibodies (typically in the 1-10 gram/liter range). Stainlesssteel bioreactors have historically been used for large-scale production, though single-use bioreactors have become more common in recent years due to the reduced turnaround time between manufacturing runs (clean-up operations are quicker) and reduced costs with respect to upfront investment as well as ongoing operational/maintenance expenses. Manufacturers specializing in one product generally tend to use stainlesssteel bioreactors, while single-use bioreactors are often used by contract manufacturers who produce a variety of different products. Setting up new manufacturing capacity has a significant lead time; modular platforms are being completed within 18 months while traditional fixed facilities can require several years. Multiple single-use bioreactors can be used to produce mAbs at scale and require significantly lower capital investment to construct. This technology has enabled the development of global mAb production facilities via distributed manufacturing. Integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes are also faster and cheaper and may offer more consistent processing and greater product quality. Economic analyses of continuous biomanufacturing coupled with continuous chromatographic processes (referred to as integrated continuous processing) can reduce costs by 55% compared to conventional batch processing, when both capital and operating expenses are considered."

                            "GIGA-2050 is the first example of a new class of drugs, recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins. Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies (Frandsen et al., 2011). Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (Robak et al., 2012) but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies",
                            "Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters (Jesus et al., 2011). Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses."

                            "Technologies to manufacture antibodies have had a continuous evolution over the past 50 years but there is still a need for new technologies to address challenges in selectivity, stability, higher efficacy, reduced immunogenicity and side effects in humans. Costs of production is another key element toward a new technology because it would impact therapy expenses, which in turn has a huge pharmaco-economic burden for both patients and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nFigure 2 summarizes the challenges and opportunities that are associated with different expression platforms in regards to antibody fragment production. Expression systems are categorized into four main systems: bacterial, mammalian, plants and viral (insect cells). Bacteria expression systems are low cost capable of producing a high yield of the majority of simple proteins and peptides that are not glycosylated. Because the recombinant vector may be injected directly into the bacterial host without virus contamination by humans and bacteria, there is no requirement for any additional stage of viral eradication. Bacteria on the other hand are unable to perform posttranslational protein modifications, such as glycosylation, g-carboxylation, phosphorylation and sulfitation [127]. Proteins that are inactive but have the correct molecular structure can also be produced by bacteria, which can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies. In addition, bacteria are capable of removing signal peptides, but they are unable to degrade preproteins, such as native coagulation growth factors [127]. Endotoxins, which are produced by bacteria during the expression, are notoriously difficult to eradicate and make the purification process difficult."

                            "However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

Manufacturing capacity has expanded dramatically through both large-scale facilities and process improvements that have increased yields and reduced production costs. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe economics of large-scale recombinant antibody manufacturing present both challenges and opportunities for biopharmaceutical companies. As the monoclonal antibody market expands rapidly\u2014projected to grow from $115.2 billion in 2018 to approximately $300 billion by 2025\u2014manufacturers face intense pressure to reduce production costs while scaling up capacity <Paper corpusId=\"265464221\" paperTitle=\"(Olin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This cost reduction is essential not only for remaining competitive in the growing manufacturing landscape but also for promoting broader access to these therapies through lower prices to consumers.\n\nTraditional manufacturing approaches for recombinant antibodies often require substantial capital investment, with many companies building large-scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors to meet growing demand <Paper corpusId=\"43129756\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. These facilities represent significant financial commitments, yet the industry has experienced a paradoxical development: despite growing demand, there has been an emergence of excess manufacturing capacity <Paper corpusId=\"25001402\" paperTitle=\"(Kelley, 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This surplus resulted from the parallel efforts of building large bulk manufacturing plants while simultaneously achieving dramatic improvements in cell culture processes and titers. This combination has led to a marked reduction in production costs, potentially allowing production expenses to become a relatively small fraction of the sales price for future products <Paper corpusId=\"25001402\" paperTitle=\"(Kelley, 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor manufacturers seeking to increase capacity, two primary strategies have emerged: scaling out by building additional manufacturing facilities or intensifying production in existing plants <Paper corpusId=\"215407197\" paperTitle=\"(Stepper et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Both approaches require substantial investments that must be balanced against costs and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment <Paper corpusId=\"215407197\" paperTitle=\"(Stepper et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. For companies with established facilities, a prudent approach involves implementing intensification strategies that debottleneck production chains using available capacities and can be integrated into existing infrastructure <Paper corpusId=\"215407197\" paperTitle=\"(Stepper et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"82677659\" paperTitle=\"(Kloth et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe transition toward continuous processing offers significant economic advantages, though implementation challenges remain. Economic analyses indicate that continuous manufacturing coupled with continuous chromatography systems can reduce costs substantially compared to conventional batch processing. However, fully continuous production processes may be difficult to implement in existing fed-batch facilities due to open technical and regulatory questions, including higher complexity and increased media requirements <Paper corpusId=\"215407197\" paperTitle=\"(Stepper et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"30520425\" paperTitle=\"(Langer, 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. The adoption of newer manufacturing technologies is sometimes slowed by concerns associated with cost and scale-up challenges <Paper corpusId=\"10327770\" paperTitle=\"(Gupta et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor downstream processing, current chromatography and filtration technologies are not considered limiting factors up to the 10-ton scale <Paper corpusId=\"33331820\" paperTitle=\"(Reichert et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Long-term advances in techniques such as expanded bed adsorption, simultaneous multi-column chromatography systems, and new resins for protein purification offer potential benefits including increased plant throughput, improved process productivity, enhanced facility utilization, and ultimately a reduction in cost of goods (COG) <Paper corpusId=\"33331820\" paperTitle=\"(Reichert et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe economic considerations for recombinant antibody production vary significantly by application. In diagnostic settings, there is particular pressure for less expensive rapid tests, ideally costing less than $1 <Paper corpusId=\"237387732\" paperTitle=\"(Huleani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This drives interest in bacterial expression systems like Escherichia coli for cost-effective production of antibody fragments used in diagnostics, though these systems face their own scaling and production challenges <Paper corpusId=\"237387732\" paperTitle=\"(Huleani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCurrent inefficiencies in manufacturing processes impact not only production economics but also affect product quality and time-to-market <Paper corpusId=\"277649345\" paperTitle=\"(Ranbhor, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The industry requires innovative solutions that optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance <Paper corpusId=\"277649345\" paperTitle=\"(Ranbhor, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232482243\" paperTitle=\"(Mahal et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels."

                            "Increasing market demands for monoclonal antibody therapeutics and the pressure for cost-reduction in their production [4,(Farid, 2007) have led to new manufacturing approaches and improved facility utilization strategies e.g., continuous production (Warikoo et al., 2012)(Pollock et al., 2013). For implementation of upcoming process intensification technologies, pharmaceutical companies can aim for scale out by building additional manufacturing capacities or for intensification in existing pharmaceutical production plants. Both strategies require substantial investments and the changes have to be balanced against cost and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment. In the case of fully continuous production processes, an implementation in existing fed-batch facilities is often impossible due to open technical and regulatory questions such as higher complexity and increased media amounts (Pollock et al., 2013)[8](Langer, 2014). A smart step for the development and maintenance of marketable antibody portfolios is to search for intensification strategies, which debottleneck production chains using available capacities whenever possible and which are implementable in existing facilities, such as N \u2212 1 perfusion (Kloth et al., 2010)."

                            "B atch processing has long been the predominant bioprocessing paradigm, both upand downstream. Bioprocessing f luids are processed incrementally, piped as a bolus or transferred via vessels from one process and piece of equipment to the next. This continues to work well, including a number of technological advances resulting in improvements that continue to make bioprocessing more efficient. Upstream and overall process yields are essentially doubling about every five years, with this largely driven by improved cell lines, expression systems and genetic engineering, culture media, and equipment. Among the technologies now gaining increasing adoption and market share for biopharmaceutical manufacture is continuous (bio) processing, with perfusion currently the leading technology, in terms of adoption. The use of incremental, one-step-at-a-time, classic batch processing in biopharmaceutical manufacture is different than most other major products manufacturing and high-tech industries, where processing is generally more continuous. In this context, the move toward more continuous processing in manufacturing is a common characteristic of industries starting to reach maturity. Continuous processing is exemplified by assembly lines, and petroleum refining with processing involving a rather continuous flow of the material being manufactured from one unit operation to the next. Continuous processing generally follows and eventually replaces incremental manufacturing. Continuous processing generally requires more process knowledge, equipment and technological advances than incremental manufacturing. Successful adoption of continuous processing by any industry requires each of the component processes involved to be more integrated, at least with the next process. Continuous processing requires a sufficient critical mass of technological competencies and available equipment capable of supporting process integration. For example, implementing continuous bioprocessing, such as upstream perfusion, is not practical if the next and following steps are unable to handle this output. This article reviews and details some of the key advances and trends in the bioprocessing industry that have emerged which are creating greater adoption and potential for continuous processing as the industry matures. We evaluate aspects of continuous processing, exemplified by perfusion, and the adoption of these technologies by the biopharmaceutical manufacturing (bioprocessing) industry."

                            "This article presents a systematic approach to evaluate the business case for continuous processing that captures trade\u2010offs between manufacturing and development costs for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A decisional tool was built that integrated cost of goods (COG) with the cost of development models and new equipment sizing equations tailored to batch, hybrid, and end\u2010to\u2010end continuous processes. The COG analysis predicted that single\u2010use continuous facilities (sized using a dedicated downstream processing train per bioreactor) offer more significant commercial COG savings over stainless steel batch facilities at annual demands of 100\u2013500\u2009kg (~35%), compared to tonnage demands of 1\u20133 tons (~\u00b110%) that required multiple parallel continuous trains. Single\u2010use batch facilities were found to compete with continuous options on COG only at 100\u2009kg/year. For the scenarios where batch and continuous facilities offered similar COG, the analysis identified the windows of operation required to reach different COG savings with thresholds for the perfusion rate, volumetric productivity, and media cost. When considering the project lifecycle cost, the analysis indicated that while end\u2010to\u2010end continuous facilities may struggle to compete on development costs, they become more cost\u2010effective than stainless steel batch facilities when considering the total out\u2010of\u2010pocket cost across both drug development and commercial activities."

This comprehensive approach will lay \"a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes\" with development rapidly progressing \"in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality\" <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe industry appears to be undergoing a gradual but inevitable shift from batch processing to continuous production methodologies.

Traditional fed-batch manufacturing will struggle to meet future demands without massive capital investments in new facilities, making continuous processing an attractive alternative for companies seeking to expand production capacity.\n\nInnovation in manufacturing technologies presents opportunities beyond traditional monoclonal antibody production. The emergence of novel drug classes such as recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins\u2014exemplified by GIGA-2050, a mixture of over 10,000 different antibodies\u2014demonstrates that existing manufacturing infrastructure can be repurposed for producing complex antibody cocktails.

Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies (Frandsen et al., 2011). Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (Robak et al., 2012) but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies",
                            "Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters (Jesus et al., 2011). Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses."

Despite the current proofs of concept and successful introduction of new techniques in mAb processes, there may be unforeseen challenges when extending flexible manufacturing strategies to other biologics."
