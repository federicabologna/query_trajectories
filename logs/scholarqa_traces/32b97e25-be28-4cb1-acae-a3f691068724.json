One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat \u2018blind\u2019 approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this study is comparing ultrasound-guided vs palpation-guided conservative breast surgery in obtaining tumor-free resection margins. Methods: This study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial where patients with early breast cancer (T1-T2) and eligible for breast conserving surgery are randomly assigned (1:1) into two arms. Arm A: included the patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided breast conserving surgery. Arm B: included the patients who will undergo the conventional palpation-guided breast conserving surgery. Results: Overall, 142 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery were enrolled: 71 were allocated to the Ultrasound-guided (US) group (Arm A) and 71 to the Palpation-guided (PG) group (Arm B). Patient and tumor characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Age, Body mass index, tumor laterality, tumor location and tumor stage were comparable in both groups and statistically insignificant. Despite that the final tumor size was comparable between both groups, IOUS significantly reduced the main specimen volume and the least negative margin width (p<0.001). The median operative time was significantly longer in the US group bey around 27 min than in the PG group and this was statistically significant in favor of the PG surgery (p<0.001). The involved resection margin rate was significantly higher in the PG group and thus the need for reoperation (p<0.001). Conclusion: IOUS is the only method allowing a true real-time visualization and continuous control of resection margins during all phases of BCS. In our single-institution study, IOUS demonstrated clear superiority over palpation-guided surgery in both oncological and surgical outcomes except for the operative time (smaller excision volume yet, with optimum resection margins). IOUs provides much better tumor localization in small breasts with dense fibroadenosis. Since all the other available localization techniques (including palpation) limit the surgeon\u2019s visual guidance during BCS, IOUS could be regarded as one of the most significant modern technological innovations in the field of breast cancer surgery, restoring sight to the breast surgeon. Our findings strongly suggests that the integration of IOUS in breast conserving surgery could be regarded as a highly beneficial surgical approach.",

Accurate preoperative lesion localization is mandatory to obtain adequate oncological and cosmetic results. Image guidance assures the precision requested for this purpose. This review provides a summary of all techniques currently available, ranging from the classic wire positioning to the newer magnetic seed localization. We describe the procedures and equipment necessary for each method, outlining the advantages and disadvantages, with a focus on the cost-effective preoperative skin tattoo technique performed at our centre. Breast surgeons and radiologists have to consider ongoing technological developments in order to assess the best localization method for each individual patient and clinical setting.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women [1].

            "abstract": "Purpose Margin status is one of the most important predictors of local recurrence after breast conserving surgery (BCS). Intraoperative ultrasound guidance (IOUS) has the potential to improve surgical accuracy for breast cancer. The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of IOUS in breast cancer surgery and to compare the margin status to that of the more traditional Guide wire localization (GWL) or palpation-guidance. Methods We searched the database of PubMed for prospective and retrospective studies about the impact of IOUS on margin status of breast cancer, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results Of the 13 studies included, 8 were eligible for the impact of IOUS on margin status of non-palpable breast cancers, 4 were eligible for palpable breast cancers, and 1 was for both non-palpable and palpable breast cancers. The rate of negative margins of breast cancers in IOUS group was significantly higher than that in control group without IOUS (risk ratio (RR) \u200a=\u200a1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u200a=\u200a1.18\u20131.59 from 7 prospective studies, odds ratio (OR) \u200a=\u200a2.75, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.66\u20134.55 from 4 retrospective studies). For non-palpable breast cancers, IOUS-guidance enabled a significantly higher rate of negative margins than that of GWL-guidance (RR \u200a=\u200a1.26, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.09\u20131.46 from 6 prospective studies; OR \u200a=\u200a1.45, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a0.86\u20132.43 from 2 retrospective studies). For palpable breast cancers, relative to control group without IOUS, the RR for IOUS associated negative margins was 2.36 (95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.26\u20134.43) from 2 prospective studies, the OR was 2.71 (95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.25\u20135.87) from 2 retrospective studies. Conclusion This study strongly suggests that IOUS is an accurate method for localization of non-palpable and palpable breast cancers. It is an efficient method of obtaining high proportion of negative margins and optimum resection volumes in patients undergoing BCS.",

As the improvements in imaging techniques, the increased awareness of patients and widespread screening mammography, the number of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer has increased during the past decades [2]. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) plus adjuvant radiotherapy has become the alternative treatment to mastectomy for early stage breast cancer because of equivalent survival [3,4]. It is well known that obtaining negative surgical margins during BCS procedures is considered to be critically important in decreasing recurrence rates [5,6]. \n\nThe current focus is on improving the surgical accuracy of BCS, especially a higher rate of margin negative with smaller excision volume [7,8]. Various techniques have been used to localize breast lesions during BCS. Guide wire localization (GWL) is a standard technique for localization of non-palpable breast lesions [9]. However, there are several disadvantages of GWL, including a miss rate up to 20% of cases, and the possibility of wire transaction, dislocation or migration. Besides, the insertion of the wire could be uncomfortable for patients [10,11]. For palpable breast cancer, tumor excision is usually guided by preoperative diagnostic images and experience and tactile skills of the surgeons. However, palpation alone may be insufficient in differentiating between malignant tissues and surrounding tissues, especially in dense breasts. Palpation-guided surgery could lead high incidence of positive margins, ranging from 20% to 60% [12,13]. \n\nTherefore, a procedure with a higher rate of negative margins and less discomfort for the patient would be preferable. Examining the breasts by Ultrasound (US) was first described by Wild and Neal [14]. Its application has expanded from preoperative assessment and diagnostic guidance to intraoperative localization of breast cancers. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance (IOUS) was developed in 1988 [15]. It is an ultrasound probe that is used to localize the breast tumor in the operating theatre. IOUS may improve surgical accuracy of breast cancer excision. Since its introduction, several studies were published on IOUS focusing on margin status for either non-palpable or non-palpable breast cancers.",

Pan, Naping Wu, Hao Ding, Q. Ding, J. Dai, Li-jun Ling, Lin Chen, X. Zha, Xiaoan Liu, Wenbin Zhou, Shui Wang\n## Abstract\nPurpose Margin status is one of the most important predictors of local recurrence after breast conserving surgery (BCS). Intraoperative ultrasound guidance (IOUS) has the potential to improve surgical accuracy for breast cancer. The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of IOUS in breast cancer surgery and to compare the margin status to that of the more traditional Guide wire localization (GWL) or palpation-guidance. Methods We searched the database of PubMed for prospective and retrospective studies about the impact of IOUS on margin status of breast cancer, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results Of the 13 studies included, 8 were eligible for the impact of IOUS on margin status of non-palpable breast cancers, 4 were eligible for palpable breast cancers, and 1 was for both non-palpable and palpable breast cancers. The rate of negative margins of breast cancers in IOUS group was significantly higher than that in control group without IOUS (risk ratio (RR) \u200a=\u200a1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u200a=\u200a1.18\u20131.59 from 7 prospective studies, odds ratio (OR) \u200a=\u200a2.75, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.66\u20134.55 from 4 retrospective studies). For non-palpable breast cancers, IOUS-guidance enabled a significantly higher rate of negative margins than that of GWL-guidance (RR \u200a=\u200a1.26, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.09\u20131.46 from 6 prospective studies; OR \u200a=\u200a1.45, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a0.86\u20132.43 from 2 retrospective studies). For palpable breast cancers, relative to control group without IOUS, the RR for IOUS associated negative margins was 2.36 (95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.26\u20134.43) from 2 prospective studies, the OR was 2.71 (95% CI \u200a=\u200a1.25\u20135.87) from 2 retrospective studies. Conclusion This study strongly suggests that IOUS is an accurate method for localization of non-palpable and palpable breast cancers. It is an efficient method of obtaining high proportion of negative margins and optimum resection volumes in patients undergoing BCS.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the world [1]. As the improvements in imaging techniques, the increased awareness of patients and widespread screening mammography, the number of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer has increased during the past decades [2]. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) plus adjuvant radiotherapy has become the alternative treatment to mastectomy for early stage breast cancer because of equivalent survival [3,4]. It is well known that obtaining negative surgical margins during BCS procedures is considered to be critically important in decreasing recurrence rates [5,6]. \n\nThe current focus is on improving the surgical accuracy of BCS, especially a higher rate of margin negative with smaller excision volume [7,8]. Various techniques have been used to localize breast lesions during BCS. Guide wire localization (GWL) is a standard technique for localization of non-palpable breast lesions [9]. However, there are several disadvantages of GWL, including a miss rate up to 20% of cases, and the possibility of wire transaction, dislocation or migration. Besides, the insertion of the wire could be uncomfortable for patients [10,11]. For palpable breast cancer, tumor excision is usually guided by preoperative diagnostic images and experience and tactile skills of the surgeons. However, palpation alone may be insufficient in differentiating between malignant tissues and surrounding tissues, especially in dense breasts. Palpation-guided surgery could lead high incidence of positive margins, ranging from 20% to 60% [12,13]. \n\nTherefore, a procedure with a higher rate of negative margins and less discomfort for the patient would be preferable. Examining the breasts by Ultrasound (US) was first described by Wild and Neal [14]. Its application has expanded from preoperative assessment and diagnostic guidance to intraoperative localization of breast cancers. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance (IOUS) was developed in 1988 [15]. It is an ultrasound probe that is used to localize the breast tumor in the operating theatre. IOUS may improve surgical accuracy of breast cancer excision. Since its introduction, several studies were published on IOUS focusing on margin status for either non-palpable or non-palpable breast cancers.",

At the same time, the continuous development of diagnostic techniques necessitates continuous updating, due to their importance in tumoral staging and in the prediction of the response to treatment, as well as in surgical planning. With our review, we sought to discuss the strengths of the various imaging modalities; in particular, the role of magnetic resonance imaging, which is still the center of scientific debate in this setting. Moreover, we analyzed the evolution of surgical approaches to breast cancer in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Abstract Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) today represents a cornerstone in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer and highly chemo-sensitive tumors at early stages, increasing the possibilities of performing more conservative treatments and improving long term outcomes. Imaging has a fundamental role in the staging and prediction of the response to NACT, thus aiding surgical planning and avoiding overtreatment. In this review, we first examine and compare the role of conventional and advanced imaging techniques in preoperative T Staging after NACT and in the evaluation of lymph node involvement. In the second part, we analyze the different surgical approaches, discussing the role of axillary surgery, as well as the possibility of non-operative management after-NACT, which has been the subject of recent trials. Finally, we focus on emerging techniques that will change the diagnostic assessment of breast cancer in the near future.",

In a prospective observational cohort study, Karalik et al [13] undertook BCS guided by either ultrasound (n = 84) or palpation (n = 80) amongst two groups of women matched for demographic and tumour characteristics. \n\nUse of IOUS reduced the rate of re-excision from 17% for palpation-guided lumpectomy to only 6% with IOUS. (p = 0.03). Moreover, the volume of tissue resected in the palpation-guided group was significantly higher despite comparable tumour size (p = 0.048) and equivalent cosmetic outcomes. \n\nThe COBALT study is a prospective multicentre trial which addressed the hypothesis that use of IOUS for wide local excision of palpable breast cancers could potentially spare healthy tissue and improve both surgical margin status and cosmesis. The trial was conducted in the Netherlands, but accrued a relatively small number of patients in relation to the number of centres and participating surgeons. Notwithstanding this comment, the trial had 80% power to detect an 18% reduction in the re-excision rates. A total of 134 patients with palpable early stage primary invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-1) were randomised to either ultrasound-guided surgery (USS) or palpation-guided surgery (PGS). Some patients had invasive tumour associated with DCIS, which influenced rates of margin positivity. Nonetheless, use of ultrasound significantly increased the negative margin rate from 83% (PGS) to 94% (USS) (p = 0.03). Moreover, specimen volumes at first excision were significantly lower for the USS group compared with the PGS group (p = 0.048). The trial contained a quality-of-life sub-study and also examined cosmetic outcomes [14]. \n\nAnother familiar imaging modality is MRI which can be used for specimen radiography; however, this methodology within the context of surgical excision specimens is impractical, time consuming and unlikely to be cost-effective in any managed healthcare system.",

                    "text": "The remarkable evolution of breast cancer surgery from the radical mastectomy advocated by William Halsted to cosmetically appealing breast conservation has been championed by women and pioneering surgeons, 1 and the safety and benefits of this approach have ultimately been confirmed through high-level scientific evidence. Randomized trials and subsequent experience with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) have clearly established its efficacy, with a low, long-term risk of local (in-breast) recurrence, typically 0.5% to 1% per year. The increasing adoption of performing preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in women newly diagnosed with early stage (stage I and II) breast cancer, for the purpose of identifying additional (occult) foci of disease within the affected breast, has been based on assumptions that MRI's detection capability in this setting will improve surgical treatment (and, hence, outcomes) in the absence of evidence of incremental clinical benefit. These assumptions, which are further discussed in relation to available evidence, are that: (1) preoperative MRI will improve surgical planning (or precision), thus leading to a reduction in re-excision surgery, and (2) MRI will reduce in-breast recurrences by guiding surgical intervention for MRI-detected additional disease. \n\nEmerging data show that this approach to local staging of the breast leads to more women being treated with mastectomy without improvement in surgical outcomes or prognosis. Thus, it is timely and imperative to consider both current evidence and a way forward in determining the role of preoperative MRI. We review the data on breast MRI in women newly affected by breast cancer, highlighting the evidence on its potential benefit and associated harm, and discuss implications for management of women with early stage disease. We systematically discuss each of the key issues relevant to addressing the clinical question raised in the title of our article, based on summaries of published data, complemented by our perspectives on the evidence in the context of contemporary standards of care in breast cancer.",

CA Cancer J Clin 2009;59:290\u2013302. \u00a9 2009 American Cancer Society, Inc.\n## Introduction\nThe remarkable evolution of breast cancer surgery from the radical mastectomy advocated by William Halsted to cosmetically appealing breast conservation has been championed by women and pioneering surgeons, 1 and the safety and benefits of this approach have ultimately been confirmed through high-level scientific evidence. Randomized trials and subsequent experience with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) have clearly established its efficacy, with a low, long-term risk of local (in-breast) recurrence, typically 0.5% to 1% per year. The increasing adoption of performing preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in women newly diagnosed with early stage (stage I and II) breast cancer, for the purpose of identifying additional (occult) foci of disease within the affected breast, has been based on assumptions that MRI's detection capability in this setting will improve surgical treatment (and, hence, outcomes) in the absence of evidence of incremental clinical benefit. These assumptions, which are further discussed in relation to available evidence, are that: (1) preoperative MRI will improve surgical planning (or precision), thus leading to a reduction in re-excision surgery, and (2) MRI will reduce in-breast recurrences by guiding surgical intervention for MRI-detected additional disease. \n\nEmerging data show that this approach to local staging of the breast leads to more women being treated with mastectomy without improvement in surgical outcomes or prognosis. Thus, it is timely and imperative to consider both current evidence and a way forward in determining the role of preoperative MRI. We review the data on breast MRI in women newly affected by breast cancer, highlighting the evidence on its potential benefit and associated harm, and discuss implications for management of women with early stage disease. We systematically discuss each of the key issues relevant to addressing the clinical question raised in the title of our article, based on summaries of published data, complemented by our perspectives on the evidence in the context of contemporary standards of care in breast cancer.",

For this reason, we have developed a 3D-printed personalised breast surgery guide (BSG) assisted with supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image 3D reconstruction technology, capable of mapping the tumour area identified on MRI onto the breast directly using dual positioning based on the manubrium and nipple. In addition, the BSG allows the colour dye to be injected into the breast to mark the tumour region to be removed, yielding more accurate intraoperative resection and satisfactory cosmetic outcomes. The device has been applied to 14 patients from January 2018 to July 2023, with two positive margins revealed by the intraoperative biopsy. This study showed that the BSG-based method could facilitate precise tumour resection of BCS by accurately localising tumour extent and margin, promoting the clinical efficacy in patients with breast cancer as well as simplifying the surgical process.",

                    "text": "Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most diagnosed cancer worldwide (approximately 2.3 million in 2020), accounting for 24.5% of all cancer cases [1]. For early breast cancer, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has become the preferred surgical treatment strategy, while locally advanced breast cancer is treated generally via BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) that can downstage the tumour as well as reduce tumour size [2,3]. However, NACT can cause the original tumour to shrink or scatter remarkably, imposing a significant challenge on the preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent, thus leading to intraoperative incomplete or excessive tumour resection [4][5][6]. Inadequate resection increases the probability of recurrence and reoperation, whilst excessive resection deteriorates cosmetic outcomes. Consequently, accurate preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent and margin after the treatment of NACT is of great importance to patients eligible to undergo BCS, particularly those with locally advanced breast cancers. \n\nOf many imaging modalities commonly employed to determine tumour extent and location, such as computed tomography, mammography, sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI is considered more suitable for identifying residual tumours after NACT due to its higher accuracy [5,7,8]. A vital difficulty of BCS is how to accurately map the digitalised tumour information acquired from the aforementioned medical imaging methods onto the patient's breast. To address this issue, various surgical guidance devices, including wire-guided localisation, clip marker insertion and radio-guided localisation, have been developed for aiding preoperative breast localisation and surgical excision [9][10][11][12]. However, each localisation technique above possesses its own clinical limitations due to intrinsic disadvantages in aspects of localisation accuracy, procedural complexity, invasiveness to the patient and safety, and a detailed review is available from Corsi et al. [13][14][15].",

For this reason, we have developed a 3D-printed personalised breast surgery guide (BSG) assisted with supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image 3D reconstruction technology, capable of mapping the tumour area identified on MRI onto the breast directly using dual positioning based on the manubrium and nipple. In addition, the BSG allows the colour dye to be injected into the breast to mark the tumour region to be removed, yielding more accurate intraoperative resection and satisfactory cosmetic outcomes. The device has been applied to 14 patients from January 2018 to July 2023, with two positive margins revealed by the intraoperative biopsy. This study showed that the BSG-based method could facilitate precise tumour resection of BCS by accurately localising tumour extent and margin, promoting the clinical efficacy in patients with breast cancer as well as simplifying the surgical process.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most diagnosed cancer worldwide (approximately 2.3 million in 2020), accounting for 24.5% of all cancer cases [1]. For early breast cancer, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has become the preferred surgical treatment strategy, while locally advanced breast cancer is treated generally via BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) that can downstage the tumour as well as reduce tumour size [2,3]. However, NACT can cause the original tumour to shrink or scatter remarkably, imposing a significant challenge on the preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent, thus leading to intraoperative incomplete or excessive tumour resection [4][5][6]. Inadequate resection increases the probability of recurrence and reoperation, whilst excessive resection deteriorates cosmetic outcomes. Consequently, accurate preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent and margin after the treatment of NACT is of great importance to patients eligible to undergo BCS, particularly those with locally advanced breast cancers. \n\nOf many imaging modalities commonly employed to determine tumour extent and location, such as computed tomography, mammography, sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI is considered more suitable for identifying residual tumours after NACT due to its higher accuracy [5,7,8]. A vital difficulty of BCS is how to accurately map the digitalised tumour information acquired from the aforementioned medical imaging methods onto the patient's breast. To address this issue, various surgical guidance devices, including wire-guided localisation, clip marker insertion and radio-guided localisation, have been developed for aiding preoperative breast localisation and surgical excision [9][10][11][12]. However, each localisation technique above possesses its own clinical limitations due to intrinsic disadvantages in aspects of localisation accuracy, procedural complexity, invasiveness to the patient and safety, and a detailed review is available from Corsi et al. [13][14][15].",

            "abstract": "Breast cancer is most common cancer among women world-wide and can be treated if diagnosed at early-stage. Fluorescence (FL) techniques have a considerable impact in tumor detection as FL is highly sensitive to biochemical and biophysical structure of the tissues, providing novel techniques for early and noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. Due to high sensitivity of FL, it can be used in early-stage breast cancer detection. Fluorescence-guided-surgery (FGS) using exogenous agent in breast cancer is a well-known method, which locates tumor and margins during intra-operative procedure. FL-spectroscopy and FL-imaging has shown the potentiality in FGS of breast cancer independently. Combination of these two modalities in a single system improves the success rate of FGS which can give tumor free tissues. The goal of the current study is to analyze and classify the early-stage breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma) and normal tissue. For that, we combine FL-imaging and FL-spectroscopy in a single smartphone-based point-of-care devices and recorded data during intra-operative procedure.

Mehta\n## Abstract\nBreast cancer is most common cancer among women world-wide and can be treated if diagnosed at early-stage. Fluorescence (FL) techniques have a considerable impact in tumor detection as FL is highly sensitive to biochemical and biophysical structure of the tissues, providing novel techniques for early and noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. Due to high sensitivity of FL, it can be used in early-stage breast cancer detection. Fluorescence-guided-surgery (FGS) using exogenous agent in breast cancer is a well-known method, which locates tumor and margins during intra-operative procedure. FL-spectroscopy and FL-imaging has shown the potentiality in FGS of breast cancer independently. Combination of these two modalities in a single system improves the success rate of FGS which can give tumor free tissues. The goal of the current study is to analyze and classify the early-stage breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma) and normal tissue. For that, we combine FL-imaging and FL-spectroscopy in a single smartphone-based point-of-care devices and recorded data during intra-operative procedure. A total 21 patients of invasive ductal carcinoma and fibroadenoma are included in this study. Total 65 FL-spectra are recorded during intra-operative procedure which are further used in support vector machine (SVM) based classification of fibroadenoma, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and normal tissue. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall diagnostic accuracy (total efficiency) is 78.6 %, 90%, 91.6%, 75%, 95%, respectively. Additionally, we observed a red shift in case of IDC and fibroadenoma from normal tissue, which is 5.22\u00b11.77 nm, and 4.96\u00b12.61 nm, respectively.\n",

            "abstract": "Background Re-excision rates following breast conserving surgery (BCS) remain as high as ~\u200935%, with positive margins detected during follow-up histopathology. Additional breast cancer resection surgery is not only taxing on the patient and health care system, but also delays adjuvant therapies, increasing morbidity and reducing the likelihood of a positive outcome. The ability to precisely resect and visualize tumor margins in real time within the surgical theater would greatly benefit patients, surgeons and the health care system. Current tumor margin assessment technologies utilized during BCS involve relatively lengthy and labor-intensive protocols, which impede the surgical work flow. Methods In previous work, we have developed and validated a fluorescence imaging method termed dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI) to accurately detect benign and malignant tissue with direct correlation to the targeted biomarker expression levels intraoperatively. The DDSI method is currently on par with touch prep cytology in execution time (~\u200915-min). In this study, the main goal was to shorten the DDSI protocol by decreasing tissue blocking and washing times to optimize the DDSI protocol to <\u200910-min whilst maintaining robust benign and malignant tissue differentiation. Results We evaluated the utility of the shortened DDSI staining methodology using xenografts grown from cell lines with varied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression levels, comparing accuracy through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses across varied tissue blocking and washing times. An optimized 8-min DDSI methodology was developed for future clinical translation. Conclusions Successful completion of this work resulted in substantial shortening of the DDSI methodology for use in the operating room, that provided robust, highly receptor specific, sensitive diagnostic capabilities between benign and malignant tissues.",

Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of early stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant therapy [2,3]. The success of BCS, however, is reliant upon negative or clear margins, with positive margin status thought to be a primary indicator of local breast cancer recurrence [4]. BCS cases with positive margin status as determined by histopathology necessitate follow-up surgery. Standard of care BCS procedures result in positive margins in up to 35% of patients [5], leading to re-excision, where higher positive margin rates are seen at centers where larger normal tissue borders around tumor are required. Additionally, in many BCS patients with adequate tumor margins, negative margins are achieved at the expense of excessive resection of healthy breast tissue with lumpectomy volumes up to 2.5x greater than the necessary resection volume [6]. Not only does follow up surgery delay adjuvant therapy, but it also leads to increased patient stress giving way to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality rates [7][8][9][10][11]. The implementation of intraoperative margin detection methodologies based on pathology techniques including touch prep cytology [12] and frozen section analysis (FSA) [13] have been successful in reducing re-excision rates. However, these aforementioned procedures not only increase surgical time and are dependent upon the presence of a pathologist, but they have also been found to contain significant variation in their sensitivity and specificity between studies [14,15]. Consequently, the majority of US hospitals have not adopted these pathology based techniques for intraoperative margin assessment during BCS, thus warranting a modality that is able to decrease re-excision rates in a rapid platform within the operating room (OR) [16]. \n\nFluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is an optical imaging modality that has become an attractive tool for intraoperative margin assessment due to its real time imaging capabilities.",

House, Marcus J. Kwon, Jasmin M. Schaefer, Connor W. Barth, Allison Solanki, S. Davis, Summer L. Gibbs\n## Abstract\nBackground Re-excision rates following breast conserving surgery (BCS) remain as high as ~\u200935%, with positive margins detected during follow-up histopathology. Additional breast cancer resection surgery is not only taxing on the patient and health care system, but also delays adjuvant therapies, increasing morbidity and reducing the likelihood of a positive outcome. The ability to precisely resect and visualize tumor margins in real time within the surgical theater would greatly benefit patients, surgeons and the health care system. Current tumor margin assessment technologies utilized during BCS involve relatively lengthy and labor-intensive protocols, which impede the surgical work flow. Methods In previous work, we have developed and validated a fluorescence imaging method termed dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI) to accurately detect benign and malignant tissue with direct correlation to the targeted biomarker expression levels intraoperatively. The DDSI method is currently on par with touch prep cytology in execution time (~\u200915-min). In this study, the main goal was to shorten the DDSI protocol by decreasing tissue blocking and washing times to optimize the DDSI protocol to <\u200910-min whilst maintaining robust benign and malignant tissue differentiation. Results We evaluated the utility of the shortened DDSI staining methodology using xenografts grown from cell lines with varied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression levels, comparing accuracy through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses across varied tissue blocking and washing times. An optimized 8-min DDSI methodology was developed for future clinical translation. Conclusions Successful completion of this work resulted in substantial shortening of the DDSI methodology for use in the operating room, that provided robust, highly receptor specific, sensitive diagnostic capabilities between benign and malignant tissues.\n## Background\nWith more than 284,000 expected new breast cancer diagnoses in 2021 alone, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths for women in the United States (US) making early, and precise, treatment imperative [1]. Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of early stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant therapy [2,3]. The success of BCS, however, is reliant upon negative or clear margins, with positive margin status thought to be a primary indicator of local breast cancer recurrence [4]. BCS cases with positive margin status as determined by histopathology necessitate follow-up surgery. Standard of care BCS procedures result in positive margins in up to 35% of patients [5], leading to re-excision, where higher positive margin rates are seen at centers where larger normal tissue borders around tumor are required. Additionally, in many BCS patients with adequate tumor margins, negative margins are achieved at the expense of excessive resection of healthy breast tissue with lumpectomy volumes up to 2.5x greater than the necessary resection volume [6]. Not only does follow up surgery delay adjuvant therapy, but it also leads to increased patient stress giving way to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality rates [7][8][9][10][11]. The implementation of intraoperative margin detection methodologies based on pathology techniques including touch prep cytology [12] and frozen section analysis (FSA) [13] have been successful in reducing re-excision rates. However, these aforementioned procedures not only increase surgical time and are dependent upon the presence of a pathologist, but they have also been found to contain significant variation in their sensitivity and specificity between studies [14,15]. Consequently, the majority of US hospitals have not adopted these pathology based techniques for intraoperative margin assessment during BCS, thus warranting a modality that is able to decrease re-excision rates in a rapid platform within the operating room (OR) [16]. \n\nFluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is an optical imaging modality that has become an attractive tool for intraoperative margin assessment due to its real time imaging capabilities.",

Gibbs\n## Abstract\nRe-excision rates following breast conserving surgery (BCS) remain as high as ~\u200935%, with positive margins detected during follow-up histopathology. Additional breast cancer resection surgery is not only taxing on the patient and health care system, but also delays adjuvant therapies, increasing morbidity and reducing the likelihood of a positive outcome. The ability to precisely resect and visualize tumor margins in real time within the surgical theater would greatly benefit patients, surgeons and the health care system. Current tumor margin assessment technologies utilized during BCS involve relatively lengthy and labor-intensive protocols, which impede the surgical work flow. In previous work, we have developed and validated a fluorescence imaging method termed dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI) to accurately detect benign and malignant tissue with direct correlation to the targeted biomarker expression levels intraoperatively. The DDSI method is currently on par with touch prep cytology in execution time (~\u200915-min). In this study, the main goal was to shorten the DDSI protocol by decreasing tissue blocking and washing times to optimize the DDSI protocol to <\u200910-min whilst maintaining robust benign and malignant tissue differentiation. We evaluated the utility of the shortened DDSI staining methodology using xenografts grown from cell lines with varied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression levels, comparing accuracy through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses across varied tissue blocking and washing times. An optimized 8-min DDSI methodology was developed for future clinical translation. Successful completion of this work resulted in substantial shortening of the DDSI methodology for use in the operating room, that provided robust, highly receptor specific, sensitive diagnostic capabilities between benign and malignant tissues.\n## Background\nWith more than 284,000 expected new breast cancer diagnoses in 2021 alone, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths for women in the United States (US) making early, and precise, treatment imperative [1]. Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of early stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant therapy [2,3]. The success of BCS, however, is reliant upon negative or clear margins, with positive margin status thought to be a primary indicator of local breast cancer recurrence [4]. BCS cases with positive margin status as determined by histopathology necessitate follow-up surgery. Standard of care BCS procedures result in positive margins in up to 35% of patients [5], leading to re-excision, where higher positive margin rates are seen at centers where larger normal tissue borders around tumor are required. Additionally, in many BCS patients with adequate tumor margins, negative margins are achieved at the expense of excessive resection of healthy breast tissue with lumpectomy volumes up to 2.5x greater than the necessary resection volume [6]. Not only does follow up surgery delay adjuvant therapy, but it also leads to increased patient stress giving way to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality rates [7][8][9][10][11]. The implementation of intraoperative margin detection methodologies based on pathology techniques including touch prep cytology [12] and frozen section analysis (FSA) [13] have been successful in reducing re-excision rates. However, these aforementioned procedures not only increase surgical time and are dependent upon the presence of a pathologist, but they have also been found to contain significant variation in their sensitivity and specificity between studies [14,15]. Consequently, the majority of US hospitals have not adopted these pathology based techniques for intraoperative margin assessment during BCS, thus warranting a modality that is able to decrease re-excision rates in a rapid platform within the operating room (OR) [16]. \n\nFluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is an optical imaging modality that has become an attractive tool for intraoperative margin assessment due to its real time imaging capabilities.",

In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

The other possibility is that the precursor-like lesion (e.g., atypical hyperplasia) which was captured in the histological section of the MFP specimen (Supplemental Figure S7) was left behind in the surgical bed. As PDX tumours can contain several precursor lesions such as atypical hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, pagetoid lobular carcinoma in situ, 60 it is possible that they can be a source of invasive/noninvasive breast cancer due to the characteristics of the PDX models. 61,62 Since we are aware that the complete surgical excision of the early stage of disease with negative margins is important from the clinical point of view, intraoperative imaging on the early stage of disease is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, given that only one mouse in the ICG-p28 group demonstrated tumour recurrence and that the volume of the recurred tumour was the smallest among the other groups, ICG-p28-guided surgery appears to assist well in precisely identifying tumour margins and to significantly reduce tumour recurrence rates. Overall, imageguided surgery with ICG-p28 in multiple subtypes of breast cancer (Figures 4,6) resulted in an average recurrent tumour volume of 300 mm 3 , whereas surgery with ICG alone or without interoperative imaging (PBS) resulted in average recurrent tumour volumes of 1188 mm 3 (P = 0.017, Friedman's test) and 1289 mm 3 (P = 0.032, Friedman's test), respectively. In addition, the tumour recurrence rate for the ICG-p28 groups was 8% (92% specificity, N = 2/24), while the tumour recurrence rates for the ICG and PBS groups were 33% (N = 8/24) and 29% (N = 7/24), respectively, (Figure 6e).",

Ryoo, Samer A. Naffouje, Sunam Mander, K. Christov, Jing Wang, A. Green, A. Shilkaitis, T. K. Das Gupta, Tohru Yamada\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.\n\n## Discussion\nIf this is the case, additional approaches (e. g., image-guided surgery with ICG-p28 in combination with other therapeutic approaches) need to be further considered to manage these microlesions. The other possibility is that the precursor-like lesion (e.g., atypical hyperplasia) which was captured in the histological section of the MFP specimen (Supplemental Figure S7) was left behind in the surgical bed. As PDX tumours can contain several precursor lesions such as atypical hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, pagetoid lobular carcinoma in situ, 60 it is possible that they can be a source of invasive/noninvasive breast cancer due to the characteristics of the PDX models. 61,62 Since we are aware that the complete surgical excision of the early stage of disease with negative margins is important from the clinical point of view, intraoperative imaging on the early stage of disease is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, given that only one mouse in the ICG-p28 group demonstrated tumour recurrence and that the volume of the recurred tumour was the smallest among the other groups, ICG-p28-guided surgery appears to assist well in precisely identifying tumour margins and to significantly reduce tumour recurrence rates. Overall, imageguided surgery with ICG-p28 in multiple subtypes of breast cancer (Figures 4,6) resulted in an average recurrent tumour volume of 300 mm 3 , whereas surgery with ICG alone or without interoperative imaging (PBS) resulted in average recurrent tumour volumes of 1188 mm 3 (P = 0.017, Friedman's test) and 1289 mm 3 (P = 0.032, Friedman's test), respectively. In addition, the tumour recurrence rate for the ICG-p28 groups was 8% (92% specificity, N = 2/24), while the tumour recurrence rates for the ICG and PBS groups were 33% (N = 8/24) and 29% (N = 7/24), respectively, (Figure 6e).",

The focus is now on opportunities to de-escalation treatment to minimize morbidity and maximize patients\u2019 quality of life. Recently, percutaneous minimally invasive ablative techniques have been explored. Early trials in small population of patients demonstrated cryoablation to be effective, safe, and well-tolerated in an outpatient setting. Subsequent surgical resection was performed and the ablation success rate was the highest if the tumor was less than 1.5 cm and with < 25% ductal carcinoma in situ component. ACOSOG Alliance Z1072, a phase II trial with curative intent, demonstrated 100% ablation in all tumors smaller than 1 cm and 92% success in lesions without multifocal disease and less than 2 cm in size. There are ongoing prospective clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of cryoablation without surgical excision for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. FROST (Freezing Instead of Removal Of Small Tumors) started in 2016 is ongoing, ICE3 (Cryoablation of Low Risk Small Breast Cancer) started in 2014 just released 5 years results, and COOL-IT: Cryoablation vs Lumpectomy in T1 Breast Cancers is also ongoing. These prospective trials will expand our knowledge on the safety and value of cryoablation. It is crucial to understand the indications, technical nuances, and distinctive imaging findings for cryoablation as it has potential to revolutionize standard surgical practice.",

Takabe\n## Abstract\nBreast cancer is one of the most common malignancies, affecting millions of people worldwide annually. The treatment paradigm for early-stage breast cancer is in flux. The focus is now on opportunities to de-escalation treatment to minimize morbidity and maximize patients\u2019 quality of life. Recently, percutaneous minimally invasive ablative techniques have been explored. Early trials in small population of patients demonstrated cryoablation to be effective, safe, and well-tolerated in an outpatient setting. Subsequent surgical resection was performed and the ablation success rate was the highest if the tumor was less than 1.5 cm and with < 25% ductal carcinoma in situ component. ACOSOG Alliance Z1072, a phase II trial with curative intent, demonstrated 100% ablation in all tumors smaller than 1 cm and 92% success in lesions without multifocal disease and less than 2 cm in size. There are ongoing prospective clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of cryoablation without surgical excision for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. FROST (Freezing Instead of Removal Of Small Tumors) started in 2016 is ongoing, ICE3 (Cryoablation of Low Risk Small Breast Cancer) started in 2014 just released 5 years results, and COOL-IT: Cryoablation vs Lumpectomy in T1 Breast Cancers is also ongoing. These prospective trials will expand our knowledge on the safety and value of cryoablation. It is crucial to understand the indications, technical nuances, and distinctive imaging findings for cryoablation as it has potential to revolutionize standard surgical practice.\n## Introduction\nSurgical treatment for breast cancer continues to transform with de-escalation as the driving force [1]. Currently, breastconserving surgery is the standard of care for early-stage breast cancer with no significant difference in survival rates compared to mastectomy [2].

            "abstract": "AbstractThe objective of this study was to assess whether preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with conventional breast imaging techniques decreases the rates of margin involvement and reexcision.Data on patients who underwent surgery for primary operable breast cancer were obtained from the Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) breast cancer database. The rate of surgical margin involvement and the rate of reoperation were compared between patients who underwent conventional breast imaging modalities (Group A: mammography and sonography) and those who received breast MRI in addition to conventional imaging (Group B: mammography, sonography, and MRI).A total of 1468 patients were enrolled in this study. Among the 733 patients in Group A, 377 (51.4%) received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and 356 (48.6%) received mastectomy. Among the 735 patients in Group B, 348 (47.3%) received BCS and 387 (52.7%) received mastectomy. There were no significant differences in operative method between patients who received conventional imaging alone and those that received MRI and conventional imaging (P\u200a=\u200a0.13). The rate of detection of pathological multifocal/multicentric breast cancer was markedly higher in patients who received preoperative MRI than in those who underwent conventional imaging alone (14.3% vs 8.6%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The overall rate of surgical margin involvement was significantly lower in patients who received MRI (5.0%) than in those who received conventional imaging alone (9.0%) (P\u200a<\u200a0.01). However, a significant reduction in rate of surgical margin positivity was only observed in patients who received BCS (Group A, 14.6%; Group B, 6.6%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The overall BCS reoperation rates were 11.7% in the conventional imaging group and 3.2% in the combined MRI group (P\u200a<\u200a0.01). There were no significant differences in rate of residual cancer in specimens obtained during reoperation between the 2 preoperative imaging groups (Group A, 50%; Group B, 81.8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.09). In multivariate analysis, multifocal/multicentric breast cancer (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2.38, P\u200a=\u200a0.02) and without MRI use (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2.35, P\u200a<\u200a0.01) were the major predisposing factors to margin involvement in patients received BCS.Preoperative breast MRI combined with conventional breast imaging results in a lower rate of surgical margin involvement and reoperations in patients who receive BCS.",

                    "text": "B reast cancer treatment involves multidisciplinary and multi- modality management, and surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for early stage breast cancer. 1,2 The goal of surgical resection is to remove the tumor with adequate safe margins. 3,4  number of studies have shown that positive margins are associated with higher rates of local recurrence after BCS (lumpectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy), [5][6][7] thereby mandating reoperation. 8,9 A number of ways to optimize margin clearance have been proposed, including intraoperative surgical techniques, such as radioguided surgery and ultrasound-guided resection, intraoperative pathology assessment techniques, and preoperative imaging. 10 ccurate preoperative assessment of tumor location and extension is important for adequate surgical planning. 11 MRI is increasingly being used in the preoperative evaluation of breast cancer [12][13][14][15] and has been reported to have value in estimating tumor size, 11,16 high sensitivity for detecting ipsilateral and contralateral occult breast lesions, [13][14][15]17 and therefore could be complementary to conventional breast imaging modalities such as mammography and sonography. \n\nSome studies have demonstrated that the high sensitivity of MRI for detecting cancer aids in the selection of patients for BCS [18][19][20] and increases the likelihood of obtaining negative margins during the first lumpectomy attempt, 21,22 reduce reexcision rates, [22][23][24] decreasing the rate of ipsilateral tumor recurrence, 25 and the development of new breast cancer on the contralateral side. 25 However, other studies have shown that breast MRI is not associated with improved margin status 12,24,[26][27][28] or a reduction in reoperation, [26][27][28][29][30] but instead is associated with treatment delay 12 and an increased rate of mastectomy. 12,25,27 -30 n this case-control comparative analysis, we evaluated whether combining breast MRI with conventional imaging techniques results in lower rates of margin involvement and reexcision.",

Lai, Chih-Jung Chen, Ying-Jen Lin, Shu-Ling Chen, Hwa-Koon Wu, Yu-Ting Wu, S. Kuo, Shou-Tung Chen, Dar-Ren Chen\n## Abstract\nAbstractThe objective of this study was to assess whether preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with conventional breast imaging techniques decreases the rates of margin involvement and reexcision.Data on patients who underwent surgery for primary operable breast cancer were obtained from the Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) breast cancer database. The rate of surgical margin involvement and the rate of reoperation were compared between patients who underwent conventional breast imaging modalities (Group A: mammography and sonography) and those who received breast MRI in addition to conventional imaging (Group B: mammography, sonography, and MRI).A total of 1468 patients were enrolled in this study. Among the 733 patients in Group A, 377 (51.4%) received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and 356 (48.6%) received mastectomy. Among the 735 patients in Group B, 348 (47.3%) received BCS and 387 (52.7%) received mastectomy. There were no significant differences in operative method between patients who received conventional imaging alone and those that received MRI and conventional imaging (P\u200a=\u200a0.13). The rate of detection of pathological multifocal/multicentric breast cancer was markedly higher in patients who received preoperative MRI than in those who underwent conventional imaging alone (14.3% vs 8.6%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The overall rate of surgical margin involvement was significantly lower in patients who received MRI (5.0%) than in those who received conventional imaging alone (9.0%) (P\u200a<\u200a0.01). However, a significant reduction in rate of surgical margin positivity was only observed in patients who received BCS (Group A, 14.6%; Group B, 6.6%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The overall BCS reoperation rates were 11.7% in the conventional imaging group and 3.2% in the combined MRI group (P\u200a<\u200a0.01). There were no significant differences in rate of residual cancer in specimens obtained during reoperation between the 2 preoperative imaging groups (Group A, 50%; Group B, 81.8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.09). In multivariate analysis, multifocal/multicentric breast cancer (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2.38, P\u200a=\u200a0.02) and without MRI use (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2.35, P\u200a<\u200a0.01) were the major predisposing factors to margin involvement in patients received BCS.Preoperative breast MRI combined with conventional breast imaging results in a lower rate of surgical margin involvement and reoperations in patients who receive BCS.\n## INTRODUCTION\nB reast cancer treatment involves multidisciplinary and multi- modality management, and surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for early stage breast cancer. 1,2 The goal of surgical resection is to remove the tumor with adequate safe margins. 3,4  number of studies have shown that positive margins are associated with higher rates of local recurrence after BCS (lumpectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy), [5][6][7] thereby mandating reoperation. 8,9 A number of ways to optimize margin clearance have been proposed, including intraoperative surgical techniques, such as radioguided surgery and ultrasound-guided resection, intraoperative pathology assessment techniques, and preoperative imaging. 10 ccurate preoperative assessment of tumor location and extension is important for adequate surgical planning. 11 MRI is increasingly being used in the preoperative evaluation of breast cancer [12][13][14][15] and has been reported to have value in estimating tumor size, 11,16 high sensitivity for detecting ipsilateral and contralateral occult breast lesions, [13][14][15]17 and therefore could be complementary to conventional breast imaging modalities such as mammography and sonography. \n\nSome studies have demonstrated that the high sensitivity of MRI for detecting cancer aids in the selection of patients for BCS [18][19][20] and increases the likelihood of obtaining negative margins during the first lumpectomy attempt, 21,22 reduce reexcision rates, [22][23][24] decreasing the rate of ipsilateral tumor recurrence, 25 and the development of new breast cancer on the contralateral side. 25 However, other studies have shown that breast MRI is not associated with improved margin status 12,24,[26][27][28] or a reduction in reoperation, [26][27][28][29][30] but instead is associated with treatment delay 12 and an increased rate of mastectomy. 12,25,27 -30 n this case-control comparative analysis, we evaluated whether combining breast MRI with conventional imaging techniques results in lower rates of margin involvement and reexcision.",

The early prediction of its responses is important for personalized treatment. This study aimed at using baseline shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound combined with clinical and pathological information to predict the clinical response to therapy in advanced breast cancer. Methods This retrospective study included 217 patients with advanced breast cancer who were treated in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from April 2020 to June 2022. The features of ultrasonic images were collected according to the Breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS), and the stiffness value was measured at the same time. The changes were measured according to the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST1.1) by MRI and clinical situation. The relevant indicators of clinical response were obtained through univariate analysis and incorporated into a logistic regression analysis to establish the prediction model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the prediction models. Results All patients were divided into a test set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. A total of 152 patients in the test set, with 41 patients (27.00%) in the non-responders group and 111 patients (73.00%) in the responders group, were finally included in this study. Among all unitary and combined mode models, the Pathology + B-mode + SWE model performed best, with the highest AUC of 0.808 (accuracy 72.37%, sensitivity 68.47%, specificity 82.93%, P<0.001). HER2+, Skin invasion, Post mammary space invasion, Myometrial invasion and Emax were the factors with a significant predictive value (P<0.05). 65 patients were used as an external validation set. There was no statistical difference in ROC between the test set and the validation set (P>0.05). Conclusion As the non-invasive imaging biomarkers, baseline SWE ultrasound combined with clinical and pathological information can be used to predict the clinical response to therapy in advanced breast cancer.",

                    "text": "Breast cancer has now surpassed lung cancer as the world's largest cancer, ranking first globally and fourth in China in the spectrum of cancer deaths in women (1,2). Advanced breast cancer (ABC), including locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), and metastatic breast cancer, which cannot undergo radical surgery at present, are related to the high incidence of metastasis and poor prognosis (3,4). Therefore, the main goal of its treatment is to delay the progress of the disease, prolong the survival time, and improve the quality of life of patients. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and salvage therapy for M1 stage breast cancer, instead of surgical resection at diagnosis, are recommended as the preferred treatment to ABC to provide more surgical opportunities and improve the survival rate according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (5). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of the curative effect is of particular significance. At present, the evaluation of clinical response is mainly carried out through pathological and clinical methods, that is, preoperative Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1) (6) and postoperative Miller-Payne (MP) Grading Criteria classification (7). In clinical application, the timing of surgery and intraoperative tumor resection volume are based on clinical response (8), which should be predicted as early as possible and focused on during treatment. \n\nStudies have proven that breast images can provide tumor biology behavior from multiple aspects but focus more on the changes during disease treatment. In the initial stage, the tumor baseline images can better reflect the original characteristics of the tumor. Ultrasonography is a low-cost imaging modality that increases cancer sensitivity and detection rates in dense breast populations. China has a relatively higher proportion of dense breast lesions than other countries (9), which explains the popularity and importance of ultrasound for Chinese breast screening. Moreover, with the continuous innovation of technology, multimodal ultrasound technology is more and more advocated because of its multiparameter and all-around evaluation ability. Shear wave elastography (SWE), a new technology in clinical applications in recent years, can provide quantitative information by measuring the stiffness of breast masses (10,11).",

Wen, Hai-na Zhao, Jingyan Liu, Xue-Meng Wan, Zihan Lan, Yulan Peng\n## Abstract\nBackground Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is the preferred treatment for advanced breast cancer nowadays. The early prediction of its responses is important for personalized treatment. This study aimed at using baseline shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound combined with clinical and pathological information to predict the clinical response to therapy in advanced breast cancer. Methods This retrospective study included 217 patients with advanced breast cancer who were treated in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from April 2020 to June 2022. The features of ultrasonic images were collected according to the Breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS), and the stiffness value was measured at the same time. The changes were measured according to the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST1.1) by MRI and clinical situation. The relevant indicators of clinical response were obtained through univariate analysis and incorporated into a logistic regression analysis to establish the prediction model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the prediction models. Results All patients were divided into a test set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. A total of 152 patients in the test set, with 41 patients (27.00%) in the non-responders group and 111 patients (73.00%) in the responders group, were finally included in this study. Among all unitary and combined mode models, the Pathology + B-mode + SWE model performed best, with the highest AUC of 0.808 (accuracy 72.37%, sensitivity 68.47%, specificity 82.93%, P<0.001). HER2+, Skin invasion, Post mammary space invasion, Myometrial invasion and Emax were the factors with a significant predictive value (P<0.05). 65 patients were used as an external validation set. There was no statistical difference in ROC between the test set and the validation set (P>0.05). Conclusion As the non-invasive imaging biomarkers, baseline SWE ultrasound combined with clinical and pathological information can be used to predict the clinical response to therapy in advanced breast cancer.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer has now surpassed lung cancer as the world's largest cancer, ranking first globally and fourth in China in the spectrum of cancer deaths in women (1,2). Advanced breast cancer (ABC), including locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), and metastatic breast cancer, which cannot undergo radical surgery at present, are related to the high incidence of metastasis and poor prognosis (3,4). Therefore, the main goal of its treatment is to delay the progress of the disease, prolong the survival time, and improve the quality of life of patients. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and salvage therapy for M1 stage breast cancer, instead of surgical resection at diagnosis, are recommended as the preferred treatment to ABC to provide more surgical opportunities and improve the survival rate according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (5). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of the curative effect is of particular significance. At present, the evaluation of clinical response is mainly carried out through pathological and clinical methods, that is, preoperative Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1) (6) and postoperative Miller-Payne (MP) Grading Criteria classification (7). In clinical application, the timing of surgery and intraoperative tumor resection volume are based on clinical response (8), which should be predicted as early as possible and focused on during treatment. \n\nStudies have proven that breast images can provide tumor biology behavior from multiple aspects but focus more on the changes during disease treatment. In the initial stage, the tumor baseline images can better reflect the original characteristics of the tumor. Ultrasonography is a low-cost imaging modality that increases cancer sensitivity and detection rates in dense breast populations. China has a relatively higher proportion of dense breast lesions than other countries (9), which explains the popularity and importance of ultrasound for Chinese breast screening. Moreover, with the continuous innovation of technology, multimodal ultrasound technology is more and more advocated because of its multiparameter and all-around evaluation ability. Shear wave elastography (SWE), a new technology in clinical applications in recent years, can provide quantitative information by measuring the stiffness of breast masses (10,11).",

Materials and methods Patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10-year risk-estimates of breast cancer mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31-phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication from preoperatively available data. Results We included 46 women (age: 43-74yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43%) had positive, and 26 patients (57%) negative indication for systemic therapy. Using conventional workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive postoperative indication (N = 8/8; 100%). Negative preoperative indication was correct in only 26/38 (68%) patients. However, 31P-MRS score (p = 0.030) and tumor size (p = 0.002) were associated with the postoperative indication. The decision model shows that negative indication is correct in 21/22 (96%) patients when exempting tumors larger than 2.0cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at 31P-MRS. Conclusions Preoperatively, positive indication for systemic therapy is highly accurate. Negative indication is highly accurate (96%) for tumors sized \u22642,0cm on DCE-MRI and with PME\u2264PDE ratios on 31P-MRS.",

                    "text": "Positive preoperative indication for systemic therapy based on biopsied tissue and conventional breast imaging showed high agreement with a positive postoperative indication from resected tissue (the gold standard). A negative preoperative indication was only accurate in tumors not larger than 2.0 cm on DCE-MRI or with a PME>PDE score at 31 P-MRS. Thus, in a subgroup of patients with early-stage breast cancer, preoperative multiparametric breast MRI at 7T enables an accurate risk assessment of breast cancer comparable to conventional assessment from surgically resected tissue. \n\nThese findings may ultimately have practice-changing impact on the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer, who are currently susceptible to overtreatment [29]. Continuous effort is made towards more individualized and less invasive therapy in this group of patients, but current guidelines for systemic therapy still require a representative resection specimen. Early-stage breast cancer patients in whom the positive indication for systemic therapy is known with high accuracy prior to surgery could be treated with systemic therapy prior to the surgical intervention, thus achieving similar long-term benefit as postoperative systemic therapy, but with the added benefit of allowing response of the tumor and axilla to be monitored [30]. This opens new treatment paradigms where patients with excellent response may be spared axillary surgery and minimalize the extent of breast surgery, which will reduce side effects and improve the quality of life after treatment [31,32]. Another possible scenario is to substitute surgery on a completely responding tumor with accelerated partial breast irradiation directed at the former tumor bed [33]. For early-stage breast cancer patients with a negative preoperative indication for systemic therapy, multiparametric 7T breast MRI could be added to the clinical workflow. Within this subgroup, patients with tumors of 2,0 cm or smaller on DCE-MRI and PME PDE score on 31 P-MRS may be suited for less invasive treatment, and the addition of a 7T MRI scan in this subgroup may give new impulse to ongoing studies on less-and non-invasive techniques for primary breast cancer treatment, such as MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound [7,8].",

Materials and methods Patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10-year risk-estimates of breast cancer mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31-phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication from preoperatively available data. Results We included 46 women (age: 43-74yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43%) had positive, and 26 patients (57%) negative indication for systemic therapy. Using conventional workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive postoperative indication (N = 8/8; 100%). Negative preoperative indication was correct in only 26/38 (68%) patients. However, 31P-MRS score (p = 0.030) and tumor size (p = 0.002) were associated with the postoperative indication. The decision model shows that negative indication is correct in 21/22 (96%) patients when exempting tumors larger than 2.0cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at 31P-MRS. Conclusions Preoperatively, positive indication for systemic therapy is highly accurate. Negative indication is highly accurate (96%) for tumors sized \u22642,0cm on DCE-MRI and with PME\u2264PDE ratios on 31P-MRS.\n## Discussion\nPositive preoperative indication for systemic therapy based on biopsied tissue and conventional breast imaging showed high agreement with a positive postoperative indication from resected tissue (the gold standard). A negative preoperative indication was only accurate in tumors not larger than 2.0 cm on DCE-MRI or with a PME>PDE score at 31 P-MRS. Thus, in a subgroup of patients with early-stage breast cancer, preoperative multiparametric breast MRI at 7T enables an accurate risk assessment of breast cancer comparable to conventional assessment from surgically resected tissue. \n\nThese findings may ultimately have practice-changing impact on the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer, who are currently susceptible to overtreatment [29]. Continuous effort is made towards more individualized and less invasive therapy in this group of patients, but current guidelines for systemic therapy still require a representative resection specimen. Early-stage breast cancer patients in whom the positive indication for systemic therapy is known with high accuracy prior to surgery could be treated with systemic therapy prior to the surgical intervention, thus achieving similar long-term benefit as postoperative systemic therapy, but with the added benefit of allowing response of the tumor and axilla to be monitored [30]. This opens new treatment paradigms where patients with excellent response may be spared axillary surgery and minimalize the extent of breast surgery, which will reduce side effects and improve the quality of life after treatment [31,32]. Another possible scenario is to substitute surgery on a completely responding tumor with accelerated partial breast irradiation directed at the former tumor bed [33]. For early-stage breast cancer patients with a negative preoperative indication for systemic therapy, multiparametric 7T breast MRI could be added to the clinical workflow. Within this subgroup, patients with tumors of 2,0 cm or smaller on DCE-MRI and PME PDE score on 31 P-MRS may be suited for less invasive treatment, and the addition of a 7T MRI scan in this subgroup may give new impulse to ongoing studies on less-and non-invasive techniques for primary breast cancer treatment, such as MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound [7,8].",

            "abstract": "Lumpectomy, also called breast-conserving surgery, has become the standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, accurately locating the tumor during a lumpectomy, especially when the lesion is small and nonpalpable, is a challenge. Such difficulty can lead to either incomplete tumor removal or prolonged surgical time, which result in high re-operation rates (~25%) and increased surgical costs. Here, we report a fiber optoacoustic guide (FOG) with augmented reality (AR) for sub-millimeter tumor localization and intuitive surgical guidance with minimal interference. The FOG is preoperatively implanted in the tumor. Under external pulsed light excitation, the FOG omnidirectionally broadcasts acoustic waves through the optoacoustic effect by a specially designed nano-composite layer at its tip. By capturing the acoustic wave, three ultrasound sensors on the breast skin triangulate the FOG tip\u2019s position with 0.25-mm accuracy. An AR system with a tablet measures the coordinates of the ultrasound sensors and transforms the FOG tip\u2019s position into visual feedback with <1-mm accuracy, thus aiding surgeons in directly visualizing the tumor location and performing fast and accurate tumor removal. We further show the use of a head-mounted display to visualize the same information in the surgeons\u2019 first-person view and achieve hands-free guidance. Towards clinical application, a surgeon successfully deployed the FOG to excise a \u201cpseudo tumor\u201d in a female human cadaver. With the high-accuracy tumor localization by FOG and the intuitive surgical guidance by AR, the surgeon performed accurate and fast tumor removal, which will significantly reduce re-operation rates and shorten the surgery time. Implanting an optoacoustic beacon into breast tumors provides surgeons with sub-millimeter localization accuracy when performing surgery. The system has been developed by Lu Lan from Boston University and coworkers. A fiber optoacoustic guide(FOG) which has a fiber tip coated with ZnO nanoparticles and graphite so that it is strongly light absorbing is implanted into the tumor prior to surgery. When exposed to pulsed light excitation the tip generates omnidirectional ultrasound waves due to the optoacoustic effect. The use of three ultrasound sensors to collect this signal makes it possible to accurately triangulate the exact location of the tumor during surgery. Combining the FOG with an augmented reality system offers surgeons an intuitive guidance aid which not only allows accurate and rapid tumor removal but will also help reduce the need for re-operation.",

                    "text": "In the United States, breast cancer ranks second as a cause of cancer-related death in women 1 . Breastconserving surgery (BCS), or lumpectomy, is a standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer and is favored for preservation of the breast, reduced morbidity, and rapid recovery [2][3][4] . Although BCS is the preferred surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer, it can be challenging to accurately identify the tumor site when the tumor is small and nonpalpable 5 . This difficulty can lead to inadequate clearance of the margins associated with increased risk of local recurrence, and it requires a second operation for adequate margins. The current re-operation rate is approximately 25% on average, but some series report rates as high as 37% [6][7][8][9][10] . Thus, surgical guidance tools that can accurately locate the tumor and optimize the resection of adequate margins in real time are needed. \n\nMammogram and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose and localize the breast tumor mass, but these technologies are bulky in size and not accessible in the operating room. The current gold standard of clinical practice to help locate the tumor during the surgery is guide wire localization (GWL) prior to surgery, in which a thin wire is inserted into the tumor mass under image guidance with its terminal tip within the tumor or tumor bed 11 . However, the location of the guide wire tip inside the breast tissue is not visible to the surgeon and only provides a rough estimation of the tumor location. Even with the GWL method, the re-operation rate remains high 12,13 . A newer method is seed implantation to improve the localization of the tumor during the operation. By utilizing a handheld probe to detect a beacon that is pre-implanted in the tumor mass, such as a radioactive/ radiofrequency seed 14,15 or a radiofrequency identification tag (RFID) 16 , the tumor location can be more accurately identified. The radioactive/radiofrequency seed methods can generally provide only the distance of the probe to the beacon in terms of pseudo numbers without units, which is a qualitative measure and is not accurate enough.",

Han, Pu Wang, Ji\u2010Xin Cheng\n## Abstract\nLumpectomy, also called breast-conserving surgery, has become the standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, accurately locating the tumor during a lumpectomy, especially when the lesion is small and nonpalpable, is a challenge. Such difficulty can lead to either incomplete tumor removal or prolonged surgical time, which result in high re-operation rates (~25%) and increased surgical costs. Here, we report a fiber optoacoustic guide (FOG) with augmented reality (AR) for sub-millimeter tumor localization and intuitive surgical guidance with minimal interference. The FOG is preoperatively implanted in the tumor. Under external pulsed light excitation, the FOG omnidirectionally broadcasts acoustic waves through the optoacoustic effect by a specially designed nano-composite layer at its tip. By capturing the acoustic wave, three ultrasound sensors on the breast skin triangulate the FOG tip\u2019s position with 0.25-mm accuracy. An AR system with a tablet measures the coordinates of the ultrasound sensors and transforms the FOG tip\u2019s position into visual feedback with <1-mm accuracy, thus aiding surgeons in directly visualizing the tumor location and performing fast and accurate tumor removal. We further show the use of a head-mounted display to visualize the same information in the surgeons\u2019 first-person view and achieve hands-free guidance. Towards clinical application, a surgeon successfully deployed the FOG to excise a \u201cpseudo tumor\u201d in a female human cadaver. With the high-accuracy tumor localization by FOG and the intuitive surgical guidance by AR, the surgeon performed accurate and fast tumor removal, which will significantly reduce re-operation rates and shorten the surgery time. Implanting an optoacoustic beacon into breast tumors provides surgeons with sub-millimeter localization accuracy when performing surgery. The system has been developed by Lu Lan from Boston University and coworkers. A fiber optoacoustic guide(FOG) which has a fiber tip coated with ZnO nanoparticles and graphite so that it is strongly light absorbing is implanted into the tumor prior to surgery. When exposed to pulsed light excitation the tip generates omnidirectional ultrasound waves due to the optoacoustic effect. The use of three ultrasound sensors to collect this signal makes it possible to accurately triangulate the exact location of the tumor during surgery. Combining the FOG with an augmented reality system offers surgeons an intuitive guidance aid which not only allows accurate and rapid tumor removal but will also help reduce the need for re-operation.\n## Introduction\nIn the United States, breast cancer ranks second as a cause of cancer-related death in women 1 . Breastconserving surgery (BCS), or lumpectomy, is a standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer and is favored for preservation of the breast, reduced morbidity, and rapid recovery [2][3][4] . Although BCS is the preferred surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer, it can be challenging to accurately identify the tumor site when the tumor is small and nonpalpable 5 . This difficulty can lead to inadequate clearance of the margins associated with increased risk of local recurrence, and it requires a second operation for adequate margins. The current re-operation rate is approximately 25% on average, but some series report rates as high as 37% [6][7][8][9][10] . Thus, surgical guidance tools that can accurately locate the tumor and optimize the resection of adequate margins in real time are needed. \n\nMammogram and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose and localize the breast tumor mass, but these technologies are bulky in size and not accessible in the operating room. The current gold standard of clinical practice to help locate the tumor during the surgery is guide wire localization (GWL) prior to surgery, in which a thin wire is inserted into the tumor mass under image guidance with its terminal tip within the tumor or tumor bed 11 . However, the location of the guide wire tip inside the breast tissue is not visible to the surgeon and only provides a rough estimation of the tumor location. Even with the GWL method, the re-operation rate remains high 12,13 . A newer method is seed implantation to improve the localization of the tumor during the operation. By utilizing a handheld probe to detect a beacon that is pre-implanted in the tumor mass, such as a radioactive/ radiofrequency seed 14,15 or a radiofrequency identification tag (RFID) 16 , the tumor location can be more accurately identified. The radioactive/radiofrequency seed methods can generally provide only the distance of the probe to the beacon in terms of pseudo numbers without units, which is a qualitative measure and is not accurate enough.",

A marker placed within a hypoechoic lesion can often be clearly visualized on ultrasound (US) [3]. However, in patients with a pathologically complete response (pCR), lesions may shrink significantly and become undetectable on US. In such cases, well-visible breast tissue markers must be placed in these lesions to facilitate optimal surgical planning and outcomes [4]. \n\nAlthough the effectiveness of surgical clip placement has been studied in breast cancer, there is a lack of comparative studies on different types of breast tissue markers after NACT [5].

Aboelezz, S. Moftah, Asmaa Magdy Mohamed Salama\n## Abstract\n\n \n \n Treatment for locally advanced breast cancer often involves the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Conservative surgery for the breast and axilla may be more challenging following NACT because some lesions may become invisible on preoperative imaging. This study aimed to compare surgical clips and US-visualized tissue markers for ultrasound tumor localization in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n \n \n \n This was a comparative cross-sectional study conducted on 34 breast cancer patients prepared for NACT. In this study, prior to chemotherapy, 34 clips were used, of which 17 surgical clips were inserted in 17 lesions and another 17 US visible tissue markers were inserted in another 17 lesions; both types were inserted under US guidance. After NACT cycles, the clipped masses were compared by US.\n \n \n \n Approximately 76.5% of patients had a negative family history, and 23.5% had a positive family history. The most common hormonal profile was ER and PR positive, HER2 negative (35.3%), followed by triple negative (32.4%) and ER positive, PR and HER2 negative (14.7%). Ductal carcinoma was found in 91.2% of cases, and lobular carcinoma in 8.8%. Lumpectomy was performed in 88.2% of cases, with mastectomy in 11.8%. No significant differences were found in clip visualization between surgical clips and tissue markers (58.8% vs. 64.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.17) or in pain incidence (35.3% vs. 23.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.71). Complications, including infection, hematoma, and migration, were similar in both groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). After NACT, no significant differences in clip visualization or radiological response were observed between the two groups.\n \n \n \n Visualizations of both surgical clips and ultrasound-visible tissue markers on US before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were nearly equivalent, regardless of lesion prognosis or complete radiological response. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding complications.\n\n## body\nmethods to mark tumor sites and lymph nodes in the post-NACT setting to guide surgical decisions [2]. \n\nWhen considering breast-conserving surgery (BCS), marker insertion prior to surgery is essential. A marker placed within a hypoechoic lesion can often be clearly visualized on ultrasound (US) [3]. However, in patients with a pathologically complete response (pCR), lesions may shrink significantly and become undetectable on US. In such cases, well-visible breast tissue markers must be placed in these lesions to facilitate optimal surgical planning and outcomes [4]. \n\nAlthough the effectiveness of surgical clip placement has been studied in breast cancer, there is a lack of comparative studies on different types of breast tissue markers after NACT [5]. Understanding which types of markers are more visible on specific imaging modalities is essential, as this knowledge would assist radiologists in selecting the most appropriate marker for each patient before insertion [6]. \n\nThe visibility of the breast tissue marker is crucial for effective localization. While US and mammography can both be used for localization, almost all markers are visible on mammography. However, mammography-guided localization carries radiation risks, making US the more feasible method for localization [7]. \n\nSurgical clips placed in the tumor bed are considered a safe and cost-effective technique for facilitating tumor localization before surgical resection in patients undergoing NACT [8]. The goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of surgical clips and ultrasound-visible tissue markers for tumor localization in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

This technique provides 3D spatial information of the entire tumor volume, in contrast to the single reference point provided by wire localization. A comparison study between patients undergoing wire localization and supine MRI-guided breast-conserving surgery showed that the positive margin rate and resected tissue volume were lower in the MRI-guided excision group [20]. \n\nThe removed tissue from the MRI-guided group was volumetrically smaller (27.5 cm 3 ) than that in the standard BCS group (57.6 cm 3 ). The positive margin rate was lower in the new technique group (12.5%) than in the standard BCS group (39.3%) [20]. The gathered results, created using the data from the study by Sakakibara S. et al., are shown in Figure 1 [20]. Optical scanners allow for the adjustment of MRI scans of the breasts onto the patient on the operating room (OR) table. This approach facilitates the separation of preoperative imaging and surgery, allowing them to occur on different days [21]. The 3D printing technique, coupled with intraoperative tracking technology, ensures the localization of breast cancer with utmost accuracy [21]. A study on the 3D printing technique reveals that the distance of the predicted tumor edges in imaging is very precise, measuring <1 cm [21]. In prospective trials, lumpectomy of palpable cancers tends to be imprecise, resulting in positive margins in 28-29% of cases [22,23]. The likelihood of navigation system mismatch is very low, minimizing errors.",

A comparison study between patients undergoing wire localization and supine MRI-guided breast-conserving surgery showed that the positive margin rate and resected tissue volume were lower in the MRI-guided excision group [20]. \n\nThe removed tissue from the MRI-guided group was volumetrically smaller (27.5 cm 3 ) than that in the standard BCS group (57.6 cm 3 ). The positive margin rate was lower in the new technique group (12.5%) than in the standard BCS group (39.3%) [20]. The gathered results, created using the data from the study by Sakakibara S. et al., are shown in Figure 1 [20]. Optical scanners allow for the adjustment of MRI scans of the breasts onto the patient on the operating room (OR) table. This approach facilitates the separation of preoperative imaging and surgery, allowing them to occur on different days [21]. The 3D printing technique, coupled with intraoperative tracking technology, ensures the localization of breast cancer with utmost accuracy [21]. A study on the 3D printing technique reveals that the distance of the predicted tumor edges in imaging is very precise, measuring <1 cm [21]. In prospective trials, lumpectomy of palpable cancers tends to be imprecise, resulting in positive margins in 28-29% of cases [22,23]. The likelihood of navigation system mismatch is very low, minimizing errors.",

This system is a promising technique to improve lesion detection and analysis, to maximize advantages of each imaging modality, and to compensate the disadvantages of both MRI and ultrasound. In evaluating breast cancer stage preoperatively, MRI and ultrasound are the most representative imaging modalities. However, sometimes difficulties arise in interpreting and correlating the radiological features between these two different modalities. This pictorial essay demonstrates the technical principles of the real-time MRI navigated ultrasound, and clinical implementation of the system in preoperative evaluation of tumor extent, multiplicity, and nodal status in breast cancer patients.",

                    "text": "Real-time image fusion has been widely applied to liver diseases (3). Several investigations reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT/MRI was superior to conventional ultrasound in detection of hepatic nodules, especially for small hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis (4)(5)(6). By extension, CT/MRI navigated ultrasound was useful to guide radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas that are poorly defined on conventional ultrasound (7)(8)(9). \n\nRecently, the utility of real-time image fusion also has been investigated in the field of breast. Yamamoto et al. (10) reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT-lymphography improved the preoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes, and its accuracy for predicting metastasis was 81%. Breast MRI and ultrasound are the most popular imaging modalities for the assessment of preoperative stages of breast cancer. Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (15)(16)(17)(18). Consequently, real-time MRI navigated ultrasound and biopsy could replace the MRI-guided biopsy for MRI-detected lesions. \n\nThe purpose of the current pictorial essay is to illustrate the technical principles of real-time MRI navigated ultrasound, and to demonstrate the clinical implementation of the system in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients.",

Seo\n## Abstract\nReal-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) navigated ultrasound is an image fusion technique to display the results of both MRI and ultrasonography on the same monitor. This system is a promising technique to improve lesion detection and analysis, to maximize advantages of each imaging modality, and to compensate the disadvantages of both MRI and ultrasound. In evaluating breast cancer stage preoperatively, MRI and ultrasound are the most representative imaging modalities. However, sometimes difficulties arise in interpreting and correlating the radiological features between these two different modalities. This pictorial essay demonstrates the technical principles of the real-time MRI navigated ultrasound, and clinical implementation of the system in preoperative evaluation of tumor extent, multiplicity, and nodal status in breast cancer patients.\n## body\nReal-time image fusion has been widely applied to liver diseases (3). Several investigations reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT/MRI was superior to conventional ultrasound in detection of hepatic nodules, especially for small hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis (4)(5)(6). By extension, CT/MRI navigated ultrasound was useful to guide radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas that are poorly defined on conventional ultrasound (7)(8)(9). \n\nRecently, the utility of real-time image fusion also has been investigated in the field of breast. Yamamoto et al. (10) reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT-lymphography improved the preoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes, and its accuracy for predicting metastasis was 81%. Breast MRI and ultrasound are the most popular imaging modalities for the assessment of preoperative stages of breast cancer. Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (15)(16)(17)(18). Consequently, real-time MRI navigated ultrasound and biopsy could replace the MRI-guided biopsy for MRI-detected lesions. \n\nThe purpose of the current pictorial essay is to illustrate the technical principles of real-time MRI navigated ultrasound, and to demonstrate the clinical implementation of the system in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients.",

However, the lower and variable specificity of MRI makes the MRI-guided intervention, including biopsies and localizations, necessary before surgery, especially for patients who need the treatment of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). MRI techniques and patient preparation should be first carefully considered before the intervention to avoid lengthening the procedure time and compromising targeting accuracy. Doctors and radiologists need to reconfirm the target of the lesion and be very familiar with the process approach and equipment techniques involving the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and the biopsy system and follow a correct way. The basic steps of MRI-guided biopsy and localization are nearly the same regardless of the vendor or platform, and this article systematically introduces detailed methods and techniques of MRI-guided intervention. The two interventions both face different challenging situations during procedures with solutions given in the article. Post-operative statistics show that the complications of MRI-guided intervention are infrequent and mild, and MRI-guided biopsy provides the pathological information for the subsequent surgical decisions and MRI-guided localization fully prepared for follow-up surgical biopsy. New techniques for MRI-guided intervention are also elaborated in the article, which leads to future development. In a word, MRI-guided intervention is a safe, accurate, and effective technique with a low complication rate and successful MRI-guided intervention is truly teamwork with efforts from patients to surgeons, radiologists, MRI technologists, and nurses.",

The early diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer are of vital importance, especially for young women with the treatment of breast-conserving surgery (BCS, also known as partial mastectomy or lumpectomy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as an integral tool that is used in combination with mammography and Ivyspring International Publisher ultrasound, has a sensitivity ranging from 86% to 100% in the detection of breast lesions [2][3][4][5]. MRI remains the most powerful tool for detecting clinically suspected lesions which are mammographically and sonographically occult. However, the specificity of MRI is between 37% and 97% [6][7][8][9]. The lower and variable specificity is primarily due to considerable overlap in the appearance of benign and malignant lesions. Thus, breast MRI is often performed as a preoperative examination for suspected lesions that can't be seen with mammography and ultrasound to assess the disease extent. Moreover, MRI-guided localization and biopsy of suspicious lesions are often needed before the surgery, particularly for the young women who deserve to receive BCS. Besides, MRIguided intervention is a valid technique for the diagnosis of suspicious non-palpable lesions (NPLs) and small masses, which is easy to cause misdiagnosis and delay the treatment of the diseases. These MRIguided interventions, which are safe, accurate, and effective with a low complication rate that includes infection, hematoma information, and pneumothorax, have transformed the practice of breast imaging [10][11][12][13][14]. \n\nSince the 1990s, MRI has been used for breast cancer screening and staging. In 2010, the American College of Radiology (ACR) required facilities to have the equipment to have MRI-guided interventions or have an agreement with the referral center to do so. Successful MRI images analysis for breast tumors is a crucial component for breast surgery [2,15,16].",

Kong, Ying Song, Yan Song, Yi Fang, Ouyang Han, Jing Wang\n## Abstract\nWith a high sensitivity of breast lesions, MRI can detect suspicious lesions which are occult in traditional breast examination equipment. However, the lower and variable specificity of MRI makes the MRI-guided intervention, including biopsies and localizations, necessary before surgery, especially for patients who need the treatment of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). MRI techniques and patient preparation should be first carefully considered before the intervention to avoid lengthening the procedure time and compromising targeting accuracy. Doctors and radiologists need to reconfirm the target of the lesion and be very familiar with the process approach and equipment techniques involving the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and the biopsy system and follow a correct way. The basic steps of MRI-guided biopsy and localization are nearly the same regardless of the vendor or platform, and this article systematically introduces detailed methods and techniques of MRI-guided intervention. The two interventions both face different challenging situations during procedures with solutions given in the article. Post-operative statistics show that the complications of MRI-guided intervention are infrequent and mild, and MRI-guided biopsy provides the pathological information for the subsequent surgical decisions and MRI-guided localization fully prepared for follow-up surgical biopsy. New techniques for MRI-guided intervention are also elaborated in the article, which leads to future development. In a word, MRI-guided intervention is a safe, accurate, and effective technique with a low complication rate and successful MRI-guided intervention is truly teamwork with efforts from patients to surgeons, radiologists, MRI technologists, and nurses.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer ranks first among all female tumors, and it tends to be diagnosed at a younger age than other common cancers, with a great threat to women's health and safety [1]. The early diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer are of vital importance, especially for young women with the treatment of breast-conserving surgery (BCS, also known as partial mastectomy or lumpectomy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as an integral tool that is used in combination with mammography and Ivyspring International Publisher ultrasound, has a sensitivity ranging from 86% to 100% in the detection of breast lesions [2][3][4][5]. MRI remains the most powerful tool for detecting clinically suspected lesions which are mammographically and sonographically occult. However, the specificity of MRI is between 37% and 97% [6][7][8][9]. The lower and variable specificity is primarily due to considerable overlap in the appearance of benign and malignant lesions. Thus, breast MRI is often performed as a preoperative examination for suspected lesions that can't be seen with mammography and ultrasound to assess the disease extent. Moreover, MRI-guided localization and biopsy of suspicious lesions are often needed before the surgery, particularly for the young women who deserve to receive BCS. Besides, MRIguided intervention is a valid technique for the diagnosis of suspicious non-palpable lesions (NPLs) and small masses, which is easy to cause misdiagnosis and delay the treatment of the diseases. These MRIguided interventions, which are safe, accurate, and effective with a low complication rate that includes infection, hematoma information, and pneumothorax, have transformed the practice of breast imaging [10][11][12][13][14]. \n\nSince the 1990s, MRI has been used for breast cancer screening and staging. In 2010, the American College of Radiology (ACR) required facilities to have the equipment to have MRI-guided interventions or have an agreement with the referral center to do so. Successful MRI images analysis for breast tumors is a crucial component for breast surgery [2,15,16].",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and surgical biopsies that may increase effectiveness of wire-guided percutaneous localizations for non-palpable breast lesions. METHODS A retrospective review of a sample of 149 patients who underwent wire-guided localization with wide local excision for non-palpable breast lesions at the authors\u2019 institution between January 2013 and April 2016. After IRB approval, sample patients\u2019 records were reviewed and data were collected concerning their radiological, histological and surgical characteristics. RESULTS One (0.67%) complication occurred related to wire migration. There were nine (6.04%) recorded cases of seroma and three (2.01%) cases of hematoma. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) Category 4 was found to have a positive predictive value of 28.4% for breast cancer. Under Category 4 subcategorization 4A, 4B, and 4C, the number of positive lesions were two (6.89%), three (10.34%) and five (17.24%), respectively. Forty (78.43%) of the 51 patients with cancer had negative (i.e., non-cancerous) margins compared to 11 (21.57%) cases that had positive margins after the first procedure. CONCLUSION The BI-RADS Category 4 encompasses the majority of lesions, with approximately 70% of such biopsies lesions later found to be benign. A subcategorization of BI-RADS 4 needs further clarification in distinguishing benign vs malignant imaging characteristics. Future retrospective studies designed to identify benign vs. malignant lesions, confirmed by validating prospective studies, will better clarify a new subcategorization of BI-RADS Category 4, thus allowing surgeons and radiologists to make the best surgical recommendations for their patients.",

                    "text": "It has been demonstrated that early stage diagnosis of clinically non-palpable malignant lesions can be achieved by utilizing many imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasonography and image-guided sampling for histopathology. 13 In conservative breast surgery, the biggest challenge for the surgeon remains obtaining clear surgical margins. Positive excision margins significantly increase local recurrence, 14 because re-excisional lumpectomy or mastectomy must then be performed. 15 or more conservative breast lesion localization, the use of WGL metallic markers, 2 ultrasound guided surgery, 16 and the radio-guided occult lesion localization technique 17 are now routinely used. Wire-guided biopsy is a well-known technique that has been used since the 1970s. In our study, WGL was successful in 100% of benign sample patients, with overall similar fewer complications related to surgical technique. \n\nIn our study, positive surgical margins were found in 11 (21.6%) of our 51 malignant lesions. Of the 11 patients with positive margins, seven (63.6%) underwent mastectomies, with the other four (36.4%) undergoing re-excisional lumpectomies. The total number of mastectomies performed as re-excisions in this study was 12, this number including the seven previously listed, and the five mastectomies that were performed after initial negative margins. \n\nThe total number of mastectomies needed to achieve satisfactory margins in patients after initial WGL was 10 (19.6%), as compared to the 20% reported in the literature. 18 There were two additional patients who underwent re-excisional lumpectomies after initial negative margins to obtain more satisfactory negative margins. \n\nThe BI-RADS is a standardized radiological reporting system that was established in 1993 by the American College of Radiology and has been modified multiple times to include other radiological modalities (e g., ultrasonography) that was initially oriented to mammography. 19 ][22] Our study found a very statistically significant association between BI-RADS and histology type.",

Olson\n## Abstract\nINTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and surgical biopsies that may increase effectiveness of wire-guided percutaneous localizations for non-palpable breast lesions. METHODS A retrospective review of a sample of 149 patients who underwent wire-guided localization with wide local excision for non-palpable breast lesions at the authors\u2019 institution between January 2013 and April 2016. After IRB approval, sample patients\u2019 records were reviewed and data were collected concerning their radiological, histological and surgical characteristics. RESULTS One (0.67%) complication occurred related to wire migration. There were nine (6.04%) recorded cases of seroma and three (2.01%) cases of hematoma. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) Category 4 was found to have a positive predictive value of 28.4% for breast cancer. Under Category 4 subcategorization 4A, 4B, and 4C, the number of positive lesions were two (6.89%), three (10.34%) and five (17.24%), respectively. Forty (78.43%) of the 51 patients with cancer had negative (i.e., non-cancerous) margins compared to 11 (21.57%) cases that had positive margins after the first procedure. CONCLUSION The BI-RADS Category 4 encompasses the majority of lesions, with approximately 70% of such biopsies lesions later found to be benign. A subcategorization of BI-RADS 4 needs further clarification in distinguishing benign vs malignant imaging characteristics. Future retrospective studies designed to identify benign vs. malignant lesions, confirmed by validating prospective studies, will better clarify a new subcategorization of BI-RADS Category 4, thus allowing surgeons and radiologists to make the best surgical recommendations for their patients.\n## DISCUSSION\nIt has been demonstrated that early stage diagnosis of clinically non-palpable malignant lesions can be achieved by utilizing many imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasonography and image-guided sampling for histopathology. 13 In conservative breast surgery, the biggest challenge for the surgeon remains obtaining clear surgical margins. Positive excision margins significantly increase local recurrence, 14 because re-excisional lumpectomy or mastectomy must then be performed. 15 or more conservative breast lesion localization, the use of WGL metallic markers, 2 ultrasound guided surgery, 16 and the radio-guided occult lesion localization technique 17 are now routinely used. Wire-guided biopsy is a well-known technique that has been used since the 1970s. In our study, WGL was successful in 100% of benign sample patients, with overall similar fewer complications related to surgical technique. \n\nIn our study, positive surgical margins were found in 11 (21.6%) of our 51 malignant lesions. Of the 11 patients with positive margins, seven (63.6%) underwent mastectomies, with the other four (36.4%) undergoing re-excisional lumpectomies. The total number of mastectomies performed as re-excisions in this study was 12, this number including the seven previously listed, and the five mastectomies that were performed after initial negative margins. \n\nThe total number of mastectomies needed to achieve satisfactory margins in patients after initial WGL was 10 (19.6%), as compared to the 20% reported in the literature. 18 There were two additional patients who underwent re-excisional lumpectomies after initial negative margins to obtain more satisfactory negative margins. \n\nThe BI-RADS is a standardized radiological reporting system that was established in 1993 by the American College of Radiology and has been modified multiple times to include other radiological modalities (e g., ultrasonography) that was initially oriented to mammography. 19 ][22] Our study found a very statistically significant association between BI-RADS and histology type.",

Feasibility of EC17, a FR\u03b1-targeting agent that fluoresces at 500nm, was demonstrated in a limited series of ovarian cancer patients. Our objective was to evaluate EC17 in a larger group of ovarian cancer patients. In addition, we assessed the feasibility of EC17 in patients with breast cancer. Methods Two-to-three hours before surgery 0.1mg/kg EC17 was intravenously administered to 12 patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer and to 3 patients undergoing surgery for biopsy-proven FR\u03b1-positive breast cancer. The number of lesions/positive margins detected with fluorescence and concordance between fluorescence and tumor- and FR\u03b1-status was assessed in addition to safety and pharmacokinetics. Results Fluorescence imaging in ovarian cancer patients allowed detection of 57 lesions of which 44 (77%) appeared malignant on histopathology. Seven out of these 44 (16%) were not detected with inspection/palpation. Histopathology demonstrated concordance between fluorescence and FR\u03b1- and tumor status. Fluorescence imaging in breast cancer patients, allowed detection of tumor-specific fluorescence signal. At the 500nm wavelength, autofluorescence of normal breast tissue was present to such extent that it interfered with tumor identification. Conclusions FR\u03b1 is a favorable target for fluorescence-guided surgery as EC17 produced a clear fluorescent signal in ovarian and breast cancer tissue. This resulted in resection of ovarian cancer lesions that were otherwise not detected. Notwithstanding, autofluorescence caused false-positive lesions in ovarian cancer and difficulty in discriminating breast cancer-specific fluorescence from background signal. Optimization of the 500nm fluorophore, will minimize autofluorescence and further improve intraoperative tumor detection.",

In this study, real-time visualization of malignant lesions using fluorescence imaging during surgery led to the detection of 16% additional malignant lesions. This may improve cytoreduction and hereby patient outcome. The effect of the addition of intraoperative fluorescence imaging on survival was already shown by Stummer et al. in patients with brain glioma. They demonstrated that fluorescence imaging with 5-ala not only leads to more complete resections but also to improved progression free survival [5]. For ovarian cancer more prospective research is necessary to establish the effect on overall survival. When patients present with clinically early stage ovarian cancer, a staging procedure is recommended. During this procedure, biopsies of suspicious lesions are taken, supplemented with \"blind\" biopsies from predefined locations. Ultimate goal is to identify metastatic lesions whenever present in order to give adequate treatment i.e. systemic chemotherapy. Visualizing metastatic lesions by fluorescence imaging may optimize staging procedures, as less \"blind\" biopsies have to be taken. This could facilitate discrimination between true early stage ovarian cancer and more advanced stage with occult tumor spread. Especially in minimal-invasive surgery, when tactile information (palpation) of lesions cannot be obtained, fluorescence imaging could be of additional value. In breast cancer, up to 20% of patients have positive resection margins after resection of the primary tumor [3]. Visualizing tumor cells during surgery could lower the risk of an incomplete resection as identification of a positive margin can result in direct resection of residual tumor tissue. Although this will probably not influence overall survival, as patient with positive resection margins are currently treated with a re-resection or more intensive radiotherapy, significantly lower healthcare costs and burden to the patient could result. To investigate this concept, both FR\u03b1 positive breast cancer patients treated with BCS and breast ablation were included in the current feasibility study. However, for future applicability of fluorescence imaging in breast cancer surgery, the most added value is to be expected in BCS.",

Tummers, Charlotte E. S. Hoogstins, K. Gaarenstroom, Cornelis D de Kroon, M. V. van Poelgeest, J. Vuyk, T. Bosse, V. Smit, C. J. van de Velde, A. Cohen, P. Low, J. Burggraaf, A. Vahrmeijer\n## Abstract\nIntroduction Intraoperative fluorescence imaging of the folate-receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) could support completeness of resection in cancer surgery. Feasibility of EC17, a FR\u03b1-targeting agent that fluoresces at 500nm, was demonstrated in a limited series of ovarian cancer patients. Our objective was to evaluate EC17 in a larger group of ovarian cancer patients. In addition, we assessed the feasibility of EC17 in patients with breast cancer. Methods Two-to-three hours before surgery 0.1mg/kg EC17 was intravenously administered to 12 patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer and to 3 patients undergoing surgery for biopsy-proven FR\u03b1-positive breast cancer. The number of lesions/positive margins detected with fluorescence and concordance between fluorescence and tumor- and FR\u03b1-status was assessed in addition to safety and pharmacokinetics. Results Fluorescence imaging in ovarian cancer patients allowed detection of 57 lesions of which 44 (77%) appeared malignant on histopathology. Seven out of these 44 (16%) were not detected with inspection/palpation. Histopathology demonstrated concordance between fluorescence and FR\u03b1- and tumor status. Fluorescence imaging in breast cancer patients, allowed detection of tumor-specific fluorescence signal. At the 500nm wavelength, autofluorescence of normal breast tissue was present to such extent that it interfered with tumor identification. Conclusions FR\u03b1 is a favorable target for fluorescence-guided surgery as EC17 produced a clear fluorescent signal in ovarian and breast cancer tissue. This resulted in resection of ovarian cancer lesions that were otherwise not detected. Notwithstanding, autofluorescence caused false-positive lesions in ovarian cancer and difficulty in discriminating breast cancer-specific fluorescence from background signal. Optimization of the 500nm fluorophore, will minimize autofluorescence and further improve intraoperative tumor detection.\n## DISCUSSION\n[4,6,8,38,39]. In this study, real-time visualization of malignant lesions using fluorescence imaging during surgery led to the detection of 16% additional malignant lesions. This may improve cytoreduction and hereby patient outcome. The effect of the addition of intraoperative fluorescence imaging on survival was already shown by Stummer et al. in patients with brain glioma. They demonstrated that fluorescence imaging with 5-ala not only leads to more complete resections but also to improved progression free survival [5]. For ovarian cancer more prospective research is necessary to establish the effect on overall survival. When patients present with clinically early stage ovarian cancer, a staging procedure is recommended. During this procedure, biopsies of suspicious lesions are taken, supplemented with \"blind\" biopsies from predefined locations. Ultimate goal is to identify metastatic lesions whenever present in order to give adequate treatment i.e. systemic chemotherapy. Visualizing metastatic lesions by fluorescence imaging may optimize staging procedures, as less \"blind\" biopsies have to be taken. This could facilitate discrimination between true early stage ovarian cancer and more advanced stage with occult tumor spread. Especially in minimal-invasive surgery, when tactile information (palpation) of lesions cannot be obtained, fluorescence imaging could be of additional value. In breast cancer, up to 20% of patients have positive resection margins after resection of the primary tumor [3]. Visualizing tumor cells during surgery could lower the risk of an incomplete resection as identification of a positive margin can result in direct resection of residual tumor tissue. Although this will probably not influence overall survival, as patient with positive resection margins are currently treated with a re-resection or more intensive radiotherapy, significantly lower healthcare costs and burden to the patient could result. To investigate this concept, both FR\u03b1 positive breast cancer patients treated with BCS and breast ablation were included in the current feasibility study. However, for future applicability of fluorescence imaging in breast cancer surgery, the most added value is to be expected in BCS.",

Application of the emerging MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) technique in breast radiotherapy may enable more accurate targeting and potentially reduce side effects associated with treatment. Purpose To study the feasibility of delivering MRI-guided partial breast radiotherapy or Precision Prone Irradiation (PPI) to treat DCIS and early stage breast cancer patients. Materials and methods Eleven patients with diagnosed DCIS or early stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy underwent CT-based and MRI-based simulations and treatment planning in the prone position. MRI-guided radiotherapy was utilized to deliver partial breast irradiation. A customized adaptive plan was created for each delivered radiotherapy fraction and the cumulative doses to the target volumes and nearby organs at risk were determined. The CT-based and the MRI-guided radiotherapy plans were compared with respect to target volumes, target volume coverage, and dose to nearby organs. Results All patients receiving PPI successfully completed their treatments as planned. Clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) dose coverage and organs-at-risk (OAR) dose constraints were met in all fractions planned and delivered and the MRI-guided clinical target volumes were smaller when compared to those of the CT-based partial breast radiotherapy plans for these eleven patients. Conclusions MRI-guided partial breast radiotherapy as a breast radiotherapy technology is feasible and is a potential high clinical impact application of MRgRT. PPI has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of breast radiotherapy by more accurately delivering radiation dose to the cavity target and decreasing toxicities associated with radiation to the surrounding normal tissues.

            "abstract": "Purpose This research aimed to analyze electron stream effect (ESE) during magnetic resonance image guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) for breast cancer patients on a MR-Linac (0.35 Tesla, 6MV), with a focus on the prevention of redundant radiation exposure. Materials and methods RANDO phantom was used with and without the breast attachment in order to represent the patients after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those received modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The prescription dose is 40.05 Gy in fifteen fractions for whole breast irradiation (WBI) or 20 Gy single shot for partial breast irradiation (PBI). Thirteen different portals of intensity-modulated radiation therapy were created. And then we evaluated dose distribution in five areas (on the skin of the tip of the nose, the chin, the neck, the abdomen and the thyroid.) outside of the irradiated field with and without 0.35 Tesla. In addition, we added a piece of bolus with the thickness of 1cm on the skin in order to compare the ESE difference with and without a bolus. Lastly, we loaded two patients\u2019 images for PBI comparison. Results We found that 0.35 Tesla caused redundant doses to the skin of the chin and the neck as high as 9.79% and 5.59% of the prescription dose in the BCS RANDO model, respectively. For RANDO phantom without the breast accessory (simulating MRM), the maximal dose increase were 8.71% and 4.67% of the prescription dose to the skin of the chin and the neck, respectively. Furthermore, the bolus we added efficiently decrease the unnecessary dose caused by ESE up to 59.8%. Conclusion We report the first physical investigation on successful avoidance of superfluous doses on a 0.35T MR-Linac for breast cancer patients. Future studies of MRgRT on the individual body shape and its association with ESE influence is warranted.",

                    "text": "Breast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

Lu, Cheng-Han Chiang, Ming-Yi Huang, Chih\u2010Jen Huang\n## Abstract\nPurpose This research aimed to analyze electron stream effect (ESE) during magnetic resonance image guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) for breast cancer patients on a MR-Linac (0.35 Tesla, 6MV), with a focus on the prevention of redundant radiation exposure. Materials and methods RANDO phantom was used with and without the breast attachment in order to represent the patients after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those received modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The prescription dose is 40.05 Gy in fifteen fractions for whole breast irradiation (WBI) or 20 Gy single shot for partial breast irradiation (PBI). Thirteen different portals of intensity-modulated radiation therapy were created. And then we evaluated dose distribution in five areas (on the skin of the tip of the nose, the chin, the neck, the abdomen and the thyroid.) outside of the irradiated field with and without 0.35 Tesla. In addition, we added a piece of bolus with the thickness of 1cm on the skin in order to compare the ESE difference with and without a bolus. Lastly, we loaded two patients\u2019 images for PBI comparison. Results We found that 0.35 Tesla caused redundant doses to the skin of the chin and the neck as high as 9.79% and 5.59% of the prescription dose in the BCS RANDO model, respectively. For RANDO phantom without the breast accessory (simulating MRM), the maximal dose increase were 8.71% and 4.67% of the prescription dose to the skin of the chin and the neck, respectively. Furthermore, the bolus we added efficiently decrease the unnecessary dose caused by ESE up to 59.8%. Conclusion We report the first physical investigation on successful avoidance of superfluous doses on a 0.35T MR-Linac for breast cancer patients. Future studies of MRgRT on the individual body shape and its association with ESE influence is warranted.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

It is well established that breast MRI is by far superior to mammography, with or without concomitant ultrasound, for the local staging of breast cancer. MRI allows the most accurate delineation of the size and the local extent of cancer, including the depiction of multifocal, multicentric or contralateral disease. MRI offers the highest sensitivity for demonstrating intraductal extensions around invasive cancers. For all these reasons, MRI should be considered an integral part of the workup of patients who undergo breast conserving treatment. And yet, the technique is only slowly adopted in clinical practice. Arguments against the use of breast MRI include costs, frequency of false positive diagnoses, lack of availability of minimally invasive biopsy capabilities, lack of evidence by randomized controlled clinical trials, and, last, fear of overtreatment. In this lecture, these concerns are explained, discussed and weighted against the advantages of MRI for breast cancer staging. The point is made that breast MRI is indeed essential for surgical planning, but that unnecessary mastectomy may result if old guidelines (established for mammographic staging) are used to guide management decisions regarding MR-detected lesions. Guidelines that require mastectomy for multicentric breast cancer were established before the advent of MRI. Using the same guidelines to manage MR-detected multicentric foci may be inappropriate because some of the small MRI-detected multicentric foci may be sufficiently treated by additional lumpectomy or even by radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) has become the standard treatment for patients with advanced breast cancers and is now a potential treatment for patients with earlier-stage operable disease. Pathological response of tumours to NC appears to correlate with the outcome. The advantage of NC is that it not only increases breast-conserving surgery, but also enables direct in vivo assessment of response. Breast imaging is used to evaluate the shrinkage of tumour under treatment and to try determine responders. Physical examination associated with mammography and ultrasound is a valuable noninvasive combination for assessing tumour response. At this time, this morphologic evaluation is the only one recognised by the international criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for the",

MRI allows the most accurate delineation of the size and the local extent of cancer, including the depiction of multifocal, multicentric or contralateral disease. MRI offers the highest sensitivity for demonstrating intraductal extensions around invasive cancers. For all these reasons, MRI should be considered an integral part of the workup of patients who undergo breast conserving treatment. And yet, the technique is only slowly adopted in clinical practice. Arguments against the use of breast MRI include costs, frequency of false positive diagnoses, lack of availability of minimally invasive biopsy capabilities, lack of evidence by randomized controlled clinical trials, and, last, fear of overtreatment. In this lecture, these concerns are explained, discussed and weighted against the advantages of MRI for breast cancer staging. The point is made that breast MRI is indeed essential for surgical planning, but that unnecessary mastectomy may result if old guidelines (established for mammographic staging) are used to guide management decisions regarding MR-detected lesions. Guidelines that require mastectomy for multicentric breast cancer were established before the advent of MRI. Using the same guidelines to manage MR-detected multicentric foci may be inappropriate because some of the small MRI-detected multicentric foci may be sufficiently treated by additional lumpectomy or even by radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) has become the standard treatment for patients with advanced breast cancers and is now a potential treatment for patients with earlier-stage operable disease. Pathological response of tumours to NC appears to correlate with the outcome. The advantage of NC is that it not only increases breast-conserving surgery, but also enables direct in vivo assessment of response. Breast imaging is used to evaluate the shrinkage of tumour under treatment and to try determine responders. Physical examination associated with mammography and ultrasound is a valuable noninvasive combination for assessing tumour response. At this time, this morphologic evaluation is the only one recognised by the international criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for the",

It has contributed significantly toward identifying the abnormalities in tissues and cells, but has inherent drawbacks when used for fast and accurate diagnosis. These limitations include the lack of in vivo observation in real time and sampling errors due to limited number and area coverage of tissue sections. Its diagnostic yield also varies depending on the ability of the physician and the effectiveness of any image guidance technique that may be used for tissue screening during excisional biopsy. In order to overcome these current limitations of histology-based diagnostics, there are significant needs for either complementary or alternative imaging techniques which perform non-destructive, high resolution, and rapid tissue screening. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging imaging modality which allows real-time cross-sectional imaging with high resolutions that approach those of histology. OCT could be a very promising technique which has the potential to be used as an adjunct to histological tissue observation when it is not practical to take specimens for histological processing, when large areas of tissue need investigating, or when rapid microscopic imaging is needed. This review will describe the use of OCT as an image guidance tool for fast tissue screening and directed histological tissue sectioning in pathology.",

                    "text": "A surgical microscope is routinely used to guide delicate surgery by magnifying the surface features of tissue. The development of advanced imaging techniques capable of high resolution and real time visualization of sub-surface tissue structure could provide additional useful information to guide the intervention. For example, this advanced imaging modality could be used intraoperatively to localize a tumor, to help define the tumor margin, and to determine the margin status (positive or negative of tumor cells) and if any residual tumor remains. OCT is very suitable for this application, and can be adapted to the surgical environment to fulfill these current needs. OCT inherently satisfies many of the design requirements for an intraoperative imaging guidance tool, and can also readily be integrated into an existing surgical microscope or implemented as hand-held surgical imaging probes. Thus, the imaging capabilities of OCT permit the intra-operative guidance and monitoring of the surgical procedure, giving immediate imagebased feedback to the surgeon. There are two types of situations where OCT can potentially be used as an intraoperative imaging tool: (1) ex vivo imaging to assess the surgical margin on resected tissue, and (2) in vivo or in situ imaging of tissue before, during, and after surgical resection. Even though OCT image guidance can be applied to many types of surgical oncology procedures, here we introduce as a representative example the use of intraoperative OCT in breast cancer surgery, which has been an emerging surgical application of OCT. Intraoperative OCT can also be used in other solid tumor surgeries including those for brain, lung, liver, kidney, thyroid, pancreatic, and colon cancers, among many others. \n\nIn the past, a standard surgical procedure to treat breast cancers was radical mastectomy. Currently, a breast conserving lumpectomy procedure is often the preferred surgical treatment, with the goal to leave the natural appearance and cosmetic quality of the breast mostly intact while removing the cancerous tissue. After the lumpectomy, the resected tumor mass and tissue are sent to a pathologist, where the margin status is determined using most commonly H&E stained histology and light microscopy. Depending on the institution and how much breast tissue is conserved, relative to the tumor tissue, positive margin and re-operation rates can be as high as 40% [58].",

Jung, S. Boppart\n## Abstract\nIn pathology, histological examination of the \u201cgold standard\u201d to diagnose various diseases. It has contributed significantly toward identifying the abnormalities in tissues and cells, but has inherent drawbacks when used for fast and accurate diagnosis. These limitations include the lack of in vivo observation in real time and sampling errors due to limited number and area coverage of tissue sections. Its diagnostic yield also varies depending on the ability of the physician and the effectiveness of any image guidance technique that may be used for tissue screening during excisional biopsy. In order to overcome these current limitations of histology-based diagnostics, there are significant needs for either complementary or alternative imaging techniques which perform non-destructive, high resolution, and rapid tissue screening. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging imaging modality which allows real-time cross-sectional imaging with high resolutions that approach those of histology. OCT could be a very promising technique which has the potential to be used as an adjunct to histological tissue observation when it is not practical to take specimens for histological processing, when large areas of tissue need investigating, or when rapid microscopic imaging is needed. This review will describe the use of OCT as an image guidance tool for fast tissue screening and directed histological tissue sectioning in pathology.\n## Intraoperative image guidance using OCT\nA surgical microscope is routinely used to guide delicate surgery by magnifying the surface features of tissue. The development of advanced imaging techniques capable of high resolution and real time visualization of sub-surface tissue structure could provide additional useful information to guide the intervention. For example, this advanced imaging modality could be used intraoperatively to localize a tumor, to help define the tumor margin, and to determine the margin status (positive or negative of tumor cells) and if any residual tumor remains. OCT is very suitable for this application, and can be adapted to the surgical environment to fulfill these current needs. OCT inherently satisfies many of the design requirements for an intraoperative imaging guidance tool, and can also readily be integrated into an existing surgical microscope or implemented as hand-held surgical imaging probes. Thus, the imaging capabilities of OCT permit the intra-operative guidance and monitoring of the surgical procedure, giving immediate imagebased feedback to the surgeon. There are two types of situations where OCT can potentially be used as an intraoperative imaging tool: (1) ex vivo imaging to assess the surgical margin on resected tissue, and (2) in vivo or in situ imaging of tissue before, during, and after surgical resection. Even though OCT image guidance can be applied to many types of surgical oncology procedures, here we introduce as a representative example the use of intraoperative OCT in breast cancer surgery, which has been an emerging surgical application of OCT. Intraoperative OCT can also be used in other solid tumor surgeries including those for brain, lung, liver, kidney, thyroid, pancreatic, and colon cancers, among many others. \n\nIn the past, a standard surgical procedure to treat breast cancers was radical mastectomy. Currently, a breast conserving lumpectomy procedure is often the preferred surgical treatment, with the goal to leave the natural appearance and cosmetic quality of the breast mostly intact while removing the cancerous tissue. After the lumpectomy, the resected tumor mass and tissue are sent to a pathologist, where the margin status is determined using most commonly H&E stained histology and light microscopy. Depending on the institution and how much breast tissue is conserved, relative to the tumor tissue, positive margin and re-operation rates can be as high as 40% [58].",

A suitable treatment for early stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery (BCS) [2,3]. \n\nFor breast-conserving treatment of NBC, an accurate intraoperative guidance is essential to achieve complete tumor removal with acceptable cosmetic results [4].

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided nonpalpable breast cancer lesion excision (IFNLE), to introduce an alternative technique.MethodsThe data about 56 patients with preoperatively diagnosed NBCs operated with the help of intraoperative IFNLE between November of 2010 and September of 2014 were retrospectively analyzed.ResultsICG fluorescence localized all lesions at surgery. Re-excision due to positive resection margins was necessary in two patients (3.6\u00a0%; 2/56) with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at the surgical margins. Mastectomy was necessary in one patient (1.8\u00a0%; 1/56) due to multifocal invasive carcinoma. The mean volume of the excised tissue was 38.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916.5\u00a0cm3.ConclusionsIFNLE is a technically applicable and clinically acceptable procedure whenever a breast cancer needs image-guided excision.\n## Background\nBreast cancer diagnosis has undergone a dramatic evolution in the last few decades. Due to the emergent availability in mammography screening programs, there has been a rapid increase in the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast cancer (NBC) to the breast surgeon [1]. Diagnosis is therefore more often made at an early stage, which is associated with decreased incidence of lymph node involvement. A suitable treatment for early stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery (BCS) [2,3]. \n\nFor breast-conserving treatment of NBC, an accurate intraoperative guidance is essential to achieve complete tumor removal with acceptable cosmetic results [4]. Traditionally, the surgical excision of this kind of lesion has been carried out with some methods; however, each technique suffers from various limitations [5][6][7]. Recently, a novel method of using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence has been described in breast surgery [8,9]. \n\nIn this article, we designed our study to evaluate the usefulness of ICG fluorescence-guided nonpalpable breast cancer lesion excision (IFNLE) and its results, to see whether the technique can be accepted as an alternative method of image guidance for the procedure.",

                    "text": "According to the latest report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were more than 2.26 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide in 2020, accounting for about 11.7% of all newly diagnosed cancers. \u22126 However, inadequate detection of breast tumor margins has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. Traditional surgery involves either incomplete removal of the tumor or unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. If the tumor is incomplete, additional tissue excision should be performed. However, this intraoperative evaluation is time-consuming and dependent on the experience of the surgeon. In fact, some studies have shown that about 20\u221250% of breast cancer patients have positive tumor margins after lumpectomy. 7 The presence of multiple positive margins is a risk factor for cancer recurrence and poor survival, and different surgical margins could have different prognostic roles. 8 So, before surgery, basic information such as the size, number, and location of the tumors inside the body has to be confirmed, which requires the imaging technique to have excellent spatial resolution and high sensitivity. 9,10 Other conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are generally difficult to integrate into the operating room. 11 Most importantly, these conventional imaging modalities cannot reliably communicate real-time feedback to the surgeon and have limited tumor specificity. 12 Thus, it is imperative to develop intraoperative imaging techniques to accurately delineate the tumor margin, and the imaging technique with superb sensitivity and prominent signal-to-background ratio is highly desirable intraoperatively. 13 o address this pressing clinical challenge, fluorescence image-guided surgery has emerged as a promising strategy for using fluorescence to highlight tumor tissue. \u221217 In recent years, it has received more and more attention in preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative guidance. However, existing fluorescence imaging methods still have some limitations. For example, indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration for visualization of human tumors, 18 but has been limited to slow blood clearance and lack of specificity. 19,20 herefore, it is urgent to develop targeted and safe contrast agents to guide the resection of cancer tumors.",

The results showed that Cy7-MO was well targeted to lysosomes. Importantly, the Cy7-MO probe was found to be well tolerable and exhibited excellent biocompatibility. Moreover, the orthotopic breast tumor margin was clearly visualized through fluorescence guiding of Cy7-MO. Finally, the correct tumor tissues were completely removed, and a negative margin was obtained successfully, which demonstrated an enhanced precision of surgery.\n## \u25a0 INTRODUCTION\nAccording to the latest report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were more than 2.26 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide in 2020, accounting for about 11.7% of all newly diagnosed cancers. \u22126 However, inadequate detection of breast tumor margins has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. Traditional surgery involves either incomplete removal of the tumor or unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. If the tumor is incomplete, additional tissue excision should be performed. However, this intraoperative evaluation is time-consuming and dependent on the experience of the surgeon. In fact, some studies have shown that about 20\u221250% of breast cancer patients have positive tumor margins after lumpectomy. 7 The presence of multiple positive margins is a risk factor for cancer recurrence and poor survival, and different surgical margins could have different prognostic roles. 8 So, before surgery, basic information such as the size, number, and location of the tumors inside the body has to be confirmed, which requires the imaging technique to have excellent spatial resolution and high sensitivity. 9,10 Other conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are generally difficult to integrate into the operating room. 11 Most importantly, these conventional imaging modalities cannot reliably communicate real-time feedback to the surgeon and have limited tumor specificity. 12 Thus, it is imperative to develop intraoperative imaging techniques to accurately delineate the tumor margin, and the imaging technique with superb sensitivity and prominent signal-to-background ratio is highly desirable intraoperatively. 13 o address this pressing clinical challenge, fluorescence image-guided surgery has emerged as a promising strategy for using fluorescence to highlight tumor tissue. \u221217 In recent years, it has received more and more attention in preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative guidance. However, existing fluorescence imaging methods still have some limitations. For example, indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration for visualization of human tumors, 18 but has been limited to slow blood clearance and lack of specificity. 19,20 herefore, it is urgent to develop targeted and safe contrast agents to guide the resection of cancer tumors.",

Beith\n## Abstract\nThis article provides an overview of the main controversies in a number of key areas of breast cancer management. Relevant studies that have contributed to guide the treatment of this heterogeneous disease in the field of breast screening, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are highlighted. Mammography and ultrasound are the main methods of breast screening. MRI and tomosynthesis are emerging as new screening tools for a selected group of breast cancer patients. From a surgical perspective, oncoplastic techniques and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are improving cosmetic results in breast-conserving surgery. For high-risk patients, controversies still remain regarding prophylactic mastectomies. Finally, the appropriate management of the axilla continues evolving with the increasing role of radiotherapy as an alternative treatment to axillary dissection.\n## Breast cancer screening (what are the controversies?)\nEarly breast cancer can be more effectively treated than advanced stages, when clinical signs and symptoms are present. Breast cancer screening allows detection of breast cancer in an asymptomatic phase and at an early stage. Different types of imaging and image-guided needle biopsies are used for breast screening.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the third most common cancer in the world after lung and colon , and overall the commonest cancer among women in India. Early detection and diagnosis help in providing early treatment to the patients thereby significantly impacting overall survival rate. The different imaging modalities at our disposal include ultrasonography, mammography and magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Over and above, nowadays with emergence of breast conservative surgery for early stage cancers the role of the radiologist in performing various imaging guided breast interventions is also evolving. Imaging guided breast biopsies, marker placement, stereotactic biopsy, wire localization are some of the commonly performed procedures by breast radiologists in addition to other pain and palliation measures as described later in the article. In this review / perspective article, therefore, we try to discuss the salient features of the common imaging modalities available for breast cancer detection and staging as well as explore the emerging role of imaging guided interventions for breast cancer in this era of multidisciplinary approach.",

            "text": "Introduction With the adoption of routine screening mammography, breast cancers are being diagnosed at earlier stages, with DCIS now accouting for 22.5% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. This has been attributed to both increased breast cancer awareness and improvements in breast imaging techniques. How have these changes, including the increased use of image-guided sampling techniques, influenced the clinical practice of breast surgery? Methods The institutional pathology database was queried for all breast surgeries, including breast reconstruction, performed in 1995 and 2005. Cosmetic procedures were excluded. The results were analysed utilizing the Chi-square test. Results Surgical indications changed during 10-year study period, with an increase in preoperatively diagnosed cancers undergoing definitive surgical management. ADH, and to a lesser extent, ALH, became indications for surgical excision. Fewer surgical biopsies were performed for indeterminate abnormalities on breast imaging, due to the introduction of stereotactic large core biopsy. While the rate of benign breast biopsies remained constant, there was a higher percentage of precancerous and DCIS cases in 2005. The overall rate of mastectomy decreased from 36.8% in 1995 to 14.5% in 2005. With the increase in sentinel node procedures, the rate of ALND dropped from 18.3% to 13.7%. Accompanying the increased recognition of early-stage cancers, the rate of positive ALND also decreased, from 43.3% to 25.0%. Conclusions While the rate of benign breast biopsies has remained constant over a recent 10-year period, fewer diagnostic surgical image-guided biopsies were performed in 2005. A greater percentage of patients with breast cancer or preinvasive disease have these diagnoses determined before surgery. More preinvasive and Stage 0 cancers are undergoing surgical management. Earlier stage invasive cancers are being detected, reflected by the lower incidence of axillary nodal metastases.",

            "text": "Background: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gained wide acceptance as the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer. One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat \u2018blind\u2019 approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this study is comparing ultrasound-guided vs palpation-guided conservative breast surgery in obtaining tumor-free resection margins. Methods: This study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial where patients with early breast cancer (T1-T2) and eligible for breast conserving surgery are randomly assigned (1:1) into two arms. Arm A: included the patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided breast conserving surgery. Arm B: included the patients who will undergo the conventional palpation-guided breast conserving surgery. Results: Overall, 142 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery were enrolled: 71 were allocated to the Ultrasound-guided (US) group (Arm A) and 71 to the Palpation-guided (PG) group (Arm B). Patient and tumor characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Age, Body mass index, tumor laterality, tumor location and tumor stage were comparable in both groups and statistically insignificant. Despite that the final tumor size was comparable between both groups, IOUS significantly reduced the main specimen volume and the least negative margin width (p<0.001). The median operative time was significantly longer in the US group bey around 27 min than in the PG group and this was statistically significant in favor of the PG surgery (p<0.001). The involved resection margin rate was significantly higher in the PG group and thus the need for reoperation (p<0.001). Conclusion: IOUS is the only method allowing a true real-time",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, with over 23,000 patients diagnosed in Canada each year. 1 The usual preoperative work-up for a suspected breast mass includes clinical breast and lymph node examination, mammography, breast ultrasound, and biopsy of the lesion in question. Following the pathologic confirmation, women with early-stage breast cancer are seen by their surgeon for a discussion regarding breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy. \n\nBreast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a more sensitive preoperative staging technique for detecting invasive breast cancer than mammography and/or breast ultrasound. 2 However, over the past few years, the introduction of preoperative breast MRI into the clinical setting has led to some controversy regarding its role in staging patients with early-stage breast cancer. \n\nYoung women (age less than or equal to 50 years) account for approximately 25% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. 3 These women tend to have breast cancers that are associated with a worse prognosis than their older counterparts, including higher local recurrence rates and worse overall survival. 4,5 One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that younger women tend to have higher risk tumor features, including larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, and a higher incidence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease. 6 In addition, most breast cancers in young women are identified by patients themselves, and they tend to present at a more advanced stage than women over the age of 50 years. 4 Young women also tend to have more fibroglandular breast tissue and a higher mammographic density, which makes it more difficult for mammography to differentiate normal breast tissue from a new breast cancer. 7 [10] In this retrospective study, we studied young women with early-stage breast cancer who underwent a preoperative bilateral breast MRI and asked surgeons what type of surgery they would recommend before and after being shown the breast MRI results. We hypothesized that the preoperative breast MRI in young women aged #50 years would result in a significant change in surgical recommendations.",

            "text": "Another intraoperative imaging modality for reducing rates of margin positivity at initial surgery is IOUS, which can be performed by surgeons who are increasingly ultrasound competent. In a prospective observational cohort study, Karalik et al [13] undertook BCS guided by either ultrasound (n = 84) or palpation (n = 80) amongst two groups of women matched for demographic and tumour characteristics. \n\nUse of IOUS reduced the rate of re-excision from 17% for palpation-guided lumpectomy to only 6% with IOUS. (p = 0.03). Moreover, the volume of tissue resected in the palpation-guided group was significantly higher despite comparable tumour size (p = 0.048) and equivalent cosmetic outcomes. \n\nThe COBALT study is a prospective multicentre trial which addressed the hypothesis that use of IOUS for wide local excision of palpable breast cancers could potentially spare healthy tissue and improve both surgical margin status and cosmesis. The trial was conducted in the Netherlands, but accrued a relatively small number of patients in relation to the number of centres and participating surgeons. Notwithstanding this comment, the trial had 80% power to detect an 18% reduction in the re-excision rates. A total of 134 patients with palpable early stage primary invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-1) were randomised to either ultrasound-guided surgery (USS) or palpation-guided surgery (PGS). Some patients had invasive tumour associated with DCIS, which influenced rates of margin positivity. Nonetheless, use of ultrasound significantly increased the negative margin rate from 83% (PGS) to 94% (USS) (p = 0.03). Moreover, specimen volumes at first excision were significantly lower for the USS group compared with the PGS group (p = 0.048). The trial contained a quality-of-life sub-study and also examined cosmetic outcomes [14]. \n\nAnother familiar imaging modality is MRI which can be used for specimen radiography; however, this methodology within the context of surgical excision specimens is impractical, time consuming and unlikely to be cost-effective in any managed healthcare system.",

            "text": "Between June 2003 and February 2011, 986 patients with invasive breast cancer underwent BCS at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. A total of 726 of these were pathologically confirmed with early-stage breast cancer (pathologic T stage I and II) after surgery. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those with distant metastasis were excluded. We thus retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 701 patients; 10 of these patients had bilateral breast cancer and underwent bilateral BCS, giving a total of 711 cases of BCS. This study was approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB No. B-1203/148-112). \n\nAge, body mass index (BMI), clinical T and N stage, and palpability were recorded and analyzed. Clinical stage was evaluated by physical examination and radiologic findings were obtained from electronic medical records. We classified mammographic findings into 4 categories: no visualization, mass, microcalcification, and mass with microcalcification. We identified the presence of daughter nodules by ultrasonography (USG) and non-mass-like enhancement (NMLE) by breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From pathologic reports, we obtained the pathologic stage, histologic type and nuclear grade, pathologic multifocality, hormone receptor status, presence of DCIS and LVI, tumor border type, and resection margin width in 4 directions (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral). Breast cancer staging was based on the seventh staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/ International Union against Cancer [15]. \n\nAll operations were performed under general anesthesia by one specialized breast cancer surgeon. Palpable tumors were excised with the acceptable margin width of more than 1 cm by intraoperative palpation. Non-palpable tumors were marked by USG-guided or MMG-guided needle localization before surgery. In some cases with non-palpable tumors, specimen mammography was performed to confirm the adequate resection. The intraoperative frozen section for resection margin evaluation was not performed routinely. Re-excision was performed for patients with a positive or close resection margins ( > 0 to \u2264 2 mm) microscopically.",

Conserving surgery was suggested for the majority of women with stage I or II early breast cancer or with a maximum cancer diameter of less than 4 cm after review of all imaging data, including MRI data (2,18). The expected percentage of residual breast volume after wide excision and the patient's preferences were also considered. Subareolar tumors (23 cases) were approached by central excision with or without resection of the nipple areolar complex depending on the tumor involvement. Palpable tumors (152 cases) were excised with the acceptable margin width of more than 1 cm by intraoperative palpation without any image guidance. Non-palpable malignant lesions (94 cases) were routinely guided by breast radiologists using ultrasound-or mammography-guided hookwire needle localization. Ultrasound-guided needle localization was performed in 77 cases and mammography-guided needle localization was performed in 17 cases. In some cases with non-palpable tumors, specimen mammography was performed to confirm adequate resection. Intraoperative frozen sections for evaluation of the resection margins were not routinely collected. Pathology reports included size, histologic grade, and surgical margin status. Margins were classified as involved (positive) or clear. Involved margins were defined as those with tumor cells less than 2 mm from the inked margin in invasive breast cancer, and",

In national surveys, approximately 75% of American women 40 years of age and older report having undergone mammography within the last two years (Smigal et al. 2006;Ryerson et al. 2007). Currently ductal carcinoma in situ accounts for 22.5% of newly diagnosed breast cancers (Smigal et al. 2006), while in 1990, it accounted for only 2% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers (Adamovich and Simmons, 2003;Esserman, 2006). The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 212,920 new cases of invasive breast cancer, and 61,980 cases of in situ disease would be diagnosed in the United States in the year 2006 (Smigal et al. 2006). This shift has additionally been attributed to improvements in breast imaging techniques, including the increased use of image-guided sampling techniques, and most recently, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the breast (Goethem et al. 2006).\n\nIn addition, surgical practice has changed dramatically as well over the last decade, particularly with the widespread adoption of the sentinel node technique for axillary staging (Kim et al. 2005), and refi nements in breast reconstruction techniques.\n\nHow have these changes infl uenced the clinical practice of breast surgery?

The histological results of interventional procedures guided by ultrasound, stereotactic mammography or magnetic resonance have to be integrated in planning surgical resec- tion margins in oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery. Image-guided wire markings are an important tool for planning these surgical resection margins.

            "text": "The remarkable evolution of breast cancer surgery from the radical mastectomy advocated by William Halsted to cosmetically appealing breast conservation has been championed by women and pioneering surgeons, 1 and the safety and benefits of this approach have ultimately been confirmed through high-level scientific evidence. Randomized trials and subsequent experience with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) have clearly established its efficacy, with a low, long-term risk of local (in-breast) recurrence, typically 0.5% to 1% per year. The increasing adoption of performing preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in women newly diagnosed with early stage (stage I and II) breast cancer, for the purpose of identifying additional (occult) foci of disease within the affected breast, has been based on assumptions that MRI's detection capability in this setting will improve surgical treatment (and, hence, outcomes) in the absence of evidence of incremental clinical benefit. These assumptions, which are further discussed in relation to available evidence, are that: (1) preoperative MRI will improve surgical planning (or precision), thus leading to a reduction in re-excision surgery, and (2) MRI will reduce in-breast recurrences by guiding surgical intervention for MRI-detected additional disease. \n\nEmerging data show that this approach to local staging of the breast leads to more women being treated with mastectomy without improvement in surgical outcomes or prognosis. Thus, it is timely and imperative to consider both current evidence and a way forward in determining the role of preoperative MRI. We review the data on breast MRI in women newly affected by breast cancer, highlighting the evidence on its potential benefit and associated harm, and discuss implications for management of women with early stage disease. We systematically discuss each of the key issues relevant to addressing the clinical question raised in the title of our article, based on summaries of published data, complemented by our perspectives on the evidence in the context of contemporary standards of care in breast cancer.",

In 234 of the 3,208 patients (7%), additional suspicious lesions were detected and the location of lesions could affect the method of the breast cancer surgery. Because the surgeons prefer US-guided procedures due to the lack of wait time, we considered second-look US ahead of MR-guided VAB to verify the lesion's identity; MR-guided VAB was only recommended when it was difficult to localize the lesion with US. Therefore, second-look US was recommended in 187 patients (80%, 187/234) and MR-guided breast VAB was recommended in 47 patients (20%, 47/234). Among them, 22 patients (9%, 22/234) underwent MR-guided breast VABs. All patients were Korean. Figure 1 shows a flowchart for the 3,208 patients who underwent preoperative breast MR imaging. \n\nThe index cancers were documented pathologically prior to the definitive therapy.

Despite these findings, mastectomy remains the most prevalent surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer in many parts of the world. In Iran, BCS is an uncommon modality for this condition. For example, in one study in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 386 breast cancer patients were reviewed and mastectomy was found to be the most prevalent surgical treatment [6]. Similarly, in another study in Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 348 breast cancer patients of whom 50% had stage I or stage II breast cancer were evaluated, and it was found that only 22 patients underwent BCS [7]. \n\nIt is argued that one factor influencing choice of treatment in breast cancer patients is the attitude of the operating surgeon. There is evidence that most women follow surgeons' recommendations, their primary source of information about treatment options. Studies have shown that surgeons recommended a specific treatment option in 69% of cases; in 89% of these cases they offered mastectomy and in 11% BCS. The rates of compliance with these recommendations were reported to be 93% and 89% respectively [8]. \n\nThe present study was designed to evaluate the preferences of surgeons in Iran regarding breast cancer treatment and the factors influencing the type of treatment recommended.",

            "text": "Breast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

            "text": "Breast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women [1]. A successful BC treatment is based on a multidisciplinary use of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with surgery as the central component of treatment for early-stage breast cancer [2,3]. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, known as breast conservation therapy (BCT), has become the alternative treatment to mastectomy for early stage breast cancer because of equivalent survival and lower morbidity [4][5][6]. \n\nLocal recurrence after BCS is strongly correlated to the surgical margin status, as demonstrated by a large number of follow-up studies [7][8][9][10][11]. The main goal of BCS is to fully remove the tumor with clear margins, while avoiding resection of healthy breast tissue in order to achieve better cosmetic results. Image-guided preoperative localization is mandatory for guiding surgery of non-palpable lesions or surgically relevant extension of palpable lesions to improve both oncological and cosmetic outcomes [12,13]. Over the last decade, methods for preoperative localization of breast lesions for BCS have evolved rapidly due to innovative techniques and discovery of novel agents. However, cooperation and communication between breast surgeons and radiologists still play a crucial role. \n\nDifferent image guided localization techniques are variably used in different institutions depending on personal choices, skills and available technologies. As a general rule, the method chosen should be the most precise to localize the lesion or marker left after biopsy, thus improving free margin rates and decreasing operative time, and possibly cause little to no discomfort to the patient. Preoperative breast lesions localization techniques currently available are wire localization, carbon marking, radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL), radioactive seed localization (RSL), magnetic seed localization and non-radioactive radar localization, intraoperative ultrasound and preoperative skin tattoo localization (Table 1). In this article, we provide an overview of current literature of all commercially available techniques.",

            "text": "Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gained wide acceptance as the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer. One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. Positive or focally positive margins for tumor cells are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, and in case of tumor-positive margins, re-excision or even mastectomy are often required to achieve negative margins. (1,2,3,4)   In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by pre-operative imaging and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat 'blind' approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. (4,5,6,7)   High-frequency real-time ultrasonography was introduced in the 1970's and the technology has steadily improved, resulting in increased sensitivity, greater portability and the availability of ultrasonography in the operation theatre. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and it has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer. (8,9,10,11)   Considering the advantages when applied to nonpalpable masses, ultrasound-guided surgery for palpable breast cancer should similarly decrease margin positivity and excision volumes. \n\nThe following study is a randomized controlled study aiming to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided surgery in palpable breast cancer with the standard palpation-guided surgery in obtaining tumor free resection margins.",

            "text": "Surgical management of BC primarily focuses on techniques such as BCS and mastectomy. BCS commonly known as lumpectomy, is the standard procedure for early-stage BC, allowing tumor removal while preserving as much breast tissue as possible (43). This approach significantly improves cosmetic outcomes and patient quality of life (45). Accurate localization of tumors during BCS continues to present significant challenges, particularly in cases involving small or nonpalpable lesions. This difficulty can result in incomplete tumor excision and elevated rates of re-excision (43). \n\nRecent advancements in surgical methodologies and technologies have been directed toward improving the precision of BC surgeries. Notably, the integration of fiber-optic photoacoustic guidance with augmented reality has demonstrated potential in enhancing tumor localization accuracy during surgical procedures, thereby potentially decreasing the necessity for re-excision (43). Advanced imaging techniques, such as quantitative micro-elastography and Cerenkov luminescence imaging, are being explored for their ability to identify residual cancer in the surgical cavity in real-time, potentially improving surgical results (47,49). \n\nIn parallel, the management of axillary lymph nodes is undergoing significant transformation, with a discernible trend toward minimally invasive surgical approaches. The transition from routine axillary clearance to SLNB marks a pivotal shift, contributing to reduced morbidity and improved patient quality of life (45). This is particularly significant as a growing number of early-stage BC patients benefit from personalized treatment strategies that reduce invasiveness while ensuring effective cancer management (45). \n\nThe approach to treating ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is undergoing changes. Studies indicate that many patients undergoing BCS for DCIS may face a second breast event, necessitating further surgical procedures (44). Comprehending the patterns of care and treatment modalities for SBE is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and informing future clinical practices (44). \n\nThe surgical management of BC is undergoing constant evolution, driven by ongoing research and technological advancements that seek to enhance precision, minimize complications, and improve the overall patient experience (46,48,50).",

            "text": "With the introduction of screening programs for breast cancer, the median tumor size has greatly decreased. More than onethird of breast cancers are estimated to be nonpalpable in surgical practice. 1 Breastconserving surgery (BCS), which is as safe and effective as mastectomy, has become a common surgical modality for early breast cancer. 2 The incidence of inadequate (close or positive) excision margins ranges from 5% to 60%. 3 Patients sometimes agree to undergo re-excision to reduce the recurrence rate of ipsilateral breast cancer and obtain clear pathologic margins. \n\nVarious localization methods are used to obtain adequate surgical margins, including wire-guided, palpation-guided, and radioguided excision. 4 Wire-guided excision is the current treatment method for nonpalpable breast cancers. The surgeon's experience and the radiologist's accuracy in guidewire placement will influence the resection of nonpalpable breast cancer. Wireguided excision is frequently inadequate; approximately 20% of patients still need to undergo a second surgical treatment despite the breast cancer being diagnosed before surgery. 5 Additionally, preoperative placement of a guidewire is uncomfortable for the patient, which increases the patient's anxiety about the operation. 6 ltrasound (US) has been extensively applied to image-guided breast biopsy procedures. 7,8 Intraoperative US was first used as an alternative means to detect nonpalpable breast cancers in BCS in the late 1980s. 9 The surgeon can use US to visually remove the nonpalpable malignancy and obtain adequate margins. 10 The security and feasibility of this method have been tested by several groups, but only a few patients were included, and the advantages of US-guided BCS remain controversial. 11,12 The aim of this study was to compare the margin clearance and re-excision rates of wire-and US-guided BCS in a large number of patients with nonpalpable breast cancer.",

            "text": "The need for identification and targeting of tumours has increasingly grown to be one of the most important areas of medicine. This had led to the growth and advancement of radiology techniques. Over time, these techniques have iteratively become more accurate, multifunctional and provided increased ease to patients. Biopsies are essential to both diagnosis and treatment of oncological pathologies. Existing measures have provided excellent ways of diagnosing and treating patients; however, success rates can be limited depending on the technique. Further advances are being made to help improve patient comfort, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment. \n\nSeveral techniques are currently being employed in healthcare settings to identify, biopsy, and treat cancers. The most common image-guided biopsy methods are computed tomography (CT)-and ultrasound (US)guided biopsies. CT guidance is particularly good for deeper tissue biopsies and higher accuracy. US-guided biopsies are typically better for softer tissues that are relatively superficial. For example, typically biopsies located near the bones are conducted with the aid of CT guidance; however, breast biopsies are performed under the guidance of US. \n\nIn addition to CT-and US-guided biopsies, other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsies, are used. MRI-guided biopsy indications include non-palpable breast lesions as well as central nervous system (CNS) lesions, which can be better visualized with MRI. This review explores the effectiveness of traditional biopsy methods and compares them to more recent advances in image-guided tissue sampling. accuracy,\" \"PET/CT US fusion-guided biopsy,\" \"novel image-guided biopsy techniques,\" \"fusion-guided biopsy,\" \"SWE diagnostic accuracy,\" \"augmented reality biopsies,\" \"molecular breast imaging biopsy diagnostic accuracy,\" \"robot-assisted biopsies,\" and \"liquid biopsies.\" Inclusion criteria focused on studies that provided clear distinctions in outcomes related to different biopsy techniques and advancements, while excluding those lacking sufficient data on diagnostic outcomes or clinical application.",

            "text": "BCT is a local treatment that can preserve noncancerous breast tissue, achieve better cosmetic results, reduce tissue damage, and reduce complications. [27][28] However, the survival benefit of BCT has been controversial in recent years with long-term follow-up and improved local radiation therapy, especially for young women with early-stage breast cancer. This study analyzed cases (obtained from the SEER database) of breast surgery performed on young women with early-stage breast cancer in a cohort of women representing the United States' general population. \n\nIn this study, among young women with breast cancer, patients with a higher tumor burden, such as larger tumor size, higher pathological grade, and hormone receptor-negative diseases, were prone to receive mastectomy. Meanwhile, younger patients were more likely to undergo mastectomy. This is likely because breast cancer in young patients tends to have more aggressive features and occurs at a more advanced stage. 0]22,29] Notably, in 2005, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's (NCCN) guidelines for breast cancer recommended an age below 35 as an indication for mastectomy. Therefore, young patients during that era may have undergone mastectomy rather than BCT based on the findings from these studies. Additionally, young patients are more likely to participate vigorously in medical decisions. Moreover, fear of relapse, anxiety related to long-term monitoring, and the fact that long-term radiotherapy will interfere with daily activities may lead them to choose mastectomy, which is considered a more aggressive treatment. [30,31] ver the past several decades, an increasing number of patients with early-stage breast cancer have been diagnosed with the improvement of optimal screening strategies, especially for older patients. However, in young patients, sensitive methods for screening early-stage breast cancer still need to be investigated. This study included young women with stage I and II breast cancer. The trends of key characteristic ratios have been stable over the past 3 decades in young women. This finding is consistent with previous studies. [32,33] To reduce the incidence and mortality of early-stage breast cancer in young patients, new methods for screening, early detection, and prevention should be considered. \n\nIn contrast, the proportions of breast conservation over the years appear to fluctuate.",

            "text": "These innovations have facilitated more precise and efficient surgical procedures, ultimately resulting in improved patient outcomes. \n\nAugmented reality (AR) technology has become increasingly popular in breast cancer surgeries, providing precise and efficient outcomes as demonstrated in several studies. L Lan et al. [69] developed a fiber optoacoustic guide (FOG) with AR for precise and efficient breast cancer surgery, as illustrated in Figure 10. The FOG was implanted in the tumor and transmitted acoustic waves, which were captured by ultrasound sensors to provide real-time visual feedback to the surgeon via AR, allowing for accurate and quick tumor removal with minimal interference. The successful implementation of this technology in a cadaver study demonstrated the potential for reduced re-operation rates and shorter surgery times. Advancements in 3D spatial technology and AR, powered by high-tech computer science, have rapidly progressed breast cancer imaging and led to the creation of less invasive medical procedures. P F Gouveia et al. [70] presented the first use of digital, non-invasive AR for breast cancer surgery, with a 57-year-old woman undergoing breast surgery using AR for localization, as presented in Figure 11. The method was compared with traditional carbon tattooing, with the surgeon using a Hololens headset for visualization. The experiment showed a successful overlap of previous marks and visualization of the tumor. B Allison et al. [71] presented Breast3D, a mammographic image analysis system that utilizes extended reality (XR) technology to reconstruct CT and MRI scan data for breast cancer diagnosis and surgical planning. Breast3D provides a promising solution for XR within diagnostics of 3D mammographic modalities, which has been underutilized in the past. Moreover, H H Chan et al. [72] developed a new AR surgical positioning system that enhances visualization of concealed anatomy during surgery by projecting virtual images onto the operative site, demonstrating the clinical adaptability and pinpoint precision of the AR surgical navigation system with accuracy tested to be <1mm using a phantom (Figure 12).",

            "text": "The use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. MRI has greater sensitivity than other imaging modalities for the screening of women at higher risk of breast cancer, with more than half of lesions only detected on MRI (1,2). MRI can identify primary cancer in suspected occult breast cancer patients (3). In addition, breast MRI most accurately depicts the extent of breast cancer (4)(5)(6). Although the clinical relevance of additional lesions is still controversial, preoperative MRI identifies more synchronous, ipsilateral or contralateral breast cancers than mammography and ultrasound (7)(8)(9). However, breast MRI has limited specificity (10). If a suspicious lesion is detected, biopsy is mandatory to avoid unnecessary surgery. In addition, biopsy under MRI guidance is required for suspected occult lesions on mammography or ultrasound. \n\nThe American College of Radiology requires performance of MRI-guided intervention or contact with available referral site when performing breast MRI (11). The MRI guideline of the European Society of Breast Imaging also emphasizes the necessity of offering MRI-guided intervention at a site performing breast MRI (12). The number of medical centers providing breast MRI is growing in Korea, and more MRI-guided breast biopsies are required. However, few reports describe MRI-guided breast biopsy in Korea (13,14). In this article, we describe preprocedural considerations and technique, and correlation of radiologic and pathologic findings in MRI-guided breast biopsy.",

            "text": "Simple Summary The effectiveness of neoadjuvant treatment has led to an expansion of its indications from locally advanced to highly chemo-sensitive early-stage breast cancers, aiming to increase conservative treatments, in place of more invasive surgery, and to improve long term outcomes. At the same time, the continuous development of diagnostic techniques necessitates continuous updating, due to their importance in tumoral staging and in the prediction of the response to treatment, as well as in surgical planning. With our review, we sought to discuss the strengths of the various imaging modalities; in particular, the role of magnetic resonance imaging, which is still the center of scientific debate in this setting. Moreover, we analyzed the evolution of surgical approaches to breast cancer in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Abstract Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) today represents a cornerstone in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer and highly chemo-sensitive tumors at early stages, increasing the possibilities of performing more conservative treatments and improving long term outcomes. Imaging has a fundamental role in the staging and prediction of the response to NACT, thus aiding surgical planning and avoiding overtreatment. In this review, we first examine and compare the role of conventional and advanced imaging techniques in preoperative T Staging after NACT and in the evaluation of lymph node involvement. In the second part, we analyze the different surgical approaches, discussing the role of axillary surgery, as well as the possibility of non-operative management after-NACT, which has been the subject of recent trials. Finally, we focus on emerging techniques that will change the diagnostic assessment of breast cancer in the near future.",

            "text": "reast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among adult women in Canada, and the absolute number of new cases identified each year is increasing as a result of our growing and aging population. 1 Fortunately, owing to the implementation of organized screening programs, most women will be diagnosed with early-stage disease (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], stage I or stage II breast cancer) 1,2 and will be treated successfully with primary surgery plus adjuvant radiation and/or systemic therapies where applicable. In Alberta, the 5-year relative survival for ductal carcinoma in situ and stage I breast cancer is 100%, and for stage II breast cancer it is 95%. 3 As breast cancer is an important public health concern, opportunities to promote value-based care should be prioritized. 4,5 ][8][9][10] The likelihood of having radiologically evident distant disease is low, [11][12][13] and hence use of routine staging tests would rarely change the therapeutic plan or alter outcomes. ][19][20][21][22] The issue of unnecessary imaging for metastases in early breast cancer was highlighted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in their inaugural Top Five list, which was released on Apr. 4, 2012, in response to the American Board of Internal Medicine's Choosing Wisely campaign. 23 Subsequently, the Alberta Health Services clinical practice guideline on breast cancer staging was updated. 8 The recommendation for routine bone scanning in the setting of stage II disease was removed and the Alberta Provincial Tumour Team on behalf of Alberta Health Services endorsed the prior recommendation that routine abdominal imaging for DCIS and stage I and II breast cancer was not required. We therefore hypothesized that the utilization of routine staging tests in the setting of early breast cancer would decrease over time. The aim of this study was to report on the use of advanced imaging tests among women diagnosed with DCIS and stage I and stage II breast cancer between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31,  2015, in Alberta.",

            "text": "The object of the study was to conduct a systematic literature review on combined modality treatment for early-stage breast cancer using postoperative and intraoperative radiation therapy, and consider new treatment approaches for early breast cancer.Material and Methods. The search for sources relevant to the review topic was carried out in the Medline, Cochrane Library, and Elibrary systems. A total of 905 studies on combination treatments for early breast cancer were identified, of which 43 were included in the review.Results. Data analysis showed that the rate of local relapses in early breast cancer was lower in patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery in combination with adjuvant radiation therapy than in patients without adjuvant radiation therapy. Research is ongoing on radiotherapy deintensification using intraoperative radiation therapy for patients at low risk of recurrence. Ongoing clinical trials support the omission of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for elderly women with hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer, who receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. Understanding the characteristics of the tumor process will allow us to personalize the treatment of patients with early breast cancer, reduce the risk of local relapses, and avoid unnecessary treatment-related complications.Conclusion. To improve survival in breast cancer patients is only possible by maximizing the tumor control. The effectiveness of adjuvant radiation therapy, which is an integral component in the combined modality treatment of early breast cancer, has been proven. However, third-generation studies discuss the feasibility of identifying a low-risk group of patients with a favorable clinical prognosis, who receive adequate endocrine therapy, and additional radiation do not provide a significant survival benefit.",

            "text": "In contrast, the 5-year survival rate dropped significantly to just 59% for patients diagnosed with tumors larger than 2 cm [5]. \n\nThe 5-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer (stage I) was 99%, but only 86% for regional-stage (stage II/III) and 27% for distant-stage (stage IV) disease [6]. This was based on a large-scale analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in the United States. This dramatic difference in survival underscores the critical importance of early detection, as tumors detected at an earlier, more localized stage are far more treatable and associated with better outcomes [7]. \n\nFurthermore, prompt initiation of treatment following diagnosis is also a crucial factor in improving patient survival [7]. Independent of tumor size and other prognostic factors, a study in the Annals of Surgical Oncology found that a delay of more than 60 days between diagnosis and treatment start was associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality [8]. \n\nBreast cancer detection relies on a variety of imaging modalities, each with its own strengths and limitations. The most used technique is mammography, which utilizes low-dose X-rays to create images of the breast [9,10]. For decades, mammography has served as the cornerstone of breast cancer screening, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting early-stage tumors and lowering mortality rates [11]. However, women with dense breast tissue can reduce the sensitivity of mammography, leading to a higher rate of false-negative results [12]. To address the limitations of mammography, healthcare providers often employ additional imaging modalities, such as ultrasound imaging, to create real-time images of the breast, providing valuable information about the composition and structure of suspicious lesions [13]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [14,15], single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) are other imaging modalities that can help find cancerous tumors [16]. \n\nWhile these advanced imaging modalities offer improved diagnostic capabilities, they are often more expensive and time-consuming and may not be as widely accessible as traditional mammography [14].",

With these techniques, a BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) score from 1 to 6 is given to suspicious lesions on each breast, which dictates the following steps [13,14]. This score was implemented to reduce the variability among radiologists when creating reports, regarding not only mammography but also ultrasound and MRI [15,16]. \n\nAnother important tool for monitoring is the MRI and additionally the use of contrast, which improves the method's sensibility [12]. US-guided biopsy has a lower risk of complications compared to surgery and can evaluate non-palpable breast lesions [17]. Furthermore, it can improve the quality of life, being a less invasive procedure than surgery [3]. \n\nThis literature review presents the algorithm and intends to show the most advantageous ways to use and link the existing imaging methods to improve both the management and outcome of patients with breast cancer, from suspicion and diagnosis to posttherapy surveillance and follow ups. The main imaging techniques and their clinical applications were summarized to find the best way to manage breast cancer patients.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is a major threat to women worldwide, and early detection and diagnosis are critical to improving cure rates and reducing mortality [1]. Breast cancer has complex and diverse causes, including environmental factors, hormone secretion, and life stress [2]. At the molecular level, breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that involves DNA damage, genetic mutations (such as BRCA gene mutations), activation of hormone receptors (progesterone and estrogen receptors), and expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing breast cancer mortality rates in the long term. Identifying early stage breast cancer is essential for achieving optimal prognosis [3], with imaging examinations being an important means for diagnosis in the early stages. \n\nBreast ultrasound is a non-radiation clinical modality that is well tolerated by patients and is widely used in the diagnosis of breast cancer [4,5]. However, its accuracy depends on the expertise of the clinician, which can lead to misdiagnosis [6]. Other diagnostic modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography, computed tomography, digital breast tomosynthesis and positron emission topography, are also used, but have technical limitations [7]. To address these challenges, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms, based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, can assist medical staff in accurately interpreting images. This tool has the potential to improve patient outcomes by guiding clinicians to correct diagnoses [8,9]. Breast ultrasound classification is crucial for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumours. Segmentation, which divides an image into regions to identify regions of interest (ROI), is a critical notion in image processing. However, segmentation can be problematic and lead to misdiagnosis, for example, when pectoral muscles are present but not part of the breast tissue [10,11]. Therefore, it's important to compare identified cancer ultrasound images with the standard Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from a clinical perspective. BI-RADS provides standardised terms, known as a lexicon, that describe the characteristics of breast masses and effectively differentiate between benign and malignant tumours [12].",

Today, with the advancement of science and new disease screening methods, breast cancer is diagnosed in the earlier stages of the disease, however, in patients with advanced stages, the risk of metastasis to further body parts will increase as well (13). According to a large epidemiological study in Iran, 65.5%-70.5% of patients are diagnosed in the early stages (stage 1 or 2) and less than 30% in advanced stages (14). Today, in the early stages of the disease, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is preferred over modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (15,16). In addition, patients have shown more satisfaction regarding psychological and beauty aspects (17). \n\nSeveral studies have been conducted about breast cancer, including the following studies, the study by Bakhtiari et al., states that breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in the North of Iran, with a rate of 9.24% (18). The study of Enayat Rad et al., on the topic of examining the prosses of breast cancer's changes of Iranian women in 2016 in the city of Tehran, which indicates the increase of breast cancer in population of women in the country (19). A study conducted by Lima et al., in Colombia with the aim of the global emergence of breast cancer and mortality rates, based on region, age, and fertility patterns indicated that breast cancer has an increasing pattern in all age groups and the rate of breast cancer mortality has increased by 0.23% per year, which was significant in age groups under 50 years and 70 years and older (20).

            "text": "Breast cancer is one of the leading malignancies causing death in women and accounted for 30% of new cancer cases in women in 2021 with an increase of still 0.5% per year [1]. It is called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) because of the absence of the expression of the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor. TNBC accounts for about 15-20% of all breast cancer cases [2,3]. Compared to other subtypes, TNBC occurs at a relatively low age while at the same time being highly aggressive. Patients are prone to metastasis and recurrence and have a poor prognosis [4][5][6]. The intervention of surgical and cytotoxic treatment enhances the survival rate of patients [7], data has shown that the 5-year survival rate after surgery for early-stage patients can be as high as 91% while the overall survival of patients who have metastatic TNBC is only about 18 months [8][9][10]. Therefore, the early diagnosis and timely treatment are significant with regard to a better prognosis and survival rate of this patient group. \n\nChemotherapy holds an invaluable role in controlling the progression of breast cancer. While surgery is the preferred option for most patients with early-stage TNBC, preperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in reduced tumor size, less difficult surgery and significantly lower postoperative recurrence rates which is correlated to disease-free survival and overall survival time [11]. Alternatively, chemotherapy provides the main treatment strategy for patients in advanced stages [12]. There is a rapid development of drug research for the treatment of TNBC during recent, however, the benefit of one particular treatment regimen varies from individuals due to the heterogeneity of tumor cells and expressed tumor markers [13]. Hence, real-time and accurate assessment of the treatment response would result in a more reliable judgement of chemotherapy efficiency and is therefore vital to guide further cancer treatment decisions. The most commonly used imaging tools to assess the dynamic changes of breast cancer are MRI and CT [14].",

            "text": "For the analysis of the distribution of cases according to the stage of the disease, the p-TNM staging indicated by the histopathological examination was used. In the present study, most cases were diagnosed in stage III disease (35.2%) and only 9.6% of cases were diagnosed in the early stages of carcinoma in situ. The early stages at the time of diagnosis have the advantage of a more favorable prognosis and benefit from much less invasive treatments. The diagnosis of breast cancer in advanced stages can be explained by the lack of national screening programs, low level of education on maintaining health and the importance of self-examination, and difficult access to medical services and treatments. Thus, late diagnosis has major consequences on the survival rate and quality of life, correlating with more invasive treatments (5,6). \n\nBreast cancer biopsy is the gold standard for pathological evaluation guiding the therapeutic conduct for each case. In the present study group, of the 125 cases, 55 (44%) received a biopsy at our department, while for the remaining patients the biopsy was performed in other departments, prior to admission. The types of biopsies performed included incisional, excisional biopsy, most patients benefited from incisional biopsy (36.4%), followed by excisional biopsy (23.6%). Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy (21.8%) and fine needle aspiration biopsy (18.2%) were also used (Table I). This result coincided with data from the literature, incisional biopsy being indicated if the lesion was highly likely to be malignant or could not be reached through needle biopsy. However, while surgical methods of biopsy have a higher degree of accuracy, they also have a higher degree of complications, such as bleeding or infection compared to needle biopsy (7,8). \n\nRecent findings, however, have shown that imaging-guided percutaneous breast biopsies have almost completely replaced diagnostic surgical excisions that have been associated with longer hospitalization, higher costs, and possible complications (9).",

In addition, patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer are usually recommended to be treated with NACT. 17 r eight decades, radical mastectomy has been the only option for breast cancer surgery. 18 In 1969, the term quadrantectomy was approved by the World Health Organization. 19 ubsequently, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus adjuvant radiation therapy has been proven to be equivalent to mastectomy. 20 Since then, the standard surgical procedures for breast cancer management have included either BCS or mastectomy with axillary dissection. 21 e LABC management is complex 22 and requires all appropriate specialties in a multidisciplinary team (MDT), including radiologists; pathologists; surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists; gynecologists; oncology psychologists; social workers; nursing teams; nutritionists; and palliative care specialists. 23 Once a patient has been identified for NACT, a multimodal radiologic assessment before and during NACT is essential to assess tumor response. 23 Pretherapy radiologic marker clips can be placed in the breast and any biopsy-proven positive nodes to help the surgeon to locate the tumor during the surgery and have less extensive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). 24 like most cancer treatment programs worldwide that prioritize BCS in the early cancer stages, mastectomy is widely embraced over BCS in our region, regardless of the breast cancer stage at the time of diagnosis. 25",

Recent evidence that radioguided surgery can improve success rates, especially regarding detection of occult tumour lesions was described by Pouw et al. from Amsterdam [11]. Using a 3D-freehand SPECT device, successful detection of occult breast cancer lesions labelled with 125-Iodine seeds prior to the incision has been demonstrated. Whereas the vast majority of abstracts have focussed on lesion localization in breast cancer and melanoma, there were also contributions of radioguided surgery as integral part of more complex surgical interventions. Of note, Kleinjahn et al. presented an interesting imaging approach using a combined radiolabeled and fluorescent probe for guiding dissection of sentinel lymph nodes in prostate cancer [12] (Fig. 8).",

            "text": "Breast cancer recognition relies on various imaging modalities such as mammography [6,16] , ultrasound [9,10,17,18] , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [19] , and histopathology images [20] . Radiologists analyze these images to identify suspicious lesions and assess their malignancy. The interpretation of these images can be subjective and prone to human error. AI techniques, especially deep Shapley additive explanations (DeepSHAP), have demonstrated remarkable performance in breast cancer recognition tasks. Their lack of transparency and interpretability can limit their clinical utility. The explainable AI (XAI) methods have emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations, providing an understanding of the AI models' decision-making process and enabling more informed clinical decisions [21,22] . \n\nImaging modalities play a crucial role in breast cancer recognition, as they enable the early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of the disease. Various imaging techniques are used to visualize breast tissue, identify suspicious lesions, and assess their malignancy. The choice of the appropriate imaging modality depends on factors such as the patient's age, breast density, and risk factors for breast cancer. The main imaging modalities used in breast cancer recognition include mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). \n\nMammography [23] is the gold standard for breast cancer screening and is recommended for women of average risk starting at age 40 or 50, depending on the guidelines followed. It uses low-dose X-rays to produce images of breast tissue, which can reveal calcifications, masses, and architectural distortions that may indicate the presence of breast cancer. Mammography is highly effective in detecting breast cancer in its early stages, which significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. However, mammography has some limitations, including reduced sensitivity in dense breast tissue, false positives, and ionizing radiation exposure. \n\nBreast ultrasound [24,25] uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of breast tissue, making it a radiation-free modality. Ultrasound is often used as an adjunct to mammography, especially in women with dense breasts or those who cannot undergo. \n\nIt can differentiate between solid masses and fluidfilled cysts and guide biopsies of suspicious lesions.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women worldwide [1]. Furthermore, there are 685,000 related deaths yearly, making it the fifth leading cause of mortality worldwide [1]. The heterogeneous nature of the disease, with differing subtypes, increases the complexity of the disease; however, the combination of early detection programmes with improvements in the accuracy of staging and imaging techniques has increased the survival rates for breast cancer patients by enabling improved planning and treatment options compared to when surgery was the primary method of treatment [2]. At present, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed within the UK is 85% when diagnosed at an early stage; however, this decreases to 26.6% when diagnosed at stage IV [3]. Thus, it is important to stage the patients accurately to ensure the best possible patient outcomes. The literature suggests that approximately 2-10% of breast cancers will be metastatic in nature at the time of diagnosis, with clear signs and symptoms permitting accurate diagnosis and treatment [4]. It is suggested that only 5-7% newly diagnosed breast cancer have occult metastasis [5][6][7]. In early breast cancer (T1 to T2), the incidence of distant metastases is <2% in comparison to more advanced tumours (T3 and T4) where it is as high as 15-20% [8][9][10]. Hence, the general consensus in most of the national and international guidelines, such as the National Institute for Care Excellence, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2023), and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO2023), is not to use routine staging to diagnose occult distant metastasis in early breast cancer patients without Medicina 2024, 60, 321 2 of 14 any specific symptoms [10][11][12]. There is a lack of a generalised consensus on indications as well as the type of staging investigations used in breast cancer management. Most centres use computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, with a combination of other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scans.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the first in frequency among all types of cancer. Of all breast cancer cases, 99% occur in women (1% in men). The incidence of breast cancer cases and deaths has been increasing in the last 20 years. It is significant and relevant, from 1.15 and 0.410 million in 2002 to 2.26 and 0.685 million in 2020, respectively [195,210]. A variety of breast cancer treatments exist and are available at every development stage. Most patients require a combination of two or more treatments. After diagnosis, doctors determine the stage of cancer. They then decide on the best treatment options based on the stage and other factors, such as age, family history, genetic mutation status, and personal medical history. Breast cancer can be treated with surgery (mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, i.e., lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, partial mastectomy, or segmental mastectomy), radiation therapy (high-energy X-rays), chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide), hormone therapy (hormone-receptor-positive), and targeted therapy [211][212][213]. In this sense, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab-Herceptin), antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine, Kadcyla, or TDM-1), and kinase inhibitors (e.g., lapatinib and other inhibitors) are often used in targeted therapy [214]. The management of breast cancer in older women is highly individualized and requires collaboration across disciplines (medical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology) [212]. In the last 20 years, treatments have been employed as a key tool in controlling breast cancer, with a 65-80% sensitivity and specificity [213]. Therapies are not sufficiently developed as they have certain limitations. The most common is their non-specificity between normal and cancer cells, resulting in inevitable side effects and poor effects at the III and IV cancer stages [211]. Treatments for early-stage breast cancer may not be effective for advanced-stage breast cancer. If",

            "text": "Breast cancer is commonly detected in its early stage because of the extensive availability of mammography. 1 The standard treatment for early stage breast cancer is conservative surgery combined with radiotherapy (RT) administered to the whole breast. Adjuvant whole-breast RT provides increased local tumor control and considerably reduces the risk of death. 2 Early stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or advanced breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with positive lymph nodes 3 should be treated using adjuvant RT, which can increase the \n\nlocal tumor control rate and overall survival. 4 RT is a type of highly effective and targeted treatment used for destroying microscopic cancer cells that may have escaped surgical removal. 5 he most undesirable side effect of breast irradiation is skin toxicity in the irradiation field. Potential inhomogeneity of radiation doses is an inherent drawback associated with a standard tangential beam arrangement for breast RT. The currently used conventional tangential technique has negative effects on long-term cosmesis and has acute side effects. 6 Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is a more complex form of conformal RT than the conventional tangential technique. 7 IMRT is more advanced than conventional techniques, and the equipment consists of a variable aperture to shape dose distributions around targets; these distributions cannot be achieved using conventional equipment. Research showed that potentially more suitable dose distributions in the clinical target volume (CTV) of the breast, a lower incidence of acute skin toxicity, and lower doses to normal lung or heart tissues were associated with IMRT than with the standard technique; in addition, the cosmetic results after IMRT use were excellent. 8 Moreover, a prospective randomized trial comparing standard RT and IMRT reported that the breast appearance changed more visibly with standard RT than with IMRT in 233 patients with breast cancer. 9 mage-guided RT (IGRT) is a modality that uses imaging through computed tomography (CT) during RT to improve the accuracy and precision of radiation delivery. IGRT means that using TomoDirect, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), or IMRT planning techniques combined with CT image matching before RT delivery. It seems that IGRT has no difference in RT planning of skin dose or cardiac dose from IMRT.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that early stage diagnosis of clinically non-palpable malignant lesions can be achieved by utilizing many imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasonography and image-guided sampling for histopathology. 13 In conservative breast surgery, the biggest challenge for the surgeon remains obtaining clear surgical margins. Positive excision margins significantly increase local recurrence, 14 because re-excisional lumpectomy or mastectomy must then be performed. 15 or more conservative breast lesion localization, the use of WGL metallic markers, 2 ultrasound guided surgery, 16 and the radio-guided occult lesion localization technique 17 are now routinely used. Wire-guided biopsy is a well-known technique that has been used since the 1970s. In our study, WGL was successful in 100% of benign sample patients, with overall similar fewer complications related to surgical technique. \n\nIn our study, positive surgical margins were found in 11 (21.6%) of our 51 malignant lesions. Of the 11 patients with positive margins, seven (63.6%) underwent mastectomies, with the other four (36.4%) undergoing re-excisional lumpectomies. The total number of mastectomies performed as re-excisions in this study was 12, this number including the seven previously listed, and the five mastectomies that were performed after initial negative margins. \n\nThe total number of mastectomies needed to achieve satisfactory margins in patients after initial WGL was 10 (19.6%), as compared to the 20% reported in the literature. 18 There were two additional patients who underwent re-excisional lumpectomies after initial negative margins to obtain more satisfactory negative margins. \n\nThe BI-RADS is a standardized radiological reporting system that was established in 1993 by the American College of Radiology and has been modified multiple times to include other radiological modalities (e g., ultrasonography) that was initially oriented to mammography. 19 ][22] Our study found a very statistically significant association between BI-RADS and histology type.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. The recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Evidently, the investigated imaging modalities are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment, and, therefore, inadequate to guide resection in advanced laryngeal disease. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in laryngeal cancer at all stages. Abstract Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. Treatment consists of unimodal therapy through surgery or radiotherapy in early staged tumors, while advanced stage tumors are generally treated with multimodal chemoradiotherapy or (total) laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy. Still, the recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review, we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) and autofluorescence (AF) are established tools for early detection of laryngeal cancer. Nonetheless, their intraoperative utility is limited by an intrinsic inability to image beyond the (sub-)mucosa. Likewise, contact endoscopy (CE) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are technically cumbersome and only useful for mucosal margin assessment. Research on fluorescence imaging (FLI) for this application is sparse, dealing solely with nonspecific fluorescent agents. Evidently, the imaging modalities that have been investigated thus far are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and suggest how they can be",

B Ultrasound revealed a regressive course of the lesion (after treatment) averaging 3 \u00d7 0.9 cm with tissue marker (white arrows) in the center seen visualized on US [3]. However, lesions in patients who have a pathologically complete response (pCR) may shrink to the point of becoming invisible on the US. To select the best surgical option and achieve satisfactory outcomes, the placement of clearly visible markers in these breast lesions is necessary [4]. \n\nRadiopaque clips are the most widely used technique for marking tumor locations and lymph nodes to guide surgery in the post-neoadjuvant context [2]. It has been demonstrated that using radiodense marker clips to designate the region of interest is a reliable and efficient technique.",

            "text": "Breast cancer imaging is an essential part of breast cancer screening, diagnosis, preoperative/treatment assessment, and follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and are three fundamental modalities used in medical imaging, each with distinct advantages and constraints. New technologies have also allowed each modality to improve on its shortcomings. Imaging-guided biopsies provide accurate breast cancer diagnosis with low complication rates. \n\nImaging for breast cancer is divided into two primary categories: screening and diagnostic. The objective of screening mammography (or other imaging modality) in the healthy, asymptomatic female population is to detect undiagnosed cancer and treat it at an earlier stage before it manifests symptoms. Due to the fact that only a small percentage of breast cancers are detectable solely by clinical breast evaluation and the absence of a specific laboratory biomarker for breast cancer, imaging is the cornerstone of early detection [8]. Even though everyone agrees that the breast cancer screening program is helpful, no one can agree on the beginning age, ending age, or amount of time between screenings [9]. Different countries and organizations, such as the American Cancer Society, the American College of Radiology (ACR), and the European Commission, have come up with different guidelines, but most of them say that screening should start when a woman is between 40 and 50 years old and continue until she is 75 years old or until she has about 10 years left to live [9][10][11]. \n\nDiagnostic breast imaging, on the other hand, is for people who have symptoms or who have had an abnormal physical exam or abnormal first imaging (mostly from abnormal breast screening test memories). According to ACR's criteria for appropriateness, if a woman has a palpable finding, ultrasound is the first choice for patients younger than 30 years old, while mammography is the first choice for patients 40 years or older. In both cases, the next step depends on the results of the first investigation [12,13]. For women between the ages of 30 and 39, mammograms or ultrasound could be the first screening method of choice. \n\nThe cornerstone of breast imaging, both for screening and diagnostic reasons, is mammography.",

            "text": "The management of early stage breast cancers has shifted significantly in the past decade.Thus far, this has been driven by advances in the availability and application of molecular and genomic testing to guide systemic treatment decision making.However, local therapies namely surgery and radiation therapy, remain the backbone of breast conservation therapy.For most patients with early stage breast cancers undergoing breast conservation, adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) using a modestly hypofractionated treatment regimen remains the standard of care (1)(2)(3).\n\nHowever, in the last few years, there have been a number of new advances made in the local management of early stage breast cancer.These are driven by and rely on the advances in imaging, image guidance and treatment planning across the field of radiation oncology, leading to the development of novel concepts of management of early stage breast cancer including the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).This entails the use of hypofractionated regimens similar to the hypofractionated regimens of WBRT, or the use of shorter regimens delivered over one to ten fractions.Data from the last decade has demonstrated the safe implementation of PBI as compared to WBRT in the postoperative setting.Many phase III randomized studies have largely shown that PBI is associated with good cosmetic and toxicity outcomes, without compromising local failure rates when compared to WBRT (4-7).\n\nMore recently, multiple early stage, proof-of-concept trials are investigating the use of PBI in the pre-operative setting (8)(9)(10).This review introduces the history and development of PBI and reviews the clinical benefits and challenges associated with pre-operative APBI (PAPBI) therapy.We also discuss the advent of next generation technologies such as magnetic resonance (MR) guided radiation therapy (RT) and Cyberknife in PAPBI as well as challenges that still remain facing more widespread adoption of PAPBI.A summary of several ongoing or recently accrued PAPBI and postoperative PBI studies is provided in Table 1.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer deaths among them. Statistics indicate that the incidence of breast cancer is increasing year by year. 1 In 2018, approximately 2.1 million cases of female breast cancer were diagnosed worldwide, accounting for one-quarter of the total number of female cancer cases. 2 Traditional breast tumor treatment methods include classical radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, mastectomy, etc. [3][4][5] These methods damage the breast function of patients, result in aesthetic problems, and have typically slow recovery times. The recently developed interventional therapy is an emerging diagnosis and treatment method that integrates medical imaging technology and clinical treatment. With the help of medical imaging technologies, doctors use puncture needles, catheters, guide wires, and other medical equipment to perform interventional surgery on the lesion. Medical imaging technology is a tool to help doctors observe the operation process better. The main medical image guidance methods for diagnosing breast diseases are mammography, CT, ultrasound, and MRI. Mammography is the main method for breast cancer screening and detection, which successfully reduced breast cancer mortality. 6 CT has high application value in tumor diagnosis. \n\nUltrasound imaging has become an indispensable medical imaging method with its excellent economic benefits and real-time capabilities. Among the current clinical imaging methods, MRI has the highest sensitivity for detecting breast cancer and is the preferred breast tumor imaging method. 7 It has become an auxiliary diagnostic method for specific patient populations. 8 edical imaging is of great significance to the diagnosis and treatment of early breast cancer, and provides more possibilities for minimally invasive surgery. Breast interventional surgery is minimally invasive, and requires highly skilled and experienced doctors. Small wounds pose difficulties for surgeons and may result in residual diseased tissue and even damage normal tissue. Moreover, the operation process is often complicated and lengthy, which is not easy for diagnosis and targeted treatment. In addition, breast tissue has strong fluidity, and the internal tissue properties vary greatly. For different patients, the organizational structure is also very different. All of these make it more difficult to analyze, diagnose, and treat breast diseases.",

            "text": "Background Over the past decade, the adoption of screening programs, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has increased early-stage breast cancer diagnosis rates. Mortality rates have decreased due to early detection and improved treatments, including personalized therapies. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) is emerging as a convenient and effective treatment for some patients, with studies exploring its preoperative use. Preoperative APBI, especially with MRI guidance, offers improved tumor targeting and potentially reduced side effects. Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Single-Fraction Pre-Operative Radiotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer (RICE trial) aims to assess the feasibility and efficacy of MRI-guided single-dose radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage breast cancer. Methods The RICE study is a prospective, single-arm study evaluating single-fraction preoperative, APBI treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer using a magnetic resonance imaging linear accelerator (MRI linac). Eligible patients enrolled in this study will have a core biopsy to confirm estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative sub-type. RT planning will use a planning computed tomography (CT) co-registered with a MRI with the patient in either the supine or prone position. For the diagnostic workup, [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ([18F] FDG PET/CT) and [18F] fluoroestradiol positron emission tomography/CT ([18F] FES PET/CT) will be performed prior to treatment. Thirty patients will receive a single ablative RT dose of 21 Gray to the tumor. Pre-treatment and post-treatment MRI scans will be acquired at baseline and 5 weeks post-RT respectively. Breast-conserving surgery will be scheduled for 6 weeks after APBI treatment using the MRI linac. The primary study endpoint is the successful administration of a single fraction of preoperative breast RT under the guidance of an MRI linac. Secondary endpoints include evaluating the utility of MRI, [18F] FDG PET/CT, and [18F] FES PET/CT as a non-invasive method for assessing treatment response in patients undergoing single-fraction preoperative APBI. Conclusion The RICE trial represents",

            "text": "an accurate road map for the surgeon to help him or her obtain clear margins. It is well established that breast MRI is by far superior to mammography, with or without concomitant ultrasound, for the local staging of breast cancer. MRI allows the most accurate delineation of the size and the local extent of cancer, including the depiction of multifocal, multicentric or contralateral disease. MRI offers the highest sensitivity for demonstrating intraductal extensions around invasive cancers. For all these reasons, MRI should be considered an integral part of the workup of patients who undergo breast conserving treatment. And yet, the technique is only slowly adopted in clinical practice. Arguments against the use of breast MRI include costs, frequency of false positive diagnoses, lack of availability of minimally invasive biopsy capabilities, lack of evidence by randomized controlled clinical trials, and, last, fear of overtreatment. In this lecture, these concerns are explained, discussed and weighted against the advantages of MRI for breast cancer staging. The point is made that breast MRI is indeed essential for surgical planning, but that unnecessary mastectomy may result if old guidelines (established for mammographic staging) are used to guide management decisions regarding MR-detected lesions. Guidelines that require mastectomy for multicentric breast cancer were established before the advent of MRI. Using the same guidelines to manage MR-detected multicentric foci may be inappropriate because some of the small MRI-detected multicentric foci may be sufficiently treated by additional lumpectomy or even by radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) has become the standard treatment for patients with advanced breast cancers and is now a potential treatment for patients with earlier-stage operable disease. Pathological response of tumours to NC appears to correlate with the outcome. The advantage of NC is that it not only increases breast-conserving surgery, but also enables direct in vivo assessment of response. Breast imaging is used to evaluate the shrinkage of tumour under treatment and to try determine responders. Physical examination associated with mammography and ultrasound is a valuable noninvasive combination for assessing tumour response. At this time, this morphologic evaluation is the only one recognised by the international criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for the",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common female cancer worldwide. The lifetime risk for a woman in Europe to develop breast cancer is estimated to be one in eight. Being diagnosed with breast cancer carries a high psychological burden for any patient and thus improved cancer management strategies are sought which streamline the clinical workflow and could potentially improve the clinical outcome whilst avoiding the risk of over-diagnosis. \n\nWhen a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, surgery is often part of her individual therapy plan which can also include additional forms of treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Where possible lumpectomy combined with radiotherapy is the preferred treatment of choice. This involves removing only the cancerous tissue with a margin of healthy breast tissue, therefore conserving the unaffected parts of the breast. This has potential benefits over mastectomy, the complete removal of breast tissue, of being more acceptable to patients, offering good cosmetic results and comparably low risk of local recurrence. 26 arly detection of breast cancer, for example through national screening programmes, identifies a significant proportion of lesions that might not be palpable. This is often the case if their size is below a diameter of 10 mm. For the surgical removal of such a lesion, strategies have to be in place to localise the cancerous tissue accurately without tactile guidance. 16 ire guided procedures are commonly used in these cases but radioactive seed localisation strategies have also been suggested. 22 nce the cancerous tissue has been excised from the breast, the surgeon places marker clips into the cavity wall to provide information about the location of the tumour bed for subsequent radiotherapy. These clips are used to generate the radiation plan. The specimen is then sent for further histopathological examination to determine the presence, or otherwise, of cancerous tissue at the resection margin. Negative or positive margins are a strong predictor of local recurrence 2 which may in turn influence the long-term survival. 17 outine, diagnostic, pre-surgical, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR images contain valuable information about the size and location of cancer in the pendulous, prone orientated breast. However surgery and radiotherapy are performed with the patient in the supine position. In this paper we describe a novel methodology for prone to supine, image-to-image registration. This has a number of potential applications:",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with an estimated worldwide incidence of 2.2 million cases in 2020 [1]. Breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with early-stage breast cancer, and it is typically used to reduce the risk of local recurrence and increase overall survival [2,3]. Several studies on the long-term efficacy of external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) are currently being conducted and have demonstrated an outcome comparable to standard whole breast irradiation after breast conservation surgery [4][5][6][7][8][9]. To increase the dose homogeneity and conformity at the target and improve cosmesis, APBI with intensity-modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been used in some clinical trials [8][9][10].\n\nAPBI requires more positional accuracy than whole breast irradiation as it involves delivering a high dose in hypofractions to a relatively small area. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) ensures a highly accurate and precise patient positioning and consequently, efficient dose delivery. Several image-guided techniques have been applied to APBI treatment, including bone-based IGRT (e.g., chest wall and vertebral body), fiducial marker-based IGRT (e.g., gold markers or surgical clips) using megavoltage (MV) or kilovoltage (kV) imaging, 3D matching to the surgical cavity using cone-beam computed tomography (CT), and surface-guided radiation therapy (SGRT) [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Generally, these techniques exhibit higher positional accuracy than the traditional laser. Leonard et al. explored the feasibility of fiducial markers for IGRT in APBI and determined that marker-based IGRT improved the setup accuracy by 2 or 3 mm [17]. Gierga et al. evaluated the performance of several setup methods, such as 1 3 laser, bone anatomy, implanted clips, and SGRT,",

            "text": "Breast cancer has now surpassed lung cancer as the world's largest cancer, ranking first globally and fourth in China in the spectrum of cancer deaths in women (1,2). Advanced breast cancer (ABC), including locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), and metastatic breast cancer, which cannot undergo radical surgery at present, are related to the high incidence of metastasis and poor prognosis (3,4). Therefore, the main goal of its treatment is to delay the progress of the disease, prolong the survival time, and improve the quality of life of patients. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and salvage therapy for M1 stage breast cancer, instead of surgical resection at diagnosis, are recommended as the preferred treatment to ABC to provide more surgical opportunities and improve the survival rate according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (5). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of the curative effect is of particular significance. At present, the evaluation of clinical response is mainly carried out through pathological and clinical methods, that is, preoperative Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1) (6) and postoperative Miller-Payne (MP) Grading Criteria classification (7). In clinical application, the timing of surgery and intraoperative tumor resection volume are based on clinical response (8), which should be predicted as early as possible and focused on during treatment. \n\nStudies have proven that breast images can provide tumor biology behavior from multiple aspects but focus more on the changes during disease treatment. In the initial stage, the tumor baseline images can better reflect the original characteristics of the tumor. Ultrasonography is a low-cost imaging modality that increases cancer sensitivity and detection rates in dense breast populations. China has a relatively higher proportion of dense breast lesions than other countries (9), which explains the popularity and importance of ultrasound for Chinese breast screening. Moreover, with the continuous innovation of technology, multimodal ultrasound technology is more and more advocated because of its multiparameter and all-around evaluation ability. Shear wave elastography (SWE), a new technology in clinical applications in recent years, can provide quantitative information by measuring the stiffness of breast masses (10,11).",

Treatment concepts and consecutively the survival rate heavily depend on the initial cancer staging. Therefore, accurate imaging-based staging of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer is playing a pivotal role to determine the optimal treatment management and to minimize potential harmful surgical interventions and extensive systemic therapy [2]. \n\nKey points for the initial staging are the detection of tumor manifestations in the contralateral breast, evaluation of locoregional lymph nodes and the detection of distant metastases [3]. Depending on the primary tumor size and the locoregional lymph node status, surgery can extent from a breast-conserving therapy to a complete mastectomy and ipsilateral axillary dissection. In case of validated distant metastases the treatment concept switches to an extensive systemic and most likely palliative therapy [2]. \n\nAccording to the 2018 European Society For Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines a staging, including contrastenhanced thoraco-abdominal CT and bone scintigraphy [2,4], is considered in patients with advanced breast cancer (UICC III/IV) and patients with UICC stage II combined with additional risk factors like clinically positive axillary lymph nodes, large tumor size, aggressive biology (HER2neu over-expression, triple negative tumor) or clinical signs/laboratory values suggesting the presence of metastases. Staging in early breast cancer is directed at locoregional disease as patients do not benefit from a whole-body staging, since asymptomatic distant metastases are very rare in early tumor stages [2,[4][5][6]. \n\nRecent studies revealed a superiority of hybrid imaging modalities in detection of distant metastases and in correct malignant lesion rating for breast cancer patients [7][8][9].",

Surgical intervention is the preferred approach for early-stage disease, while neoadjuvant radiotherapy +/\u2212 sequential chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy followed by surgery is recommended for locoregionally advanced stages [10][11][12][13]. For oligometastatic patients, targeted treatments for metastases may include options such as surgical excision or stereotactic radiotherapy. Systemic treatment is offered for CS IV polimetastatic RC patients. Treatment decisions for metastatic disease are made on an individual basis within multidisciplinary teams [14][15][16]. Several diagnostic tools are currently available to determine the stage of RC, with some well-established in medical practice and others still evolving [9,17,18]. \n\nThe primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various imaging and metabolic diagnostic methods employed in the stage assessment of RC. By examining the existing literature, the study aims to evaluate the efficacy, accuracy, and limitations of these diagnostic tools in determining tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and the presence of distant metastases. The review encompasses a range of imaging modalities, which are discussed in detail. The review evaluates the strengths and limitations of each technique, their comparative effectiveness, and their role in guiding treatment decisions. By synthesizing the findings from multiple studies, this review aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of imaging and metabolic diagnostic methods in the stage assessment of RC. The information presented in this review will help improve clinical decision-making, improve treatment planning, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes.",

            "text": "Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. It is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women, followed by colorectal and lung cancer [1]. In 2020, breast cancer surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed malignancy, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases [1]. Over the past few decades, the management of breast cancer has progressed from radical treatment to targeted surgery with the use of more individualized therapeutic regimes [2]. In the era of precision medicine, early cancer diagnosis can allow for prompt medical intervention and effective treatment [3]. This will prevent the progression of disease from early to advanced stages. Consequently, this can help improve cancer prognosis and ultimately reduce overall mortality rates. \n\nVarious imaging modalities are utilized in investigating breast cancer, including ultrasound sonography (USS), mammography (MMG), MRI, and CT. With the increasing incidence of breast cancer diagnosed, imaging is at the forefront of guiding clinicians in the best approaches to managing breast malignancies. \n\nIn recent years, the rise of personalized medicine and the advancement of medical imaging analysis has encouraged the development of radiomics in the field of medicine. This exponential growth has enabled researchers to develop the field of radiomics through high-output computing. Radiomics is an emerging field of study in medical imaging that contains a broad set of computational methods. It uses data algorithms to extract quantitative features from radiographic images [4,5]. These extracted features, commonly known as radiomic features, can be utilized to guide diagnosis, treatment response, and prognosis in clinical settings. Radiomic analysis is built on the central hypothesis that tumor imaging reflects the underlying biological characteristics of the tumor, which may be presented as different radiomic values [5]. Previous studies have compared the performance of radiomics in several aspects of the diagnostic and staging process of many cancer pathologies, including breast cancer. This included differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions, predicting lymph node metastases from primary breast malignancies, identifying spinal metastases from lung primaries, predicting survival of patients with high-grade gliomas, and determining the invasiveness risk of stage 1 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The exponential growth of radiomic research has led to its widespread integration into clinical practice.",

The age distribution showed a higher incidence among women aged 40 to 59, consistent with findings from studies in Canada [21], Singapore [22], \n\nand Malaysia [23]. This trend highlights the importance of targeted screening programs for middle-aged women, aligning with the US Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation to begin screening in their forties [24]. \n\nBreast cancer incidence was highest in the Brunei-Muara district and among Malay women, reflecting Brunei's population distribution, where 76.8% are Malay, 9.6% are Chinese and 13.6% are of other ethnicities [7]. Ductal carcinoma was the most common histological type (75.2%), consistent with global data where ductal carcinoma represents about 80% of all breast cancer cases [25], and comparable prevalence was observed regionally: 72.1% in Singapore [26], 77.1% in Penang [27], and 89.3% in Kuala Lumpur [28]. Surgical intervention was the most common treatment in our study, followed by chemotherapy. A majority of patients (62.9%) received treatment within 60 days of diagnosis. \n\nOur study found significant differences in the distribution of cancer stages among the different first-line treatment types, indicating that the modality of first-line treatment is significantly associated with the stage of cancer at diagnosis. According to our data, patients with localised stage cancer were more likely to undergo surgery, while those with regional stage cancer were more likely to receive chemotherapy. Most localised stages are treated with surgery, followed by radiotherapy or endocrine therapy for five years to eliminate any remaining cancer cells [29]. Regional stages are often treated using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or immunotherapy before surgery, and advanced stages with distant metastasis focus on relieving symptoms, which may involve palliative care [30].",

            "text": "Breast cancer management is a multifaceted endeavor, relying on five primary treatment modalities: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy [191]. The customization of each patient's treatment plan hinges primarily on the disease stage and the molecular profile [192]. In this era of personalized medicine, intricate patient-specific details play a pivotal role. These encompass decisions regarding which treatment line is most suitable, the timing of interventions, and the sequence of these therapeutic approaches. The administration of these treatment modalities within specialized, high-volume breast cancer centers, guided by multidisciplinary team assessments, is no longer an extravagance but a determinant of patients' oncological outcomes and their overall quality of life [192]. Surgery encompasses both breast and axillary procedures. Within breast surgery, there are two primary categories: breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy, the latter of which may or may not involve reconstruction. Breast-conserving surgery represents the gold standard for early-stage breast cancer [193]. Mastectomy, on the other hand, remains a vital alternative for those ineligible for breast conservation, such as the patients with locally advanced tumors at the time of surgery, patients unsuitable for breast irradiation, individuals with multicentric tumors that cannot be sufficiently removed through oncological resection, and those who opt against breast conservation [192][193][194][195][196]. For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction surgeries, whether involving synthetic or autologous implants, offer crucial options [197][198][199]. Axillary surgery encompasses procedures such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). SNB has become the standard approach for node-negative breast cancer and selected cases of node-positive breast cancer. However, axillary dissection remains necessary for patients with multiple metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of surgery, as well as for individuals who are not suitable candidates or have experienced failed sentinel lymph node localization [160,[200][201][202][203].",

            "text": "Diagnostic procedures are crucial for the early detection of breast cancer. Advancements in imaging technology now enable us to detect mammographically and ultrasonographically occult lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) findings. MRI is well known for effectively detecting ductal spreading before breast-conserving surgery with excellent contrast resolution. The advantage of CT is a shorter single acquisition with extent evaluation. In Japan, CT is used for detecting the intraductal component of breast cancer as an alternative to MRI [1][2][3][4].\n\nMultidetector-row CT (MDCT) produces imaging with a wide range and short volume acquisition time, recompounding thin slice imaging, and high-resolution and reconstructed imaging [1,2,5].\n\nEnhancement on MDCT or MRI is due to angiogenesis and increased capillary permeability [6,7]. Enhancement of a lesion is an indication of proliferation regardless of whether it is malignant or benign. These lesions are not palpable, therefore imaging-guided biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. There are three available ways to perform a biopsy under imaging guidance: stereo-guided, sonographically guided and MRI-guided procedures.\n\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)'s guidelines have recommended the performance of MRIguided needle sampling and/or wire localization of MRI-detected findings since 2007 [8]. Consequently, the MRIguided biopsy is widely available in imaging centers in the United States. Although the MRI-guided biopsy is often used for MRI-detected lesions [9,10], MRI has limitations such as its low specificity, the fact that it is a time-consuming procedure, and the variation in its technical accuracy among institutions [9][10][11][12]. The availability of MRI-guided biopsy is limited in Asia, including in Japan [9][10][11][12]. On the other hand, CT-guided biopsy for MDCT detected lesions is not practical due to radiation exposure concerns [13][14][15][16][17][18].\n\nThe rationale for further modalities needed to evaluate MDCT-or MRI-detected lesions is latent formation of malignant",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the incidence keeps increasing [1]. The standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients is breastconserving surgery (BCS), in which the surgeon aims to remove the tumor while maintaining the natural shape of the breast as much as possible [2]. It has been shown that lack of direct view over the surgical site or surgeon's failure to determine the exact position of the tumor based on preoperative images may lead to incomplete resection of the tumor and incidence of positive margin [3]. Positive margins occur when the excised tumor is not surrounded by at least 2 mm of healthy tissue. The incidence of positive margin during tumor surgery is a widespread problem in clinical practice, but no standard solution has been developed yet [4]. In the case of positive margin detection, re-excision surgery or extra radiation therapy and chemotherapy are required [5][6][7]. Based on the literature, the occurrence rate for re-excision surgery ranges from less than 10% to around 50% [8]. \n\nWhile positive margin incidence can cause difficulties for patients and hospitals, pre-operative localization of breast lesions, such as needle localization, intraoperative ultrasound, radio-guided surgery, and also intraoperative assessments techniques, such as gross assessment, specimen radiograph, frozen section, and cavity shave margins, seem to be promising techniques to overcome these undesired outcomes [8]. However, all of these techniques have their limitations. For instance, needle localization could be accompanied by affecting incision location, poor cosmetic results, and could be more time consuming while causing more discomfort to the patient [8,9]. Intraoperative ultrasound is an operator-dependent technique requiring extra markers for lesions such as DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) [8][9][10]. In addition to the limitation in detecting small, noncalcified lesions during radio-guided surgery and seed localization, the need to onside nuclear support is associated with consuming more time, costs, and specialist workforce, which is not possible for many facilities [8,11].",

            "text": "Surgeons need to be able to correlate 2D radiological images with the real location of the tumor within the patients breast for surgical planning, both pre and per-operatively. Despite all preoperative and intra-operative localization techniques, accuracy is still not perfect, and the process requires additional exams and invasive procedures in the pre-operative setting or expertise in US techniques in case of an intra-operative setting. \n\nThe diagnostic breast cancer workflow includes different imaging modalities acquired in different positions and with different breast compressions and consequent deformations. As breast cancers are diagnosed more frequently at an early stage and most of them are non-palpable, localization techniques are frequently needed: wire-guided, carbon tattooing, radioactive seed localization, radio-occult lesion localization and magnetic seeds are considered as standard. However, among these techniques, none has proven superiority in terms of reducing positive margins [2]. Worldwide, re-excision rates following breast cancer conservative surgery exhibit wide variability. Re-operation rates range from 0% to 70% (by individual surgeons) in the United States [10], from 17% to 56% in Canada [11], and from 12 to 30% [12] in England. \n\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to improve breast cancer surgical outcomes. Preoperative contrast-enhanced breast MRI has emerged as a solution, but neither the COMICE [13] nor the MONET [14] trial found an associated benefit. Additional studies are needed to further exploit additional MRI information and techniques to be applied in the surgical theater [15]. Intraoperative US (as an additional tool to standard localization techniques) has been used successfully to some extent to reduce positive margins, therefore reducing re-operation rates [16,17]. However, the use of intraoperative US requires a level of expertise beyond the standard for breast surgeons and could also be time-consuming within the surgical theater. These considerations strongly suggest the need for development of a novel methodology to enhance the surgeon's visualization for tumor localization and consequently to improve surgical clinical outcomes. \n\nThis work describes a successful experimental test with a digital non-invasive method for intra-operative breast cancer localization. A patient-specific 3D digital breast model was processed and viewed through AR to guide a breast cancer conservative surgery.",

            "text": "Most breast cancers are detected due to clinical symptoms or by screening mammography. The standard way to assess suspicious lesions is with the so-called triple assessment: mammography, ultrasound, and image-guided needle biopsy. MRI is not yet involved in initial cancer detection except in those women, usually at high risk, screened with MRI. When a breast cancer is detected, MRI may be performed to assess disease extent, look for satellite lesions, and screen for other cancers either in the affected or in the contralateral breast. MRI is much better in tumour extent evaluation than either mammography or ultrasound, even though tumour size overestimation and underestimation still occur in up to 15 % of patients. Although a better documentation of tumour size and extent could lead to a better tailored surgery, with a low rate of re-interventions for positive resection margins, randomized studies that evaluated the surgical outcome of preoperative MRI gave conflicting results [45][46][47][48]. In patients with invasive lobular carcinoma, a specific diffuse growing tumour type notoriously underestimated by mammography and ultrasound, a reduction of re-excisions from 18 % to 11 % was observed [49], although this was not statistically significant in a meta-analysis [50]. Other suggested indications are discrepancy in tumour size among different modalities (including clinical examination) that may change the treatment strategy, breast cancer found in a high-risk woman, and eligibility for partial breast irradiation [7,51]. \n\nPreoperative MRI also detects many additional enhancing lesions unseen with mammography and ultrasound. Approximately 50 % of them are cancerous (increased up to 75 % in the breast harbouring an already known malignancy), indicating that pathological verification is necessary, especially when the additional lesions are distant from the already diagnosed cancer. When additional disease is detected, this logically leads to more extensive surgery. However, this must be regarded with caution. It should be understood that breast conserving surgery in breast cancer in over 40 % of patients is primarily aimed at reducing disease extent rather than being completely curative [52].",

            "text": "Real-time image fusion has been widely applied to liver diseases (3). Several investigations reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT/MRI was superior to conventional ultrasound in detection of hepatic nodules, especially for small hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis (4)(5)(6). By extension, CT/MRI navigated ultrasound was useful to guide radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas that are poorly defined on conventional ultrasound (7)(8)(9). \n\nRecently, the utility of real-time image fusion also has been investigated in the field of breast. Yamamoto et al. (10) reported that fusion imaging of real-time ultrasound and CT-lymphography improved the preoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes, and its accuracy for predicting metastasis was 81%. Breast MRI and ultrasound are the most popular imaging modalities for the assessment of preoperative stages of breast cancer. Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (15)(16)(17)(18). Consequently, real-time MRI navigated ultrasound and biopsy could replace the MRI-guided biopsy for MRI-detected lesions. \n\nThe purpose of the current pictorial essay is to illustrate the technical principles of real-time MRI navigated ultrasound, and to demonstrate the clinical implementation of the system in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the United States, and it is identified at increased rates due to earlier detection methods [1]. Contemporary treatment modalities are numerous and include surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy, and are often used in a multidisciplinary approach. As a recent example, PARP inhibitors such as olaparib and talazoparib, have been approved for the subset of BRCA carriers with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer [2]. Approximately 5-10% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, and unfortunately have grimmer prognoses compared to those diagnosed with earlier stages of breast cancer [3]. The survival rate of metastatic breast cancer patients is 20% over a 5-year period, and these patients also have less treatment options compared to patients with early disease [4]. Surgical removal of the primary tumor in metastatic breast cancer patients often does not improve patient outcomes and so is not routinely part of the treatment regimen unless it is performed for palliation of symptoms. In contrast, systemic therapies have traditionally been used for metastatic disease [5]. \n\nCurrently, studies are being performed to investigate percutaneous treatment options that directly target the primary tumor mass. Radiofrequency, cryo-, laser-, and microwave ablation techniques represent minimally invasive procedures to treat primary breast tumors for patients who are not traditional surgical candidates (lumpectomy or mastectomy). For patients with symptomatic tumors, ablative techniques may offer palliative benefits, such as reduction in patient discomfort. In a systematic review of 45 studies, it was found that 96% of imaging-guided ablation techniques on patients were technically successful, with radiofrequency and cryoablation completely ablating the lesion at the highest rate [6]. Cryoablation historically has been used for patients with benign masses (e.g., fibroadenomas) as well as invasive tumors of small size and in early stages. The ICE3 trial investigated the effectiveness and safety of cryoablation for low-risk, hormone positive, earlystage breast cancers as an alternative treatment modality to an operative approach [7].",

            "text": "Since the NSABP B-06 trial, the BCT has been proven to have the same survival rate as mastectomy. Furthermore,   the number of early-stage breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy decreased. In recent studies, however, it has been reported that breast cancer patients are having more mastectomy surgeries. 10 In part, the increased use of mastectomy can be attributed to the perception that patients with unfavorable factors, such as younger age, HER2-amplified breast cancer, and advanced reconstructive surgery, have a poorer prognosis. 11 A real-world analysis of our study showed that patients treated with BCT had better overall survival rates than those treated with a mastectomy. In addition, these results were confirmed after accounting for variables in the matched cohort. It is consistent with the results of de Boniface J et al. 12 that the BCT yielded a better survival than mastectomy after adjusting for comorbidities and socioeconomic background.\n\nThis was a population-based study to examine whether BCT might be more beneficial than mastectomy for different subtypes of breast cancer. We agree with previous studies that advocate BCT. Agarwal S et al. 5 found that BCT reduced the mortality risk in patients with tumors less than 4 cm and matching nodes. And Hwang et al. 13 demonstrated that BCT was associated with a lower risk of death. A recent study including early-stage breast cancers also reported that the patients with BCT experienced better OS than those with the mastectomy. 14 Several small population-based studies conferred the same results. 15,16 However, in many populations, the studies failed to match important factors like tumor subtypes and age. Using the PSM method to compare two closely matched populations allows us to simulate randomization on the survival results of BCT and mastectomy. Regardless of tumor subtypes, tumor stage, and lymph node stage subgroups, BCT had a better overall survival and cancerspecific survival rate than mastectomy in our study.\n\nIt is unclear why our study and those mentioned above indicate different survival outcomes, whereas several clinical trials have demonstrated equivalent survival between patients who undergo BCT and mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients. There are several plausible explanations. One is",

            "title": "Association of shared decision-making with type of breast cancer surgery: a cross-sectional study",
            "text": "Our study focused on a relatively young and predominantly pre-menopausal group of women with early-stage breast cancer who had a relatively high overall rate of mastectomy. Few studies have explored breast surgery in this type of population, and there are wide variations in mastectomy rates both within and between different countries.\n\nOur results suggest that patients might prefer mastectomy whereas surgeons might prefer breast conservation. Recent reports have indicated that when fully informed about the risks and benefits of various surgery options, a significant proportion of patients will actively choose mastectomy [22]. We studied women with stage 0-II breast cancer to examine the associations between SDM and treatment decisions according to disease stage and to determine whether the patient or physician plays the primary role in determining surgical options. Treatment decisions made by women with early-stage breast cancer may be more affected by the surgeon's providing of information, whereas decisions made by women with advanced stage breast cancer may be more dependent on their own opinions. Although most patients want to share in the decision making process [1,2], our findings suggest that treatment decisions are dependent on disease stage. For example, patients with stage IIb breast cancer may play a more collaborative role in treatment decisions than those with early-stage breast cancer, and a collaborative role may be more associated with mastectomy than BCS. Previous studies [11,23] have reported that women who reported being most active in decision making were less likely than more passive women to undergo BCS, suggesting that women with more autonomy are more likely to choose a procedure perceived as more definite [11,23]. This autonomy may be associated with maximizing patient outcomes [11]. Because patients believed that mastectomy was clinically superior, those who played a greater role in decision making were more likely to undergo mastectomy [24]. Patients may prefer mastectomy over BCS because of concerns about recurrence of disease, recovery from surgery, and side effects of radiation treatment [25]. Women with stage IIb breast cancer may consider their doctors' opinions as important factors in decision making. However, women uncertain about treatment decisions can ask questions regarding the consequences of surgery and the possibility of recurrence. In addition, some surgeons may continue to believe that mastectomy is clinically superior to BCS, particularly because of the lower risk of local",

            "text": "The different stages of detecting breast cancer are screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. Screening is performing exams on individuals who do not show symptoms of breast cancer in order to determine whether there is cancer. Screening helps to detect the cancer early before symptoms manifest and prior to spreading to other tissues. Common modalities used in breast cancer screening are SBEs, CBE, and mammograms.\n\nHaving screened for breast cancer, further diagnostic tests are performed to confirm the disease and also to determine if the tumor(s) observed is benign or malignant. Being diagnosed with breast cancer, the patient then requires other tests to determine the prognosis and decide on treatment options. Some of these tests include estrogen and progesterone receptor test, human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor test, and multigene tests. Some of the imaging techniques used in the diagnostic stage are ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 6 These tests give specific information to help identify the stage of the tumor and whether it is growing rapidly or slowly. Staging is then performed in order to classify the cancer into a stage ranging from zero to four, with four being the most advanced. Some imaging modalities used throughout this stage are chest X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and bone scans. 4 After being diagnosed, the patient may undergo neoadjuvant therapy or primary therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is a means to decrease tumor size if the tumor is too large to successfully remove. Primary therapy follows neoadjuvant therapy or may be the first step taken after diagnosis. It typically consists of surgery, more specifically mastectomies or lumpectomies, to remove the tumor. Following primary therapy, there is an adjuvant therapy which aims to prevent the recurrence of the cancer and promote longevity of the patient. 7 Post-adjuvant therapy patients require periodic monitoring to ascertain that they are tumor free. The prognostic stage is monitoring using imaging modalities that include mammograms, breast MRI, ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), and/or CT scans. 8",

            "text": "Breast cancer diagnosis has undergone a dramatic evolution in the last few decades. Due to the emergent availability in mammography screening programs, there has been a rapid increase in the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast cancer (NBC) to the breast surgeon [1]. Diagnosis is therefore more often made at an early stage, which is associated with decreased incidence of lymph node involvement. A suitable treatment for early stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery (BCS) [2,3]. \n\nFor breast-conserving treatment of NBC, an accurate intraoperative guidance is essential to achieve complete tumor removal with acceptable cosmetic results [4]. Traditionally, the surgical excision of this kind of lesion has been carried out with some methods; however, each technique suffers from various limitations [5][6][7]. Recently, a novel method of using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence has been described in breast surgery [8,9]. \n\nIn this article, we designed our study to evaluate the usefulness of ICG fluorescence-guided nonpalpable breast cancer lesion excision (IFNLE) and its results, to see whether the technique can be accepted as an alternative method of image guidance for the procedure.",

Patients were clinically eligible for both BCT and MT and were offered to choose between both treatment options. Most patients (63%) preferred to be treated with BCT, whereas one-quarter (24%) preferred MT, and some (12%) felt unsure about their preferred treatment. Subsequently, 90% of the patients chose the type of surgery they initially preferred; 72% chose BCT and 28% MT. This is comparable to the rate of BCT reported by Whelan et al (1999). In their study, 73% of patients with a choice opted for BCT after the introduction of a decision aid. Thus, not all women eligible for a choice between BCT and MT want BCT. \n\nInvestigating the relative importance of different predictors of treatment preference and the treatment decision resulted in a model with good predictive qualities (Figure 2). What patients thought to be the treatment preference of their physician was found to be the most important predictor of their own treatment preference. Likewise, previous studies also found that physicians are a major factor in the treatment decisions made for breast cancer (Ward et al, 1989;Kotwall et al, 1996;Stafford et al, 1998;",

The questions asked of radiology are changing and its answers will need to be \"systems\" oriented. Imaging-guided biopsy has replaced surgical biopsy of suspicious breast lesions to reduce unnecessary surgery for benign disease and indicate the need for sentinel lymph node procedure. Biopsy guidance depends on lesion visibility at sonography, mammography or MRI. For minimizing the false negative results, 9-14G needles and vacuum-assisted systems are the preferred sampling methods for G H most lesions. Image documentation of non-palpable lesion location and residual amount after biopsy is mandatory for preoperative lesion localization planning. A clip is positioned at the site of biopsy whenever a suspicious lesion disappears during sampling or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Preoperative lesion localization is usually guided by the imaging modality that has been used for biopsy. Specimen radiograph during surgery reduces surgical cancer removal with positive tumor margins at postoperative pathology. Breast cancer staging encompasses a wide variety of anatomical and pathologic features that have a clear impact on treatment: size, extensive intraductal component, extension to the nipple-areola complex, the pectoralis muscle or the skin and lymph node status. Compared with mammography and ultrasound, MRI is the most accurate imaging modality for local staging, except for lymph node assessment, where ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy are the techniques of choice. The different follow-up strategies in the breast cancer patient depend on the clinical scenario: assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, follow-up of patients treated with conservative or reconstructive surgery, confirmation of a suspected recurrence and evaluation of residual disease after positive margins at pathology. The role of different imaging modalities will be demonstrated in teaching cases. The objective of stress imaging are to assess perfusion, synchronicity, viability or functional reserve. Adenosine stress enables assessment of cardiac perfusion reserve which is an early indicator of significant coronary artery disease.

Women who require surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer may prefer to undergo breast-conserving therapy, as oncologic breast surgery can have a profound impact on a woman's body image and sense of self. Detection of synchronous breast cancers on initial diagnosis is critical for determining eligibility for breast conserving surgery [2].\n\nMammography is the only proven efficacious radiographic screening technique for detection of breast cancer; however, the sensitivity of mammography has been reported to be lower in women with dense breasts than in women with primarily fatty breasts (62.2% vs. 88.2%) [3,4]. Furthermore, detection of synchronous malignancy is more challenging because the additionally detected breast cancer lesions are known to be smaller and less suspicious than the index cancer [5]. Bilateral wholebreast ultrasonography (BWBU) has been used to overcome these limitations of mammography and has been reported to be an efficacious imaging modality in identifying mammographically occult breast cancer in preoperative staging [6]. Hence, the roles of various other imaging modalities are under study for detection of breast cancer lesions not detected on mammography or clinical breast examination [7]. To our knowledge, there has been no published study regarding the positive predictive value (PPV) of BWBU in detection of synchronous breast lesions in a large population.\n\nThe purpose of our study was to evaluate the PPV of BWBU on detection of synchronous breast lesions on initial diagnosis of breast cancer and also evaluate factors affecting the PPV of BWBU according to various clinical and imaging factors.",

            "text": "In the United States, breast cancer ranks second as a cause of cancer-related death in women 1 . Breastconserving surgery (BCS), or lumpectomy, is a standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer and is favored for preservation of the breast, reduced morbidity, and rapid recovery [2][3][4] . Although BCS is the preferred surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer, it can be challenging to accurately identify the tumor site when the tumor is small and nonpalpable 5 . This difficulty can lead to inadequate clearance of the margins associated with increased risk of local recurrence, and it requires a second operation for adequate margins. The current re-operation rate is approximately 25% on average, but some series report rates as high as 37% [6][7][8][9][10] . Thus, surgical guidance tools that can accurately locate the tumor and optimize the resection of adequate margins in real time are needed. \n\nMammogram and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose and localize the breast tumor mass, but these technologies are bulky in size and not accessible in the operating room. The current gold standard of clinical practice to help locate the tumor during the surgery is guide wire localization (GWL) prior to surgery, in which a thin wire is inserted into the tumor mass under image guidance with its terminal tip within the tumor or tumor bed 11 . However, the location of the guide wire tip inside the breast tissue is not visible to the surgeon and only provides a rough estimation of the tumor location. Even with the GWL method, the re-operation rate remains high 12,13 . A newer method is seed implantation to improve the localization of the tumor during the operation. By utilizing a handheld probe to detect a beacon that is pre-implanted in the tumor mass, such as a radioactive/ radiofrequency seed 14,15 or a radiofrequency identification tag (RFID) 16 , the tumor location can be more accurately identified. The radioactive/radiofrequency seed methods can generally provide only the distance of the probe to the beacon in terms of pseudo numbers without units, which is a qualitative measure and is not accurate enough.",

            "text": "If this is the case, additional approaches (e. g., image-guided surgery with ICG-p28 in combination with other therapeutic approaches) need to be further considered to manage these microlesions. The other possibility is that the precursor-like lesion (e.g., atypical hyperplasia) which was captured in the histological section of the MFP specimen (Supplemental Figure S7) was left behind in the surgical bed. As PDX tumours can contain several precursor lesions such as atypical hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, pagetoid lobular carcinoma in situ, 60 it is possible that they can be a source of invasive/noninvasive breast cancer due to the characteristics of the PDX models. 61,62 Since we are aware that the complete surgical excision of the early stage of disease with negative margins is important from the clinical point of view, intraoperative imaging on the early stage of disease is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, given that only one mouse in the ICG-p28 group demonstrated tumour recurrence and that the volume of the recurred tumour was the smallest among the other groups, ICG-p28-guided surgery appears to assist well in precisely identifying tumour margins and to significantly reduce tumour recurrence rates. Overall, imageguided surgery with ICG-p28 in multiple subtypes of breast cancer (Figures 4,6) resulted in an average recurrent tumour volume of 300 mm 3 , whereas surgery with ICG alone or without interoperative imaging (PBS) resulted in average recurrent tumour volumes of 1188 mm 3 (P = 0.017, Friedman's test) and 1289 mm 3 (P = 0.032, Friedman's test), respectively. In addition, the tumour recurrence rate for the ICG-p28 groups was 8% (92% specificity, N = 2/24), while the tumour recurrence rates for the ICG and PBS groups were 33% (N = 8/24) and 29% (N = 7/24), respectively, (Figure 6e).",

We look forward to welcome you all to get an updated information that could directly be utilised in your clinical services. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Imaging plays a key role in the early detection of breast cancer. Mammography is an accepted screening modality. It has been shown that additional imaging modalities like ultrasound and MR imaging of the breast can significantly improve cancer detection and characterisation. An international classification system (BIRADS\u00ae) has been introduced and offers a global language for breast imager. In case of BIRADS\u00ae 4 and 5 lesions imaging guided biopsies are recommended before definitive surgery. The interpretation of imaging findings and pathologic results (b-classification) is essential and should be performed in multidisciplinary team conferences. It has been shown that such conferences have a strong impact on overall survival because mismanagement and failures can be reduced significantly. During this session the assembly will learn basics as well as about the importance of guidelines and risk management (failure conferences), illustrated by case studies. Clinical management of patients with HCC is a decision-making process that should be approached following evidence-based data. Staging is a relevant topic in these patients because it determines the therapeutic approach. Tumoural extension based on MRI or CT findings and prognosis assessment are critical steps in the management of patients with HCC to indicate treatment, to predict response to treatment and to predict survival. For optimal results any proposal has to take into account liver function, tumour stage and physical status. Up to now, the only proposal linking staging to prognostic prediction and treatment indication is the BCLC approach. Updated BCLC staging in 2012,",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the world [1]. As the improvements in imaging techniques, the increased awareness of patients and widespread screening mammography, the number of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer has increased during the past decades [2]. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) plus adjuvant radiotherapy has become the alternative treatment to mastectomy for early stage breast cancer because of equivalent survival [3,4]. It is well known that obtaining negative surgical margins during BCS procedures is considered to be critically important in decreasing recurrence rates [5,6]. \n\nThe current focus is on improving the surgical accuracy of BCS, especially a higher rate of margin negative with smaller excision volume [7,8]. Various techniques have been used to localize breast lesions during BCS. Guide wire localization (GWL) is a standard technique for localization of non-palpable breast lesions [9]. However, there are several disadvantages of GWL, including a miss rate up to 20% of cases, and the possibility of wire transaction, dislocation or migration. Besides, the insertion of the wire could be uncomfortable for patients [10,11]. For palpable breast cancer, tumor excision is usually guided by preoperative diagnostic images and experience and tactile skills of the surgeons. However, palpation alone may be insufficient in differentiating between malignant tissues and surrounding tissues, especially in dense breasts. Palpation-guided surgery could lead high incidence of positive margins, ranging from 20% to 60% [12,13]. \n\nTherefore, a procedure with a higher rate of negative margins and less discomfort for the patient would be preferable. Examining the breasts by Ultrasound (US) was first described by Wild and Neal [14]. Its application has expanded from preoperative assessment and diagnostic guidance to intraoperative localization of breast cancers. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance (IOUS) was developed in 1988 [15]. It is an ultrasound probe that is used to localize the breast tumor in the operating theatre. IOUS may improve surgical accuracy of breast cancer excision. Since its introduction, several studies were published on IOUS focusing on margin status for either non-palpable or non-palpable breast cancers.",

In BRCA1/2 carriers, 20% of cancers are DCIS and 80% are invasive [9,97].\n\nSeventy percent of invasive breast cancers are ER-positive [98,99], among which 49% are premenopausal; 15% of early/locally advanced breast cancers and 25% of advanced breast cancers are HER2-positive; 27% BRCA1 and 67% BRCA2 breast cancers are ER-positive; 5% BRCA1 and 14% BRCA2 breast cancers are HER2-positive [100][101][102][103][104][105]. All costs are adjusted for BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancers for differences in stage at presentation, the proportion of being non-invasive, and the proportion of being ER-positive or HER2-positive.\n\nAnnual breast cancer treatment costs in the USA are obtained from Grann et al. 2011 [89] and inflated using the medical component of the USA consumer price index to 2016 US$. In the UK, Netherlands, China, Brazil, and India, breast cancer treatment costs are estimated based on clinical guidelines and unit costs are detailed as below.\n\nDiagnosis costs: Whether suspected at breast screening or through presentation to the GP, diagnosis in the breast clinic is made by triple assessment (clinical assessment, mammography, and ultrasound imaging with core biopsy and/or fine needle aspiration cytology) [98]. Clinical examination and mammography costs are from the paper by Robertson C et al. [106]. Breast ultrasound and biopsy costs are obtained from NHS reference costs [88] in the UK and from primary data in Netherlands, China, Brazil, and India. For all patients presented with suspected advanced breast cancer, MRI should be offered to assess for bone metastases [99].\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) costs: SLNB is used for staging axilla for early invasive breast cancer and no evidence of lymph node involvement on ultrasound or a negative ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (",

            "text": "Positive preoperative indication for systemic therapy based on biopsied tissue and conventional breast imaging showed high agreement with a positive postoperative indication from resected tissue (the gold standard). A negative preoperative indication was only accurate in tumors not larger than 2.0 cm on DCE-MRI or with a PME>PDE score at 31 P-MRS. Thus, in a subgroup of patients with early-stage breast cancer, preoperative multiparametric breast MRI at 7T enables an accurate risk assessment of breast cancer comparable to conventional assessment from surgically resected tissue. \n\nThese findings may ultimately have practice-changing impact on the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer, who are currently susceptible to overtreatment [29]. Continuous effort is made towards more individualized and less invasive therapy in this group of patients, but current guidelines for systemic therapy still require a representative resection specimen. Early-stage breast cancer patients in whom the positive indication for systemic therapy is known with high accuracy prior to surgery could be treated with systemic therapy prior to the surgical intervention, thus achieving similar long-term benefit as postoperative systemic therapy, but with the added benefit of allowing response of the tumor and axilla to be monitored [30]. This opens new treatment paradigms where patients with excellent response may be spared axillary surgery and minimalize the extent of breast surgery, which will reduce side effects and improve the quality of life after treatment [31,32]. Another possible scenario is to substitute surgery on a completely responding tumor with accelerated partial breast irradiation directed at the former tumor bed [33]. For early-stage breast cancer patients with a negative preoperative indication for systemic therapy, multiparametric 7T breast MRI could be added to the clinical workflow. Within this subgroup, patients with tumors of 2,0 cm or smaller on DCE-MRI and PME PDE score on 31 P-MRS may be suited for less invasive treatment, and the addition of a 7T MRI scan in this subgroup may give new impulse to ongoing studies on less-and non-invasive techniques for primary breast cancer treatment, such as MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound [7,8].",

We linked data from population-based datasets available through the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences to capture perioperative (i.e., before and after definitive breast cancer surgery) imaging studies for patients with primary operable (early-stage) breast cancer in Ontario. Complete study methods are provided in Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj . ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150003/-/DC1), and health codes are available in Appendix 2 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 10.1503/cmaj .150003/-/DC1). \n\nWe used the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify all women with a diagnosis of stage I (I, IA and IB) or stage II (II, IIA and IIB) breast cancer (Table 1) 16 between 2007 and 2012, with 2012 being the last year that data from the Ontario Cancer Registry were available at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The cancer stage recorded in the registry is determined from electronic medical records after all of the patient's results have been received; as such, staging as recorded in the registry is considered the \"best available\" stage. \n\nWe excluded patients who had a prior breast cancer diagnosis and those who had stage 0, III or IV disease, or null or unknown stage disease. We also excluded cases of ductal carcinoma in situ because the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences does not receive information about such cases from the Ontario Cancer Registry. \n\nThe registry cohort was linked with the Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information to identify patients who underwent breast-related surgery. To identify patients with primary operable disease, we restricted the study population to patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent definitive surgery within 3 months of the tissue diagnosis date. This window was selected to exclude patients who might have received preopera tive systemic therapy for initially inoperable, locally advanced disease, since contemporary preoperative chemotherapy regimens are a minimum of 4-5 months in duration. 17 The plan for creating the cohort dataset is shown in Figure 1.",

            "text": "The evaluation of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer begins with the determination of operability. The presence of distant metastases at diagnosis has traditionally been considered a contraindication of surgery. Extensive evaluation to look for metastatic disease is not warranted in asymptomatic patients with early stages because of the low likelihood of identifying metastatic disease. 11 Despite improvements in imaging modalities, clinical staging is still considered by many to be the most helpful and cost-effective. 6,10 aditionally chest radiography, liver ultrasound, and isotope bone scan have been used to rule out chest, liver, and metastases in a patient newly diagnosed with breast cancer. However, the overall yield of these investigations is reportedly low 5,6,8 , especially in earlystage diseases. Fewer than 5% of patients with early breast cancer have bone metastases at presentation 11, and the incidence of liver metastases is even lower. 6,12 ith locally advanced breast cancer (T3-4, N2), the incidence of metastases is much higher, and in those cases, more extensive investigations are justified. 5,8 cording to NCCN guidelines, routine systemic imaging is not indicated for patients with early breast cancer without signs and/or symptoms of metastatic disease. 14 These recommendations are based on studies showing no additional value of these tests in patients with early-stage disease. 15,16,17 In one study evaluating patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer by bone scan, liver USG and chest radiography, metastases were identified by bone scan in 5.1%; 5.6%, and 14% of patients with stage I, II & III disease, respectively and no evidence of metastasis was detected by liver USG or chest radiography in patients with stage I or II diseases. 14 Additional tests like contrast CT scan of the chest, CT scan of the abdomen with contrast, and bone scan may be considered only based on the signs and symptoms. 4 study by Rajiv Samant et al. 18",

            "text": "Surgery has long been a cornerstone of cancer treatment in many types of cancer. Traditionally, intraoperative assessment of the resection margin is largely dependent on visual inspection and palpation of tumors, with the aid of frozen section analysis. Although preoperative imaging can provide gross anatomical information, in situ translation of these images to the operation field is challenging. With the advancement of molecular imaging technology and its clinical application, the gap between preoperative radiologic images and surgical findings has been reduced through image-guided surgery. However, the imaging probes for intraoperative visualization of tumors are not individual tumor-specific. As conventional oncology has moved toward precision oncology with genomic and biological information specific to each tumor, image-guided surgery should also shift toward tumor biology-based image-guided surgery, so-called precision surgery for cancer. In precision cancer surgery, tumors should be analyzed molecularly and genetically to select the optimal imaging probes for individual tumors before surgical resection, beyond the use of predetermined imaging probes for certain types of cancer. This will raise the likelihood of meeting the surgical goals of cancer treatment. In summary, precision cancer surgery can be defined as individual tumor biology-based image-guided surgery.",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is a useful tool for detecting breast cancer. MRI is increasingly used to assess symptoms, screen women at high risk for breast cancer, stage known breast cancers, and screen the contralateral breast in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [1,2]. Several authors have questioned the utility of preoperative MRI, given the possibility of overdiagnosis or false-positives [3,4]. However, others have reported that MRI can reliably predict tumor progression, especially in very dense breasts [5]. \n\nThe specificity and moderate positive predictive value of MRI can limit its effectiveness. A recent meta-analysis about using preoperative MRI to detect multifocal or multicentric cancers in the ipsilateral breast showed that the rate of additional cancer foci being detected ranged from 6 to 34%; the median was 16% and the positive predictive value was 66% [6]. Thus, breast biopsy is necessary in order to definitively diagnose suspicious lesions, especially in MRI-detected lesions that are not detected on initial mammography and ultrasound (US). When lesions detected with MRI are also detected with secondlook US, US-guided biopsy is recommended. \n\nSecond-look US has detection rates that vary substantially [7][8][9][10][11]. Moreover, it is difficult to identify all lesions because examination success depends on the sonographer's experience and skill. Furthermore, lesion characterization with breast US has not reproducible among examiners, which remains a clinical challenge. MRI-guided biopsy has been developed over the past several years to help diagnose conventional B-modeoccult breast lesions detected with MRI. Compared with other modalities, MRI-guided biopsies are less accurate [12][13][14]. Moreover, target sampling is more difficult after MRI-guided biopsy than after biopsy with ultrasound or stereotactic guidance. Radiopathologic correlation after MRI-guided biopsy is particularly challenging when MRI lesions only enhance in vivo and their presence cannot be confirmed in the biopsy specimen, even when biopsy markers have been appropriately placed [12]. \n\nReal-time virtual sonography (RVS) is an MRI/US image fusion technique introduced in 2005.",

            "text": "BackgroundBreast-conserving surgery for breast cancer was developed as a method to preserve healthy breast tissue, thereby improving cosmetic outcomes. Thus far, the primary aim of breast-conserving surgery has been the achievement of tumour-free resection margins and prevention of local recurrence, whereas the cosmetic outcome has been considered less important. Large studies have reported poor cosmetic outcomes in 20-40% of patients after breast-conserving surgery, with the volume of the resected breast tissue being the major determinant. There is clear evidence for the efficacy of ultrasonography in the resection of nonpalpable tumours. Surgical resection of palpable breast cancer is performed with guidance by intra-operative palpation. These palpation-guided excisions often result in an unnecessarily wide resection of adjacent healthy breast tissue, while the rate of tumour-involved resection margins is still high. It is hypothesised that the use of intra-operative ultrasonography in the excision of palpable breast cancer will improve the ability to spare healthy breast tissue while maintaining or even improving the oncological margin status. The aim of this study is to compare ultrasound-guided surgery for palpable tumours with the standard palpation-guided surgery in terms of the extent of healthy breast tissue resection, the percentage of tumour-free margins, cosmetic outcomes and quality of life.Methods/designIn this prospective multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial, 120 women who have been diagnosed with palpable early-stage (T1-2N0-1) primary invasive breast cancer and deemed suitable for breast-conserving surgery will be randomised between ultrasound-guided surgery and palpation-guided surgery. With this sample size, an expected 20% reduction of resected breast tissue and an 18% difference in tumour-free margins can be detected with a power of 80%. Secondary endpoints include cosmetic outcomes and quality of life. The rationale, study design and planned analyses are described.ConclusionThe COBALT trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled study to assess the efficacy of ultrasound-guided breast-conserving surgery in patients with palpable early-stage primary invasive breast cancer in terms of the sparing of breast tissue",

The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Patients with any prior malignancy, inflammatory breast cancer, unknown stage or clinical nodal status, unknown receptor status, or T3 and clinical N1 were excluded. The patients in whom neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was the upfront treatment were excluded, too. 368 patients met the criteria to be included in this study. Patients' data including, age, tumor characteristics, clinical axillary status, results of SLNB and ALND and final pathology reports were abstracted from the medical records. All the patients underwent breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. \n\nAxillary US evaluation was performed in 97 patients prior to the operation. The radiologist determined, the probability of metastatic involvement of the LN, according to the changes in lymph node shape, fatty hilum status, cortical thickness, and cortical echogenicity. US guided biopsy was performed in patients with more than two US detected suspicious LNs. \n\nSLNB was performed in all the patients without axillary US evaluation or less than 2 US detected suspicious LNs. ALND was performed if more than two metastatic SLNs were recognized intra-operatively, or axillary USguided biopsy revealed metastatic involvement. \n\nIn this study we made a comparison between the clinically node negative patients who were evaluated by axillary US prior to the surgery, with the clinically node negative patients who were not evaluated by axillary of patients in this study, these results question the rationale of axillary US guided biopsy in low burden (less than two) suspicious LNs. looking for an imaging modality with a higher sensitivity in detecting the Burdon of axillary metastatic involvement is mandatory.

            "text": "As an important component of modern breast cancer care, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been increasingly used in patients with locally advanced and early-stage breast cancer [1,2]. In addition to providing information on the therapeutic response to NACT regimens, tumor burden can be reduced after NACT, which allows patients who initially require mastectomy to become candidates for breast-conserving surgery [3]. The goal of breast-conserving surgery is to completely remove the breast tumor with clear resection margins and simultaneously maintain the natural breast shape. This requires accurate preoperative tumor localization; however, accurate localization of the tumor extent in patients receiving NACT is challenging because there is often irregular shrinkage, scattering, or even complete remission of the initial tumor after NACT [4]. Currently, there is no guidance device that allows for the accurate estimation of the resection range in breastconserving surgery after NACT. Here, we report the application of a supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based 3-dimensional (3D)-printed breast surgical guide (BSG) for precise breast-conserving surgery in a patient who received NACT.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Every year more than 430 000 new cases are diagnosed in Europe (Ferlay et al 2007) and 250 000 in the USA (Bandi et al 2009). Breast cancer has also a high economic cost, being the second most expensive cancer in Europe (~\u20ac15.0 billion in 2009) (Luengo-Fernandez et al 2013). Although systemic therapy is based on prognostic and predictive markers, complete removal of cancer with or without radiotherapy is the standard treatment for all cases. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is now a commonplace surgical technique for the treatment of early stage cancers (58% in the UK (Jeevan et al 2008) and 60-75% in the USA (Katipamula et al 2009)). BCS aims to remove the tumour but at the same time conserve as much healthy breast tissue as possible. However, one of the main challenges in BCS is the detection of tumour margins during surgery. Preoperative imaging by established oncology imaging techniques (CT or MRI) does not suffice to guide the surgeon to ensure clear margins. Negative margins have been directly associated with lower local recurrence rates. An early study showed that the tumour recurrence rate was as high as 18.2% if positive margins were not re-excised, while the recurrence rates dropped to 3.7% when negative margins were confirmed (Spivack et al 1994). Therefore, the detection of positive margins triggers another surgical intervention, which varies from excision of the positive margin shaves to mastectomy. Recent reports indicate that 11 032 out of the 55 297 of the patients treated by BCS in England during April 2005-March 2008 required secondary surgery (Bennet 2012) while re-excision among women estimates ranged from 30%-60% in the USA (Waljee et al 2008). Thus, the availability of fast and objective techniques that would allow intraoperative assessment of tumour margins and ensure complete removal of the tumour can significantly reduce the rates of secondary surgery. However, frozen section pathology and cytology require lengthy sample preparation procedures that make intra-operative assessment of the entire resection surface impractical for breast conser",

            "text": "A surgical microscope is routinely used to guide delicate surgery by magnifying the surface features of tissue. The development of advanced imaging techniques capable of high resolution and real time visualization of sub-surface tissue structure could provide additional useful information to guide the intervention. For example, this advanced imaging modality could be used intraoperatively to localize a tumor, to help define the tumor margin, and to determine the margin status (positive or negative of tumor cells) and if any residual tumor remains. OCT is very suitable for this application, and can be adapted to the surgical environment to fulfill these current needs. OCT inherently satisfies many of the design requirements for an intraoperative imaging guidance tool, and can also readily be integrated into an existing surgical microscope or implemented as hand-held surgical imaging probes. Thus, the imaging capabilities of OCT permit the intra-operative guidance and monitoring of the surgical procedure, giving immediate imagebased feedback to the surgeon. There are two types of situations where OCT can potentially be used as an intraoperative imaging tool: (1) ex vivo imaging to assess the surgical margin on resected tissue, and (2) in vivo or in situ imaging of tissue before, during, and after surgical resection. Even though OCT image guidance can be applied to many types of surgical oncology procedures, here we introduce as a representative example the use of intraoperative OCT in breast cancer surgery, which has been an emerging surgical application of OCT. Intraoperative OCT can also be used in other solid tumor surgeries including those for brain, lung, liver, kidney, thyroid, pancreatic, and colon cancers, among many others. \n\nIn the past, a standard surgical procedure to treat breast cancers was radical mastectomy. Currently, a breast conserving lumpectomy procedure is often the preferred surgical treatment, with the goal to leave the natural appearance and cosmetic quality of the breast mostly intact while removing the cancerous tissue. After the lumpectomy, the resected tumor mass and tissue are sent to a pathologist, where the margin status is determined using most commonly H&E stained histology and light microscopy. Depending on the institution and how much breast tissue is conserved, relative to the tumor tissue, positive margin and re-operation rates can be as high as 40% [58].",

            "text": "According to the latest report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were more than 2.26 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide in 2020, accounting for about 11.7% of all newly diagnosed cancers. \u22126 However, inadequate detection of breast tumor margins has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. Traditional surgery involves either incomplete removal of the tumor or unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. If the tumor is incomplete, additional tissue excision should be performed. However, this intraoperative evaluation is time-consuming and dependent on the experience of the surgeon. In fact, some studies have shown that about 20\u221250% of breast cancer patients have positive tumor margins after lumpectomy. 7 The presence of multiple positive margins is a risk factor for cancer recurrence and poor survival, and different surgical margins could have different prognostic roles. 8 So, before surgery, basic information such as the size, number, and location of the tumors inside the body has to be confirmed, which requires the imaging technique to have excellent spatial resolution and high sensitivity. 9,10 Other conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are generally difficult to integrate into the operating room. 11 Most importantly, these conventional imaging modalities cannot reliably communicate real-time feedback to the surgeon and have limited tumor specificity. 12 Thus, it is imperative to develop intraoperative imaging techniques to accurately delineate the tumor margin, and the imaging technique with superb sensitivity and prominent signal-to-background ratio is highly desirable intraoperatively. 13 o address this pressing clinical challenge, fluorescence image-guided surgery has emerged as a promising strategy for using fluorescence to highlight tumor tissue. \u221217 In recent years, it has received more and more attention in preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative guidance. However, existing fluorescence imaging methods still have some limitations. For example, indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration for visualization of human tumors, 18 but has been limited to slow blood clearance and lack of specificity. 19,20 herefore, it is urgent to develop targeted and safe contrast agents to guide the resection of cancer tumors.",

            "text": "The benefits of 3D printing are widely recognized and established. One application involves creating a bra-like plastic form that matches the surface of the breasts when the patient is in the supine position [19]. This form is generated through breast scanning using MRI, with the information displayed digitally for the surgeon's reference. A 3D tracker enables precise tumor localization, allowing doctors to easily follow this image-guided process in the operating room. Advantages associated with this method include rapid prototyping, accessibility, structural control, and cost-effectiveness. \n\nMRI-optical-guided breast-conserving surgery utilizing 3D printing offers a precise and accurate solution for removing breast tumors. This technique provides 3D spatial information of the entire tumor volume, in contrast to the single reference point provided by wire localization. A comparison study between patients undergoing wire localization and supine MRI-guided breast-conserving surgery showed that the positive margin rate and resected tissue volume were lower in the MRI-guided excision group [20]. \n\nThe removed tissue from the MRI-guided group was volumetrically smaller (27.5 cm 3 ) than that in the standard BCS group (57.6 cm 3 ). The positive margin rate was lower in the new technique group (12.5%) than in the standard BCS group (39.3%) [20]. The gathered results, created using the data from the study by Sakakibara S. et al., are shown in Figure 1 [20]. Optical scanners allow for the adjustment of MRI scans of the breasts onto the patient on the operating room (OR) table. This approach facilitates the separation of preoperative imaging and surgery, allowing them to occur on different days [21]. The 3D printing technique, coupled with intraoperative tracking technology, ensures the localization of breast cancer with utmost accuracy [21]. A study on the 3D printing technique reveals that the distance of the predicted tumor edges in imaging is very precise, measuring <1 cm [21]. In prospective trials, lumpectomy of palpable cancers tends to be imprecise, resulting in positive margins in 28-29% of cases [22,23]. The likelihood of navigation system mismatch is very low, minimizing errors.",

            "text": "As shown in Figure 3, computer-aided diagnosis involves the use of computer algorithms to analyze medical images, such as mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis [17]. Image analysis and processing techniques can be employed to identify the location, size and shape of lesions, while machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be drilled to recognize pathological features in images [18]. Multimodal fusion techniques that integrate different imaging modalities can also improve diagnostic performance [19][20][21]. Computer-aided treatment utilizes computer technology to optimize various aspects of breast cancer treatment. Radiation therapy planning and simulation can be performed using computer algorithms to determine the optimal radiation dose distribution to healthy tissues [22]. Computer-aided surgery guidance and navigation can aid in surgical planning and execution, as well as in the evaluation of surgical outcomes [23][24][25]. Computer-aided treatment monitoring and evaluation can be used to track the effectiveness of treatments and to predict patient outcomes. Precision medicine and molecular prognostics can be leveraged to evaluate disease progression and treatment efficacy, ultimately guiding the selection of the most appropriate treatment plan [26]. In recent years, several reviews have discussed the integration of technology in breast cancer diagnosis or treatment. In 2018, N I Yassin et al. [9] conducted a systematic review of the machine learning techniques for breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis, highlighting their application in images. Similarly, A Kajala and V Jain [27] also explored the application of machine learning in breast cancer diagnosis, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of computer-aided technologies. Differently, focused on the role of artificial intelligence in the interpretation of breast cancer on MRI [28]. However, the latest examination concentrating on the broad-ranging implications of computer-aided diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer remains limited. This systematic review furnishes an all-encompassing overview of the present status of computer-aided techniques in breast cancer management, and serves as a valuable resource for researchers and healthcare professionals working in this field. Through a thorough literature search and evaluation according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this paper offers insights into recent advancements in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer.",

            "text": "residual invasive disease, the FNR was 14.2% [31]. An analysis from MD Anderson Cancer Center showed that stereo-guided compared to ultrasound-guided VAB was associated with the ability to retrieve more cores and had a higher positive predictive value for residual disease, therefore recommending this modality as the preferred method for identification of patients with pCR for trials testing the safety of omission of surgery [32].\n\nA multi-center pooled analysis of patient level data reported an overall FNR of image-guided breast biopsy of 18.7% across all tumor subtypes and biopsy techniques. However, exploratory subgroup analysis showed that use of a standardized protocol to retrieve \u2265 6 representative VABs of a residual imaging abnormality measuring \u2264 2 cm, could reliably predict residual TN or HER2 positive cancer with a FNR of 4.2% [33\u2022].\n\nRecently, the use of a machine learning algorithm to analyze patient, imaging, tumor, and VAB characteristics has shown excellent results to identify pCR with a FNR of 0% [34\u2022, 35\u2022] suggesting that this \"intelligent VAB\" may be an additional tool in the diagnostic armamentarium to reliably identify patients with TN and HER2 positive breast cancer that would be suitable for surgical de-escalation. However, the wider applicability of this modality in the everyday clinical practice is yet to be determined.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned results on the use of post-NACT image-guided breast biopsy are encouraging, there may be some skepticism around omission of surgery and the potential implications of missing any residual disease. Especially for patients with TN and HER2 positive breast cancer, this could potentially affect adjuvant treatment decision-making and the use or not of capecitabine [10\u2022] or trastuzumab emtansine [9\u2022] respectively. It should be noted though that low volume residual disease in the breast may still be missed even with surgery. Especially since modern practice has moved away from removing the original footprint of the disease towards a more \"risk-adapted\" approach [36] to resect the area of the residual imaging abnormality or the area around the pre-NACT inserted marker clip in case of radiologic complete response.

            "text": "Surgery and radiation remain strong curative modalities for treatment of established solid tumors but treatment failure continues to be a significant problem. The best established role of surgical oncology is the complete removal of the tumor, with an additional strong foundation to question the elective treatment of uninvolved regional lymph nodes in a large variety of tumor types and resection of metastatic disease which is increasingly offered to selected patients with indolent oligometastatic disease (52). Critical to all of them is securing negative surgical margins. \n\nLess invasive technologies and advances in imaging leading to minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgeries are revolutionizing surgical care (5). Likewise, advanced image guidance and motion management strategies are shaping new therapeutic radiation strategies enabling the safe administration of ablative doses of radiation (2). Advanced imaging is fundamental and uniquely placed to serve both margin negativity rates and future radiation strategies. \n\nSurgical margin positivity rate (cancer cells at the edge of tumor resection) has not significantly improved in recent decades and when it does occur prognosis is significantly affected in many tumor types. Margin positivity rates across all types of cancer range from 15 to 60% (53). A recent report on positive surgical margins in the ten most common solid cancers has identified oral cavity cancer with the highest rate with up to 25% of cases, no change over time, with significant effects on tumor relapse and overall survival. For advanced disease, the rates ranged between 20.9% (breast) and 65.5% (prostate) with related worse outcome in seven tumor types (54). Although not a true resistance type, we propose the term \"margin-missing\" effect to characterize this situation which leads to treatment failure and resistance. \n\nFluorescence-guided surgery, which allows intraoperative visualization of tumors, is an evolving image-guided surgical strategy to help differentiate tumor cells from normal surrounding tissues in real time. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging has a higher tumor to background ratio, high tissue penetration (5-10 mm), and little interference from intrinsic fluorescence. Indocyanine green is the most widely used probe in fluorescence-guided surgery although tumor detectability is not very good and optical technology is still evolving (55).",

Retrospective analysis of patient case records does not require formal ethics approval at our institute. The study was conducted according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient details were obtained from the case records. Histopathological confirmation of breast cancer was established with a core needle biopsy of the primary breast tumor. Prognostic markers like estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (Her2) were analyzed on the biopsy specimen using immunohistochemistry and reported according to standard guidelines. Patients with Her 2 2\u00fe could not undergo fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing since it was not done at our center at that time. Staging workup done for all patients included chest X-ray, ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis, and bone scan. Additional imaging like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was done if there was suspicion of distant metastasis. The staging was done as per the American Joint Committee of Cancer Staging 7th edition. Patients with stage I and II disease were classified as early breast cancer, stage III as locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), and stage IV as metastatic breast cancer. Treatment decisions for patients were taken by the hospital multidisciplinary breast cancer tumor board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before starting the planned treatment. Patients with early breast cancer underwent surgery followed by systemic treatments (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) and adjuvant radiation therapy. Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or breast conservation surgery (BCS) was the preferred surgical technique used. Patients with LABC received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and sequential radiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. 12 Chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting included three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by three cycles docetaxel or six cycles of paclitaxel and epirubicin or four cycles adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by four cycles of paclita",

            "text": "Tis distinction is important because the management of CLCIS does not require achieving negative margins, whereas negative margins are recommended for FLCIS [11]. \n\nIn the present study, all of the invasive cancers were early stage (87.5% Stage I) with macroscopic lymph node involvement in only one case (12.5% Stage II). Although the rate of lymph node involvement was low, information regarding lymph node involvement may still be important for guiding adjuvant systemic therapy recommendations particularly in premenopausal women and extent of adjuvant radiation therapy after lumpectomy and mastectomy. Terefore, SLNB should be discussed and considered at the time of surgery when mastectomy is performed or when the area to be excised is large and may preclude SLNB at a second surgery. \n\nOne of the major limitations of this analysis is that it is a single institutional, retrospective study that only included 18 cases of FLCIS followed by SE. Tis limited the ability to identify meaningful clinical features that were associated with higher upgrade rates on SE. Terefore, a larger number of patients are necessary to confrm the association between suspicious calcifcations and target lesion size on imaging with upgrade rates on SE. However, the strength of the study is that the cases were managed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians with advanced training. Fellowship-trained breast pathologists and radiologists reviewed all cases in this study, applying careful pathologic-radiologic correlation. In addition, the SE excisions were primarily performed by surgeons with surgical oncology or breast fellowship training who are more familiar with high-grade variants of LCIS leading to appropriate consideration for excision and judicious use of SLNB.",

In the study period, 10 142 patients underwent breast surgery for management of DCIS or stage I or stage II breast cancer. For this cohort, 6321 advanced imaging tests (BS, CT, MRI or PET) were identified during the staging window among 3845 patients. Of these advanced imaging tests, 1437 were excluded for the following reasons: advanced breast imaging with MRI (173); CT/MRI angiography for planning of autologous reconstruction (50); BS, CT, MRI or PET scanning completed for an indication not related to the breast cancer diagnosis (1185); and CT scanning completed for reasons unknown (29). Furthermore, 651 tests were excluded as the patient     was reported to have symptoms or signs worrisome for distant disease. These 651 tests were among 541 patients, meaning that 5.2% of the patients in our study cohort underwent screening for metastatic disease for a potentially valid reason. Finally, 546 tests were excluded because of categorization as a follow-up test. This left 3687 tests having been completed for routine staging among 2887 patients. Hence, the incidence of patients who underwent routine screening for metastases was 28.5%, and the mean number of tests per patient was 1.3 (standard deviation 0.5). The incidence of routine screening was 3.7% among patients with DCIS, 16.1% among those with stage I breast cancer and 51.4% among those with stage II breast cancer (Table 2). Patients were most commonly subjected to BS, followed by CT and then PET; none of our patients had an MRI for routine screening (Table 2). Of the 2887 patients who underwent routine screening, 546 follow-up tests (most commonly CT and MRI) were completed during the staging window among 438 patients (15.2%). Furthermore, we identified 28 patients who underwent a nonbreast image-guided biopsy (1.0%).",

Systemic therapy administered before surgery may reduce the size and cellularity of the tumour, presenting unique challenges for surgeons, including increased difficulty in identifying the tumour bed and ensuring complete macroscopic and microscopic surgical excision. Collaborative interactions between medical oncologists, pathologists, and are essential to determine the necessity for, and logistics of, surgical intervention. Moreover, simple techniques such as the use of tissue marker clips to indicate tumour location at the time of diagnosis ensures appropriate imaging after nst and can greatly improve surgical outcomes. As the first point of referral, surgeons will continue to play a pivotal role in neoadjuvant treatment selection and clinical trial accrual. Surgeons order molecular analyses of the diagnostic core-needle biopsies [estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), and her2 status] to guide subsequent treatment and arrange for the insertion of tissue marker clips to maximize breast-conserving surgery options after neoadjuvant therapy. Surgeons also assess the status of axillary breast tissue, typically by ultrasonography, before nst to guide the surgical approach (sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection). It is therefore imperative that surgeons continue to cultivate knowledge of nst to ensure optimal patient care. \n\nRadiation therapy is the third element of the neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment strategy. Despite the importance of radiation therapy in the tri-modal approach to breast cancer treatment, evidence to guide its use after neoadjuvant therapy is limited, particularly in instances in which a mastectomy is required. Phase iii trials to date have focused primarily on the use of radiation therapy after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Consequently, there are no well-established guidelines for radiation therapy after nst. Studies involving patients treated with nst demonstrate that clinical stage before nst and pathologic response or extent of residual disease after nst are both independent predictors for locoregional failure 9,10 .",

            "text": "Breast cancer, a malignancy that originates from the mammary gland, is one of the root causes of cancer-related fatalities among female populations worldwide [1]. The etiology of breast cancer is multifactorial and encompasses a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors [2]. The early detection and effective treatment of breast cancer is paramount for enhancing the disease prognosis. Regular breast cancer screening, such as mammography, as well as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can increase the likelihood of diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage [3,4]. Moreover, prompt and appropriate treatment can impede the advancement of the disease and curtail the likelihood of metastasis. Effective treatment of breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses a range of therapeutic modalities, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, as shown in Figure 1 [5][6][7]. The choice of treatment depends on several factors, including the stage and classification of breast cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and personal preferences. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend towards the integration of computer-aided techniques in the field of breast cancer, with the purpose of improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment [8,9]. Computer technology has been integrated throughout the entire process of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, as depicted in Figure 2. Computer-aided techniques have revolutionized the field of breast cancer management, offering an array of benefits that include improved diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning and simulation, and reduced treatment-related side effects [10][11][12]. These techniques leverage advanced image analysis and processing algorithms, as well as machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to provide a more sophisticated and accurate methodology in diagnosing and treating breast cancer [13][14][15][16]. As shown in Figure 3, computer-aided diagnosis involves the use of computer algorithms to analyze medical images, such as mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis [17].",

            "text": "Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally (1). It affects individuals across all age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and geographical locations, making it a universal public health challenge. Each year, over 1.67 million new cases are reported worldwide, with a prevalence rate of 20-25% (2). Notably, approximately 6-10% of women present with advanced stage IV disease at the time of initial diagnosis, and a further 20-30% of those diagnosed at earlier stages eventually develop metastatic breast cancer (3). Early detection and accurate staging are critical to improving patient outcomes, guiding therapeutic decisions, and enhancing overall survival rates. Several imaging modalities have been employed in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer, including mammography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) (4). Among these, CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT have gained prominence for their ability to assess the extent of disease spread. Histopathology, derived from biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), remains the gold standard for confirming malignancy and verifying metastatic involvement (5). While CT provides high-resolution anatomical detail and is widely used in oncology for identifying structural abnormalities in organs such as the lungs, liver, and bones, it has notable limitations. These include difficulty in detecting small or immature lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant findings, especially in bone metastases or axillary lymph node involvement (6). In contrast, 18F-FDG PET/CT combines both functional and anatomical imaging by assessing glucose metabolism, which is typically elevated in malignant tissues. This modality has demonstrated superiority in identifying occult metastases, particularly in the liver, bone marrow, and distant lymph nodes, which might be missed on CT alone (7). Moreover, PET/CT plays a pivotal role in monitoring response to therapy, allowing clinicians to assess whether ongoing treatment is effective or requires adjustment.",

            "text": "Breast-conserving surgery has been accepted as a standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer. [14] It is used to treat more than 50% of patients with early breast cancer in western countries. [15,16] The present study found that the rate of breast-conserving surgeries in member units of the CSBrS was 14.6%. Although the rate had increased since 2008 (11.88%) based on a multi-center study in China, [9] our findings suggest that this rate should continue to increase further. This surgery was reported at a rate of 8.9% in Northeast China and 47.1% in South China, illustrating regional differences in the acceptance of breastconserving surgery by doctors and patients.\n\nThe rate of breast-conserving surgeries is reported to be low in some low-and middle-income countries due to the advanced stage at diagnosis. [17,18] In recent years, with advances in screening technology and health awareness, the detection of early breast cancer in China has increased. [19] However, the rate of detection is still low compared to that in developed countries, [20,21] which was an important factor limiting the implementation of breastconserving surgery in China. Neoadjuvant therapy is an important strategy to improve the rate of breast-conserving surgery, and its safety was confirmed in the TBCRC017 study. [22] The NSABP B18 study demonstrated comparable long-term survival rates in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast-conserving surgery when compared to those who underwent early breast-conserving surgery. [23] This study also showed that only 10.2% of Chinese patients underwent breastconserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, which was lower than the proportion reported in developed countries. [23,24] Patients play a vital role in the choice of surgery for breast cancer, and nearly 80% of them were directly or indirectly involved in choosing the surgical approach. [25] Concerns regarding the risk of recurrence and the effects of post-operative radiation therapy made patients more likely to choose mastectomy over breast-conserving surgery. [25] A questionnaire survey investigated 1264 patients with early-stage breast cancer in China and found that only 7.",

An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease [44]. OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction [45,46] (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness.",

Invasive lobular carcinoma is the second most prevalent type of breast carcinoma with an incidence rate of 5% and 15% with high propensity for multifocal manifestation of disease [4]. \n\nDiagnosis and assessment of ILC has always been challenging and problematic, as it tends to be clinically silent and radiologically elusive in many cases. Surgical outcomes for patients with early-stage ILC remain worse than the surgical outcomes for patients with IDC, with higher rates of positive margins and increased need for repeat operations and completion mastectomies [14]. \n\nThe role of imaging in the evaluation of breast lesions is undeniable, because an early detection and accurate diagnosis of multiple breast cancers is of paramount importance for deciding the extent of surgical procedures for adequate clearance of the tumor, ensuring a lower rate of advanced metastatic disease at diagnosis and a longer overall survival [8,15]. \n\nFormerly the standard way to assess suspicious lesions included sonomammography and image-guided needle biopsy, with limitations including underestimation in patients with dense parenchyma, small lesions and patients with ILC that presents as subtle To date, breast imaging is facing the challenge of running faster than breast cancer, in order to offer a personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis and overall survival. The application of molecular techniques and artificial intelligence may allow breast imaging to play a crucial role in breast cancer care, beyond the detection [16]. \n\nPEM is a new and advanced molecular breast imaging technique that, using a radio tracker, detects biological processes, including cellular behaviors performed for metabolism and cell proliferation [8]. \n\nPEM is believed to obtain a more accurate detection of small breast lesions, particularly in women with high breast density, thanks to the combination of an early metabolic evaluation provided by FDG high spatial resolution. Detection of sub-centimetric breast tumors might lead to the identification of multiple occult lesions that evade conventional diagnosis [11,15]. \n\nAccording to our knowledge, there has been no dedicated study for assessment of PEM performance in ILC.",

Patients may present for screening purposes or with breast symptoms. In the presence of a symptom such as a lump, triple assessment is undertaken, which includes clinical evaluation, mammography, ultrasound and pathological examination (cytology with or without histology). This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of these 3 modalities (clinical palpation, ultrasound and mammogram) in assessing the size of palpable breast cancer lesions compared to pathological measurement, which is an accepted gold standard. Size plays an influential role in breast cancer assessment and management in 3 main aspects, clinical staging, choice of surgical technique, feasibility and planning of non-surgical technique (3). Clinical staging aided by imaging drives the decision for mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, both of which are significant life-changing procedures for the patient. Nonsurgical treatments include neoadjuvant chemotherapy and upcoming technique of ablation of early stage tumours . These methods rely heavily on imaging, especially in ablation in which imaging is the sole guide to planning and execution of treatment (4). \n\nA prospective study to compare ultrasound, mammogram and clinical breast tumour size measurements with pathological measurement was carried out from December 2009 until December 2011 in the Department of Biomedical Imaging and Department of Surgery at University Malaya Medical Centre.",

Traditionally, chemotherapy has been administered to breast cancer patients after surgery, followed by radiation and hormonal therapy. We now acknowledge that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into molecular subtypes. Systemic therapies are thus often tailored to biologically distinct patient populations, allowing for a more individualized approach to therapy. Molecular and immunohistochemical data-such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) and hormone receptor status-acquired at the time of diagnosis or surgery provide important information to guide the administration of systemic, targeted, and hormonal therapies, and have resulted in some important breakthroughs in the treatment of breast cancer. \n\nMounting evidence suggests that, in addition to advances in individualized systemic breast cancer therapy, a shift in the traditional sequencing of treatment modalities may also improve outcomes in early breast cancer patients. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (nst), typically chemotherapy delivered before surgery, has traditionally been reserved for locally advanced breast cancer (labc) or inflammatory breast cancer (ibc); now, it is considered to be as effective as adjuvant chemotherapy for earlier-stage disease 1,2 .

For a large proportion of women with early localized breast cancer, the recommended treatment is breast-conserving surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy, whole breast external-beam radiation therapy, which requires daily therapy. The purpose of this study is to analyses the cost-effectiveness of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) compares with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for early-stage breast cancer. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines used in this study. We search all articles from June 30, 2000, to June 30, 2022, in PubMed, Cochrane, ProQuest, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing, Allied Health Literature and non-English articles were excluded. We included cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. This study included 1750 published studies, ten studies were entirely met the inclusion criteria. In six studies, IORT was associated with lower costs and higher effectiveness than EBRT. Inconclusion, IORT can be a potential cost-saving strategy to the health systems for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.",

            "text": "Overall survival was not significantly different between breast conserving treatment and radical mastectomy in stage II breast, which was verified by EORTC 10801 trial [1]. Breast conserving surgery is currently accepted as the therapy of choice by numerous surgeons and patients. It has been confirmed that breast conserving surgery followed by postoperative breast adjuvant radiotherapy is the normal treatment for proper patients with early breast tumor. However, the cosmetic results and complications that occur after the use of the standard breast-conserving therapy protocol, which consists of lumpectomy and a 6-week adjuvant radiotherapy course [2][3][4], pose a major concern [5]. Therefore, there is a need for a more minimally invasive treatment protocol. \n\nCompared with traditional surgical therapy, the image-guided ablative therapies, which contain microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryoablation, have distinct advantages that cover superior cosmetic results, less complications and mortality, cooperativity with other cancer treatments, the capacityto complete ablative treatment in an outpatient basis, convenience for simultaneous imaging monitoring, smaller expense of treatment and reproducible [6]. Compared to the other thermal ablative modalities, percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) has particular advantages, such as preferable heating of cystic masses, bigger tumor ablation range, uniformly higher temperatures inside the tumor, shorter ablation duration, advanced convection profile, capicity to use multiple applicators and minor pain [7][8][9][10]. At present, PMWA has been extensively used for the treatment of tumors located in the lung, liver, bone, adrenal gland and kidney. Moreover, duo to the special anatomical location of breast where is between ectopectoralis and skin, microwave ablation is more suitable for breast tumor than others solid tumors. We have proved that USguided PMWA is a promising treatment for solitary breast cancers [11]. \n\nSimilar to the standard process that breast conservation therapy has to be followed by intraoperative or postoperative radiotherapy [4], the microwave ablation also has to be followed by a postoperative radiotherapy or others ionization therapy.",

Therefore, it seems plausible that the use of 18 F-FDG PET scans can improve the management of breast cancer patients. Notably, there was substantial heterogeneity across the included studies for changes in both staging and management. We found that clinical stage, tumor grade, and age were significant factors that affect heterogeneity. We have reported the differential pooled proportions of stage changes according to patient's initial stage. Our result is partly consistent with current clinical guidelines in that the use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT is recommended in advanced stage breast cancer, [2][3][4] in that clinical stage changed in approximately one third of patients with stage III (34%) disease. However, our results also indicate that a nonnegligible proportion of patients in stage II (20%) and even in stage I (11%) can undergo stage changes and may benefit from the use of PET scans. These values are not significantly different from the reported proportions of stage migration from clinical stage I after 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer 51,52 or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 53 for which 18 F-FDG PET/CT is recommended by guidelines 54,55 and covered by Medicare. 6 Well-designed prospective studies (which could not be included in our meta-analysis because of overlapping study populations) reported that 18 F-FDG PET/CT changed the stage in 52% (61/117) of patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer 56 and in 17% (22/131) of patients with stage IIA to IIIA disease. 57 Invasive tumors with higher histologic grade exhibit higher 18 F-FDG uptake, which increased detectability of lesions. 58,59 Grade III tumors are more frequently associated with extra-axillary nodal metastasis, 21 for which PET scans show superior diagnostic efficacy compared with other conventional staging modalities; this may significantly influence planning fields for surgery or RT. 41",

Breast cancer outcomes correlate with the degree to which 1) cancers are detected early, 2) cancers can be diagnosed correctly, and 3) proper multimodality treatment can be provided in a timely fashion. Cancer prevention through health behavior modification may influence breast cancer incidence in LMCs. Diagnosing breast cancer at earlier stages will reduce breast cancer mortality. Programs to promote breast self-awareness and clinical breast examination and resource-adapted mammographic screening are important early detection steps. Screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality, but is cost prohibitive in some settings. Breast imaging, initially with ultrasound and, at higher resource levels with diagnostic mammography, improves preoperative diagnostic assessment and permits image-guided needle sampling.

Numerous randomized controlled studies have demonstrated an average 30% reduction in mortality through screening women over 50 years of age [5]. Additionally, screening has shown a 16% reduction in breast cancer mortality among women aged 39-49 years [6]. \n\nPercutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy has emerged as a reliable alternative to surgical biopsy for obtaining a histological diagnosis. This less invasive procedure offers advantages such as quick performance, fewer complications (such as hematoma and infection), and cost-effectiveness [7]. \n\nTo standardize mammography reporting, clarify interpretations, and enhance communication between clinicians, the American College of Radiology (ACR) developed the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS) in 1993 [8,9]. Furthermore, BI-RADS has demonstrated improvements in the positive predictive value (PPV) of breast biopsies [10]. Acknowledging the increased use of breast sonography, the ACR recently introduced a BI-RADS lexicon for breast sonography to standardize lesion characterization [11]. \n\nWithin the BI-RADS classification, category 4 is reserved for findings that do not exhibit the classic appearance of malignancy but still raise enough suspicion to warrant a recommendation for biopsy, as malignancy cannot be excluded based on imaging alone. Category 3 assessments have a ceiling of 2% likelihood of malignancy, while category 5 assessments have a floor of 95% [11,12]. \n\nFew studies have examined the PPV of category 4 lesions.",

            "text": "Great diversity in the tumors of breast often describes the heterogeneity of the disease that requires various tumor profiles, specific diagnosis, and certain degrees of treatment sensitivities. Age is the main factor for increasing breast cancer incidence and it became the second leading cause of death in women. Breast cancer is associated with multiple tumor entities, each one is characterized with distinctive morphology, definitive behavior and clinical inference. 1 An increased risk of breast cancer is seen with additional breast lesions which are generally not diagnosed at early stages or sometimes not even with conventional diagnostic tools. Some of the previous studies on mastectomy specimens revealed that the associated breast lesions occurred in the ipsilateral breast and few of them occurred in the contra lateral breast. 2,3 Treatment of cancer type varies with the multiple number of cancer sites, recurrence, and the number of lesions. Here imaging plays a crucial role, therefore it is essential to identify, evaluate the disease and associated risks preoperatively through screening, diagnosis, image guided biopsy, treatment planning and follow up. \n\nMammograms are the best used diagnostic method for early detection of breast cancer but the problem persisting with this method is that the lesions are detectable if the size is larger than 1.5cms and sometimes there is a chance of giving false positive results. 4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an extensively used method now for the detection of preoperative breast cancer because of its high sensitivity. 5 recisely they are used to diagnose the index cancer and additional breast lesions when compared to the conventional imaging techniques. 6,7,8 This technique also calculates the high negative predictive value and further characterizes the appropriate equivocal findings of breast lesions. 9 he basic version of MR tissue characterization does not play a major role in the differentiation of other lesions as there is a significant overlap between benign and malignant lesions. So, it is crucial to characterize additional lesions over detecting them with advanced MRI methods like Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI. 10 Lesions that are present in different quadrants or in the contralateral breast should be identified preoperatively and checked for their malignant nature.

            "text": "Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most diagnosed cancer worldwide (approximately 2.3 million in 2020), accounting for 24.5% of all cancer cases [1]. For early breast cancer, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has become the preferred surgical treatment strategy, while locally advanced breast cancer is treated generally via BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) that can downstage the tumour as well as reduce tumour size [2,3]. However, NACT can cause the original tumour to shrink or scatter remarkably, imposing a significant challenge on the preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent, thus leading to intraoperative incomplete or excessive tumour resection [4][5][6]. Inadequate resection increases the probability of recurrence and reoperation, whilst excessive resection deteriorates cosmetic outcomes. Consequently, accurate preoperative localisation of residual tumour extent and margin after the treatment of NACT is of great importance to patients eligible to undergo BCS, particularly those with locally advanced breast cancers. \n\nOf many imaging modalities commonly employed to determine tumour extent and location, such as computed tomography, mammography, sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI is considered more suitable for identifying residual tumours after NACT due to its higher accuracy [5,7,8]. A vital difficulty of BCS is how to accurately map the digitalised tumour information acquired from the aforementioned medical imaging methods onto the patient's breast. To address this issue, various surgical guidance devices, including wire-guided localisation, clip marker insertion and radio-guided localisation, have been developed for aiding preoperative breast localisation and surgical excision [9][10][11][12]. However, each localisation technique above possesses its own clinical limitations due to intrinsic disadvantages in aspects of localisation accuracy, procedural complexity, invasiveness to the patient and safety, and a detailed review is available from Corsi et al. [13][14][15].",

Therefore, the 5-year survival differs markedly in different regions of the world, declining from more than 80% in North America and Sweden to~60% in middle-income countries, and less than 40% in low-income countries [26].\n\nThe incidence of breast cancer increases with age, affecting one in every 2525 women at the age of 30 years, but one every 10 women at the age of 80 years. There is an alarming increase in incidence worldwide not only because of increased detection/reporting, but because of an actual increase in incidence (by about 30-40% from the 1970s to the 1990s), including more advanced stages. In the USA, breast cancer incidence (97/100 000 in white women) is over three-fold higher than that in Asian countries (27/100 000).\n\nThe imaging modalities available for screening purposes (i.e. for examining 'apparently' healthy individuals in certain risk groups to identify a disease in an early, asymptomatic stage) or for diagnostic purposes (i.e. patients with symptoms or individuals with some abnormality detected during screening) include X-ray mammography (digital mammography in most instances, in some cases complemented by computer-aided diagnosis), US, mammoscintigraphy, MRI, CT and galactography. The subsequent step towards correctly diagnosing a breast lesion is usually cytology or biopsy, generally aided by imaging as in USguided fine-needle cytology, US-guided core biopsy, stereotactic core biopsy and needle placement for excisional biopsy. An efficient breast-screening unit cannot rely on a single imaging modality, but rather on the possibility of integrating during a single session the basic procedure (e.g. mammography) with other complementary procedures (e.g. US).",

This can be attributed to the lack of tools currently available to enable simultaneous, multi-modal image assessment. In their prospective view of breast cancer imaging for detection and diagnosis, however, Karellas and Vedantham (2008) suggest that: ''From the technological perspective, in addition to improvements with each modality, we are likely to observe an increasing trend towards multi-modality systems that combine the relative strengths of each modality''. This paper addresses this issue by describing a method to spatially correlate breast MG and MRI. Finally, another potential application of MRI to MG registration is its use to facilitate X-ray stereotactic biopsy for patients that have a second-look mammography following an MRI, for lesions that were initially considered mammographically-occult. In this case, identifying correspondences between MRI and MG could be a valuable tool to enable mammographically guided, rather than MRI-guided biopsies to be performed; the latter generally being more expensive, time consuming and not widely available (Heywang-K\u00f6brunner et al., 2009).\n\nIdentifying corresponding regions between X-ray mammograms and MR images can be problematic, due to the differences in dimensionality and image appearance, and the large breast deformation between the two modalities. Women are lying prone in the MR scanner with their breasts pendulous, while during X-ray mammography acquisitions women are standing with their breast compressed between two plates. In addition, for MG, typically two images are acquired, one Cranio-Caudal (CC) and one Medio-Lateral Oblique (MLO) view. An automated MRI to X-ray registration algorithm would be a valuable tool that could help radiologists in the diagnosis and management of breast cancer.\n\nPreviously, authors have used feature-based techniques for this task (Behrenbruch et al., 2003;Marti et al., 2004). However the selection of corresponding, distinctive features from MR and X-ray images is particularly problematic for breast images, due to the lack of anatomically distinctive, internal landmarks.\n\nA patient-specific FE modelling approach that simulates mammographic compression was initially proposed by Ruiter et al. (2006). This implementation used",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in Western countries [1]. For patients with primary breast cancer, preoperative staging is used to determine the most appropriate disease management for each patient and provides important prognostic information. The presence of distant metastatic disease is a major prognostic factor since women with metastases have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 25% compared with approximately 80% survival rate for women with localized disease [2]. \n\nESMO guidelines for staging recommend chest radiograph with abdominal ultrasound or CT and bone scan for the detection of metastatic disease in patients with clinically positive axillary nodes, large tumours (eg. > 5cm), or clinical signs, symptoms or laboratory values suggesting the presence of metastatic disease [3]. \n\nIn recent years, more advanced investigative modalities have been used for breast cancer staging including computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and combined PET-CT. These modalities have been shown to improve the accurate staging and management of patients with advanced disease when compared to traditional modalities (eg. chest radiograph, ultrasound, bone (Figure 1). The systematic review confirmed that PET-CT is superior to conventional imaging (Table 2). However the systematic review failed to demonstrate any significant difference between PET-CT and CT TAP in terms of sensitivity/specificity however there was significant heterogeneity across the studies involved regarding patient selection and disease stage. This may explain the discordance in findings between the meta-analysis and the systematic review. \n\nAlthough many studies have compared both PET-CT and CT-TAP to conventional imaging, few have compared these modalities with each other and it is not surprising that such variety exists. The lack of consensus on which staging investigation(s) should be performed at such a critical point in the patient's care is likely a reflection of the lack of available evidence. \n\nIndications for imaging and stage of disease differed between studies in this meta-analysis; Piperkova et al, in a retrospective review, reported on 49 patients who underwent imaging for staging, restaging or assessment of treatment response [5].",

The integration of the various therapeutic modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, supportive therapies) and the collaboration of different specialists within multidisciplinary teams are fundamental to ensure the best treatment for each patient and achieve the best outcome [4,5]. \n\nIn early breast cancer (stage I-II-III) patients, the knowledge of the clinical and biological prognostic factors [Tumor size, lymph node status, Grading, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PgR) status, proliferative index (Ki67 value) and HER2 status] is very important in order to identify the most appropriate treatment options and decide about the start of NAT or refer the patient directly to the surgeon considering later an adjuvant therapy. \n\nToday, neoadjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and for patients with resectable breast cancer. In locally advanced breast cancer patients, NAT is administered with the aim of performing surgery on patients who are not candidates for surgery yet.",

            "text": "All these imaging techniques have their advantages but also some inherent disadvantages, which is why their features and particularities need to be very well known by radiologists. For the best outcome for a patient diagnosed with breast cancer, at each stage (from suspicion and diagnosis to posttreatment surveillance and disease recurrence), the optimal imaging tool should be chosen. Nevertheless, there is no correct method or steps to follow when dealing with this disease, because each patient has their own particularities and development of neoplasia. Thus, the radiologists have to decide on their own how to juggle these techniques and determine the best time to use each one of them. \n\nFor better management of this disease, and based on the articles chosen in this review, we developed an algorithm using the imaging techniques. First of all, for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer, mammography should be used for patients over 40 years old or even younger, who have a high risk of cancer development. If these criteria are not applicable, ultrasound is a good alternative both in screening and diagnosis. MRI plays an important role in women with dense breasts or implants and has a high sensitivity in detecting neoplasia. \n\nFor a diagnosis confirmation, ultrasound-guided breast biopsy and also biopsy using other imaging techniques, such as mammography or MRI are preferred over open surgery. Besides its role in confirming the diagnosis, ultrasound can be used for the cryoablation of small malign masses. \n\nAlthough PET-CT is not as sensitive as the above-mentioned imaging methods in detecting the primary tumor, it is used with great results in detecting the tumor extension and staging the disease and can also be used for posttreatment surveillance and follow up. \n\nIn the figure below, we summarized the steps to be followed from screening to the surveillance of breast tumors, focused on the best way to use the most popular imaging techniques (Figure 2). Based on the information gathered from all of the studied articles, the following scheme is the most used \"imaging algorithm\" when dealing with breast cancers.",

            "text": "One of the most prevalent malignancies in women globally, breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the breast cells. For treatment to be successful, early detection is essential. A painless lump or thickening in the breast or underarm, changes in breast size, shape, or skin texture, an inexplicable nipple discharge, and skin redness or dimpling that resembles an orange peel are common signs of breast cancer. These symptoms may have benign causes as well as being suggestive of breast cancer. As a result, any enduring or strange modification to the breasts must be examined right away by a medical expert [2]. \n\nTreatment for breast cancer varies depending on the stage, type, and characteristics of the tumor. The primary treatment modalities include surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy (such as Herceptin for HER2-positive cancers), and hormone therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancers). Often, a combination of these treatments is used to effectively combat the cancer. Additionally, advancements in personalized medicine have led to more tailored treatments based on the specific genetic and molecular characteristics of the tumor. Early-stage breast cancer typically has a better prognosis, but advancements in treatment have also improved outcomes for advanced-stage cancers. Regular breast self-exams, clinical breast exams, and mammograms are essential for early detection and increased chances of successful treatment [1]. \n\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 422 3 of 28",

Despite this, breast cancer still remains the most common malignancy and dreaded disease in women in the United States (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2003). Progress has been made, nevertheless, in humanizing the horrors that formerly devastated the body and psyche (Andersen et al., 2008). Anatomically, breasts are hemispherical in shape and are made up of glandular tissues embedded in connective tissue which lie over the pectoral muscles. Adipose tissues lie between the skin and the glandular tissues, and the size of breasts depend on the adipose tissues. As a woman ages, the adipose tissues of the breasts may become more prominent than the glandular tissues, and the breasts may become softer and begin to be flaccid. Breast cancer is more prevalent in elderly women as they age. The challenges that come with age and the aforementioned breast structure complicates the treatment of breast cancer particularly with radiation. The most common site of breast cancer is the upper outer quadrant followed by the central area. Curative treatment of breast cancer include combined modality treatment, which incorporates surgery (radical or conservative) and adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, external beam irradiation and brachytherapy implantation. The selection of a particular procedure or a combination of procedures depends on established prognostic factors such as stage, grade and extension. In general, surgery is indicative if the tumor is confined to the breast with no extension through the lymphatic system. Brachytherapy implants are used for early stage cancers, either alone or in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy. Patients who require breast conservation using surgical procedures are often potential candidates for brachytherapy as well (Calle et al., 1978; Fisher et al., 1977; Harris et al., 1981; Levene, 1977; Pierquin et al., 1980; Prosnitz et al., 1977); however, patients with extensive tumors are not good candidates for brachytherapy implantation. Many women with early-stage breast cancer are treated with breast-conserving surgery (lumpect",

            "text": "Background Breast cancer treatment has rapidly changed in the last few years. Particularly, treatment of patients with axillary nodal involvement has evolved after publication of several randomized clinical trials. Omitting axillary lymph node dissection in selected early breast cancer patients with one or two positive sentinel nodes did not compromise overall survival nor regional disease control in these trials. Hence, either excluding or identifying extensive axillary nodal involvement becomes increasingly important. Purpose To evaluate whether the current diagnostic modalities can accurately identify or exclude extensive axillary nodal involvement. Evaluated modalities were axillary ultrasound, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, MRI, and PET/CT. Methods A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed databases up to June 2019. The search strategy included terms for breast cancer, lymph nodes, and the different imaging modalities. Only articles that reported pathological N-stage or the total number of positive axillary lymph nodes were considered for inclusion. Studies with patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy were excluded. Conclusion There is no evidence that any of the current preoperative axillary imaging modalities can accurately exclude or identify breast cancer patients with extensive nodal involvement. Both negative PET/CT and negative MRI scans (with gadolinium-based contrast agents) are promising in excluding extensive nodal involvement. Larger studies should be performed to strengthen this conclusion. False-negative rates of axillary ultrasound and ultrasound-guided needle biopsy are too high to rely on negative results of these modalities in excluding extensive nodal involvement.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death among women overall. Early diagnosis through screening, alongside treatment advancements, have substantially reduced breast cancer mortality [1]. The screening and diagnosis process is primarily conducted using mammography, ultrasound, and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Each of these modalities has its own unique advantages and uses, depending on the patient's age, breast tissue density, medical history, and the tumor's stage and type [2]. \n\nUltrasound is a major tool in breast cancer diagnosis. It is probably the most costeffective medical imaging modality available today. Stemming from its high availability and from the fact that it is considered hazardless, it has found applications in almost all fields of medicine. Nonetheless, even though it was introduced to medicine about eighty years ago and despite the enormous progress in the fields of electronics and computers, one factor remained unchanged: ultrasound images are characterized by a granulated appearance with poor a SNR and substantial speckle noise. Furthermore, image quality is subject to the skills of the scanner operator and the manner in which the probe is attached and pressed against the tissue [3]. As a result, anatomical visualization is relatively inferior when compared to mammography or MRI. Consequently, the clinical information is compromised, and image interpretation relies substantially on the skills of the practicing radiologist [4,5]. \n\nOn the positive side, since ultrasound image acquisition rate enables real-time imaging, ultrasound is commonly used during surgery to bridge the gap between the preliminary radiological images acquired before surgery and the actual area of tissue operated on [6][7][8]. Still, there is often a challenge in identifying the corresponding pathology of interest in the anatomical cut. The difficulty stems mainly from two reasons. The first problem is the potential mismatch between the spatial orientation of the image acquired before surgery relative to the actual cut and the physical position of the patient at the time of the image acquisition. Relating to this problem, ultrasound offers an advantage over other imaging modalities. Since ultrasound scans are conducted by a handheld probe, they can yield arbitrary cross-sectional images from various directions in real time.",

            "text": "Precise information regarding tumor extent, lymph node (LN) status, and multifocality is of great importance in breast cancer treatment and prognosis, as well as, recurrence prediction. In particular, negative margins in breast-conserving therapy significantly affect local tumor recurrence [1,2]. Axillary LN status is also a major prognostic indicator and acts as a guide, in terms of the need for adjuvant chemotherapy, in breast-cancer patients [3]. Multimodal breast imaging techniques for the preoperative assessment of breast cancer staging are available, especially mammography (MMG), ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). There are several studies comparing the diagnostic performance of these modalities, with breast MRI reported to be the most accurate imaging modality for assessment of tumor extent and LN status [4][5][6][7]. \n\nBreast MRI, however, has various specificity, and high false positive rates, when detecting breast cancers and also tends to overestimate tumor extent [8][9][10][11]. Thus, physicians have not achieved a consensus on the utilization of MRI staging prior to surgery. Evaluation of breast cancer using MRI takes significant time for image processing and interpretation [12,13]. In addition, interand intra-observer variations are an additional drawback of breast MRI [14]. \n\nVarious commercially available computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for breast MRI have been introduced to address these limitations. CAD automates and speeds up image processing and analysis functions [10], and detects breast lesions by using an enhancement threshold. The system provides both morphologic and kinetic features of the breast lesion, and also provides quantitative information, such as, lesion dimensions and maximum tumor volumes. Levrini et al. [15] reported that CAD is just as accurate as breast MRI for size assessment of breast lesions.",

            "text": "][33][34][35] A multi-center clinical epidemiological study in western China reported that approximately 96.8% of hospitalized breast cancer patients underwent surgery. 32 The proportion of patients who underwent surgery in the present study was 86.84%, lower than in the previous study. This difference is primarily because the previous study only included one or two hospitals in each city, while the patients in our study may have undergone surgery in one hospital but were treated in several others. 32,36 The influence of age on the choice of treatment modes has been discussed by previous studies. \n\nOlder patients are more likely to undergo SM or BCS, and are less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 37 However, elderly patients are often insufficiently treated, which decreases their cancer-specific survival. 38 esearch of the prognosis of patients who underwent breast cancer surgery reported that the survival rate in patients aged > 70 years did not differ significantly from that of younger patients, indicating that surgical treatment should not be avoided for elderly patients because of their advanced age. 39 European Society for Medical Oncology clinical practice guidelines for primary breast cancer recommend that a treatment decision should not be determined solely by a patient's age. Other factors should be taken into consideration in conjunction with age. 40 ngoing debate over the choice of surgical modalities has fueled the development of BCT and mastectomy. Several prospective randomized clinical trials were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCT and confirmed that BCT and mastectomy had comparable effects on mortality, indicating that BCT was a safe treatment for primary early-stage breast cancer patients. 41 A long-term follow-up study reported no significant difference in contralateral breast cancer incidence between patients who underwent mastectomy or BCT. 16 Other research has argued that although the local-regional recurrence rate is similar between BCT and mastectomy in patients with early-stage breast cancer, in those with late-stage breast cancer, mastectomy can significantly lower the rate. 42 Furthermore, few differences in quality of life and symptom burden were observed between patients who underwent BCT and those who underwent mastectomy. 17,43 However, BCT may cause a higher risk of discomfort in the chest area and poorer sexual well being. 44",

            "text": "Recent advances in image-guided tissue sampling have enhanced diagnostic medicine, particularly in oncology. Traditional techniques, such as computed tomography (CT)-, ultrasound (US)-, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsies, remain the cornerstone of diagnostic interventions, each offering unique advantages based on tissue characteristics. CT-guided biopsies excel in deeper complex lesions, while US-guided biopsies provide real-time imaging ideal for superficial tissues. MRI-guided biopsies are invaluable for soft tissue evaluations. The emergence of fusion imaging, which combines modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or MRI/US, has demonstrated enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Despite these advantages, image co-registration and cost are the main drawbacks. Emerging techniques such as molecular breast imaging (MBI) and shear wave elastography (SWE) have been evaluated, particularly for breast cancer; however, research suggests that US is likely to remain the most effective modality due to both its cost and ease of use. Innovations in biopsy navigation, including augmented reality, \u201chot needles,\u201d and robotic assistance, demonstrate promise in closing the gap between operator dependency and procedural consistency; however, further research is required. While liquid biopsies show promise in non-invasive early cancer detection, they are not yet ready to replace tissue biopsies. Collectively, these advancements indicate a future where image-guided tissue sampling is more targeted, less invasive, and diagnostically accurate, although cost and technology access remain challenges.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Canadian women and one in eight women are expected to develop breast cancer in their lifetime [1]. Improved survival has been observed with early detection and tailored treatment. Surgery is a critical first-line treatment for early-stage breast cancer. Before the 1980s, there was controversy over the surgical management of breast cancer between total mastectomy (TM) or breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Landmark randomised control clinical trials established the safety of BCS for treatment of Stage I or II breast cancer, finding that BCS plus radiation had equivalent survival compared to TM [2,3]. These findings led to BCS plus radiation being recommended for early-stage breast cancer, assuming that clear margins and an acceptable cosmetic outcome could be obtained [4]. Hence, BCS presents an opportunity to de-escalate surgical treatment. \n\nDespite multiple randomised studies showing the safety of BCS and more recent observational studies [5] suggesting improved outcomes over mastectomy, the rates of mastectomy are still high. In fact, mastectomy rates are increasing and there is even a trend towards requesting contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPM) [6][7][8][9]. The literature has identified many factors in the patient decision-making process that leads patients to choose more radical surgery, including the perception of survival advantage, fear of recurrence, and desire to avoid radiation or distance to radiation centres [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Some patients also prefer CPM in order to achieve symmetry or better reconstruction results [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Many of these fears and factors can be addressed by patient education and strong therapeutic relationships.",

            "text": "It has been observed that increased BMI may be a detrimental factor for the outcome of patients with breast cancer [12]. In a large cohort study, a total of 2148 patients, including 592 premenopausal and 1556 postmenopausal individuals, were divided into subgroups based on BMI distribution. A higher BMI was significantly associated with larger tumor sizes in both premenopausal (p = 0.01) and postmenopausal women (p < 0.001) [13]. In another study, 636 women were tracked for a median period of more than 13 years. The authors found that higher BMI generally indicates a quicker recurrence of the disease and reduced survival rates. However, this relationship appeared to be more pronounced among younger women, those with progesterone receptor-negative disease, and those with a higher number of affected lymph nodes [12]. Interestingly, a meta-analysis gathered data from 12 prospective cohort studies involving 22,728,674 participants and its findings suggested a slight positive association-indicating a 2% rise in breast cancer risk with every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI. Surprisingly, for premenopausal women, a higher BMI seemed to lower breast cancer risk [14]. \n\nEarly-stage breast cancer, confined to the breast or spread to nearby lymph nodes, is considered treatable with a success rate of 70-80%, thanks to advancements in treatment options. In contrast, advanced-stage breast cancer is not curable, but treatment aims to extend survival, manage symptoms, and enhance quality of life. Accurate staging of breast cancer is essential for guiding treatment decisions and clinical management [15]. Imaging is crucial in assessing patients with breast cancer. These individuals typically undergo various imaging examinations-like Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computed Tomography, lymphoscintigraphy to locate the sentinel lymph node, bone scans, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) tailored to their cancer type and risk level. Additionally, the cancer's attributes and clinical factors guide the selection of the most suitable treatment for these specific groups of patients [16].",

            "text": "Although <5% of breast cancer diagnosed in mammographically screened population are stage III tumors [18], the reality is different from that in LMCs. With inadequate resources for early detection of breast cancer, the majority of patients from LMCs presents with advanced or metastatic disease. In a recent study done in Pakistan, the clinical presentation of patients was highest in advanced stages III and IV amounting to 65.7% in poor societies and 43.6% in middle-and high-income societies [11]. Both of these values are significantly higher than the 18.9% and 11.3% incidence of stage III and IV among African-Americans and American Whites, respectively, [18]. In another study in Nigeria, 72% of patients presented with stage III or IV disease [5]. In Arab countries, the data also show similar trends with a rate of advanced or metastatic stage reaching 60 to 80% of cases [1]. In Egypt, stages III and IV constitute 68% of all breast cancer cases [1,19,20]. As for Saudi Arabia, stages III and IV constitute about 46% of cases [21]. Also in Oman the rates are high amounting to 50.8% [22]. Efforts aimed at early detection can decrease stage at diagnosis and potentially improve the probability of survival and cure. \n\nHistologic diagnosis is necessary before initiating treatment. Choosing the type of biopsy whether fine needle aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy depends on the resources available. Again the BHGI has defined the basic level of diagnosis and pathology to include history, CBE, physical exam, and interpreting specimens from surgical biopsy and fine needle aspiration to include tumor size, lymph node status, histologic type, and tumor grade. The limited level includes mammographic or ultrasound imaging of the breast. Core needle biopsy and image-guided sampling are used in order to determine estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status as well as margin status. Also, within this level, resources should be allocated to include evaluation for metastasis with chest X-rays, ultrasound of liver, as well as blood studies.",

            "text": "The mammography recall rate was 9% (10/112) and the MRI Of the 37 actionable imaging findings, 15/37 (41%) findings were further evaluated by percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy. There were 10 actionable imaging findings recalled by mammography: one distortion, one mass lesion, four calcifications, three asymmetries and one other. Breast MRI showed 27 actionable imaging findings: eight mass lesions, eight non-mass enhancements, two focus and nine other. The mammography recall rate was 9% (10/112) and the MRI recall rate was 25% (27/108) (Table 1). Table 1 lists the prevalence of the actionable findings distributed by imaging modality. A total of 12 women underwent a percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy of 15 actionable imaging findings (three patients had more than one needle biopsy) and seven women underwent surgical treatment. 63% of biopsies were guided by ultrasound and the remaining 38% were equally distributed among either MRI or stereotactic (mammographic) guidance. In total, four women received a pathologic diagnosis of a breast cancer on both needle biopsy and surgical pathology. The other three patients undergoing surgery had high-risk lesions and one benign papillary lesion. All four cancers were detected by breast MRI in the initial screening round (prevalence screening, 61 examinations). One cancer was also concomitantly depicted by mammography, presenting as mammographic distortion. Pathology results showed one microinvasive and three high/intermediate nuclear grade invasive ductal carcinomas; all were HER2 negative cancers. Benign findings in the remaining percutaneous biopsies were fibrocystic changes, normal parenchymal lesions (i.e., fibromas of the overlying skin), ductal epithelial hyperplasia, benign sebaceous/epidermal cysts, benign papillary lesions, benign intramammary lymph nodes, fibroadenomas, fibrocystic adenosis, or benign epithelial proliferative changes.",

            "text": "The incidence of breast cancer is increasing worldwide. The risk of developing breast cancer can be up to 15%, depending on the country [1]. Current treatment options are more simple and better tolerated if the cancers are detected at an early stage. In addition, cancers that are detected early have a better disease-free survival and overall survival than advanced staged cancers [2\u2022]. Screening for breast cancer is important to allow early detection of cancer before the cancer is clinically found. Screening modality for breast cancer is mainly mammography worldwide. Some Asian countries prefer breast ultrasound as the primary screening tool due to the relatively small and dense breasts of women in these countries. \n\nThe mammographic screening programs have been highly successful in reducing breast cancer-related mortality, with reported breast cancer-related mortality reductions of up to 58% for women who actually received screening mammography [3]. Nevertheless, mammography still fails to detect breast cancers at an early stage in up to 30% of women, who eventually develop distant metastasis and may die from the disease. Mammography functions especially poor in women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer, with a reported sensitivity below 50% [4,5]. After the discovery of contrast-enhanced breast MRI in the mid-eighties [6,7], it was soon recognized that breast MRI had a considerable advantage over mammography for early breast cancer detection with its higher sensitivity. Studies focusing on screening for breast cancer in women with high risk revealed that there is higher incidence of breast cancer in these high-risk women, and as a result, fewer patients are needed to be enrolled in these trials in order to yield significant results. The results of these initial breast MRI screening trials in different countries were unequivocal, despite the variation in patient populations; the sensitivity of breast MRI is roughly double that of mammography [4][5][8][9][10]. In addition, breast MRI triples the additional yield of breast US as a supplementary screening test for women at increased risk [11].",

Breast cancer is life-threatening disease in females and the leading cause of mortality among women population. For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer has guided to astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in further proficient treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer is considered as one of the leading cause of death in post menopausal women accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it is diagnosed in their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding the self inspection and clinical examination of the breast. This review addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, pathogenesis of breast cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary therapies, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy etc for breast cancer.",

            "text": "Breast cancer continues to be the primary cause of mortality among women globally. Despite a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality rates in recent years due to increased awareness of early diagnosis and the application of hormone therapy, the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis still dramatically decreases the five-year survival rate for patients. Therefore, achieving early and accurate diagnosis, as well as complete removal of breast cancer, is crucial [17,18]. \n\nNumerous studies have underscored the efficiency of conventional imaging techniques for breast cancer diagnosis, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) [19][20][21]. Nevertheless, integrating these imaging modalities into operating rooms faces great challenges, and notably, they lack the capability to offer real-time feedback to surgeons reliably [22]. Despite the utilization of intraoperative ultrasound for certain cancer surgeries, depending on a single imaging modality often proves inadequate for distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous regions [23]. NIR-II imaging, as an emerging optical imaging modality in recent years, can afford excellent sensitivity, resolution, and real-time capability to visualize cancer lesions intraoperatively. In comparison to the visible and NIR-I regions, NIR-II imaging exhibits smaller tissue absorption and scattering and lower biological autofluorescence, resulting in a higher signal-to-background ratio and superior resolution [24][25][26][27]. \n\nSince 2020, NIR-II image-guided surgery has been applied in clinics; the impressive outperformance strongly facilitates the research and application of NIR-II intraoperative imaging [28,29]. Although ICG offers a convenient approach to perform NIR-II imaging in various cancers, such as breast cancer, gynecological cancer [30][31][32][33], and digestive tract cancer [34], the unstable tumor retention might affect surgeons to accurately locate and resect tumors [33,35]. In order to address the diverse and multi-level clinical demands, taking into account the advantages of NIR-II imaging, the development of novel NIR-II optical probes for in vivo imaging represents an optimal choice.",

            "text": "Preoperative CTLG provides important information about the status of SLNs in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The relations among tumors, lymph-vessels, and SLNs can be assessed together with the surrounding anatomy. Guided by CTLG imaging findings, SLNB can easily be performed as a minimally invasive procedure. SLNB for breast carcinoma was introduced in the mid-1990s, and has already been performed on thousands of patients with breast carcinoma. Nevertheless, many unanswered questions remain (Schwartz et al., 2002). One of the problems to be solved is the lack of methods for identifying the full set of SLNs draining the primary tumor. As one possible solution to this problem, lymphangiography using an oilin-water emulsion of contrast medium has been employed to assess the stages of malignancies. However, several complications have hampered widespread adoption of this method (Sato et al., 2007;Tangoku et al., 2004). Another possibility is CTLG, which allows visualization of the anatomy and provides functional data about lymphatic flow after interstitial injection of commercially available and commonly used intravenous contrast agents designed to enhance CT images. This method is simple, inexpensive and safe, such that CTLG has been performed in various fields, including video-assisted breast surgery (Yamashita and Shimizu, 2008), as well as in breast cancer patients requiring neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Ue et al., 2007) and patients with gastrointestinal malignancies (Tangoku et al., 2007). CTLG is technically easy to perform and the data acquisition time is short (Ue et al., 2007). In addition, CTLG can be performed at any institution equipped with a multi-detector row CT scanner. \n\nIn women, breast surgery is often performed using a lateral skin incision on the lateral mammary fold. This lateral skin incision saves the integrity of the skin blood supply, allows for a complete breast gland removal, and has benefits in terms of body image for women as no scars are apparent in the frontal view. Axillary clearance and/or SLNB can be easily performed via such a lateral skin incision (Regolo et al., 2008).",

            "text": "For tumor larger than 2 cm (clinical T2-4 stage) with/without axillary metastasis, if the molecular subtype and AR expression could be identified before surgery, we can determine whether the patient is suitable for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and which scheme should be used. However, currently, we cannot obtain histologic information by routine imaging examinations including mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Breast biopsy is still the standard operation to acquire histologic characteristics of breast cancer. However, breast biopsy is an invasive surgical procedure and is inapplicable for some patients. Besides, the assessment of molecular subtype and AR expression from pre-treatment biopsy specimen cannot reflect the change of receptors expression during treatment. Thus, an alternative method that can accurately and non-invasively evaluate the expression of receptors in breast cancer is an urgent requirement, which would be helpful to guide clinical treatment. \n\nIn recent years, an increasing interest has been focused on identifying imaging surrogates and developing non-invasive diagnostic tools for cancer characterization (26). Due to rapid advancements in quantitative radiology methods such as radiomics, radiogenetics, and radioproteomics, tumor biology could be evaluated in a non-invasive and cost-effective way. Radiomics allows inference of tumoral molecular status from medical image-derived features, and it allows the study of the tumoral heterogeneity both spatially and over time (27,28). Multi-parametric MRI, including dynamic contrast-enhancement (DCE) images, diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and other MRI sequences, is a well-established imaging modality for diagnosis, preoperative staging, and surgical planning of breast cancer in current routine clinical practice. DCE imaging is considered the most sensitive modality for detecting breast cancer (29). Ruey-Feng Chang et al. reported that the degree of heterogeneity on breast DCE-MRI was associated with molecular receptor status (30). DWI and its derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map also served as a non-contrast MR screening method in lesion detection and distinguishing malignancy from benign tumor (31).",

We obtained the breast tissue sample for each lesion when these patients underwent US-guided CNB for pathologic diagnosis. The criteria for selection among these initial patients included: 20 years of age or older; having a breast lesion pathologically diagnosed as malignant by core biopsy; treated with NAC and underwent subsequent surgery; and not pregnant at the time of diagnosis. Finally, 37 patients with 37 locally advanced breast cancers (mean age 50.5 years; age range 30-67 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. \n\nFor each patient, one of four radiologists (with 6-13 years of experience) performed US-guided CNB using a 14-gauge dualaction semiautomatic core biopsy needle (Stericut with coaxial guide; TSK Laboratory, Tochigi, Japan). In patients with large and heterogeneous cancers, the homogeneously solid areas were targeted for biopsies. The mean number of tissue samples obtained by US-guided CNB was six (range 5-8) samples. All samples except for one core of each lesion were used for pathologic diagnosis and IHC analysis. For HR-MAS MRS, one CNB sample was placed in a cryogenic vial and immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after biopsy. CNB samples were stored at -162\u00b0C for one to five months prior to HR-MAS MRS. All 37 patients were diagnosed with locally advanced cancer based on the CNB result and imaging findings obtained from breast US, mammography, and MRI. They were treated with anthracycline-and/or taxane-based NAC, and subsequently underwent surgery.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy, accounting for 12.5% of new cases globally by 2020 [1,2]. The survival rate of breast cancer for at least five years after diagnosis varies among populations depending on the economic standing of nations; it is greater than 90% in high-income nations, 40-65% in middle-income nations, and less than 40% in low-income nations [2,3]. This difference is primarily attributable to the ability of high-income nations to detect breast cancer early [1]. Early detection expands treatment options and lowers the risk of breast-cancer-related deaths considerably. The primary imaging modalities for the early diagnosis of breast cancer include mammography and ultrasound [4]. \n\nPreviously, ultrasonography was considered helpful only for cyst diagnosis. However, it improves local preoperative staging, guided interventional diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors [5]. Mammography has a low sensitivity for thick breasts [6]. Women with dense parenchyma are far more likely to develop breast cancer [7]. Dense breast tissue can be examined using ultrasound [8]. Recent research has demonstrated that high-resolution ultrasonography increases the diagnosis of tiny tumors by three to four tumors per 1000 women without clinical or mammographic abnormalities [9]. Carcinomas observed on mammography and sonography have a similar stage distribution [10]. To overcome the limitations of mammography, ultrasound is frequently employed for curative diagnosis [11]. Ultrasound is noninvasive, widely available, easy to use, less expensive, and provides real-time imaging [12]. Moreover, ultrasound is safer and does not generate radiation [13]. More importantly, ultrasound helps detect tumors in women with dense breasts and detects and classifies breast lesions that cannot be interpreted adequately through mammography alone [14]. Doctors can use ultrasound to identify many clinically relevant regions such as benign cysts or normal tissues. Most women over the age of 30 years usually undergo ultrasonography along with mammography. For women under the age of 30, ultrasonography is sufficient to decide whether a biopsy is necessary in a particular area of the suspected breast. \n\nHowever, early breast ultrasound diagnosis has limitations [15].",

            "text": "We report on our initial clinical experience of MRI-guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) with daily adaptive treatment planning for patients receiving breast radiotherapy in the prone position with a MRI-Linac radiotherapy system. As far as we are aware, this is the first reported clinical experience of breast radiotherapy delivered using the PPI technique. \n\nIn early-stage breast cancer management, there is significant momentum towards de-escalating intensity of treatment. Local recurrence rates in early stage disease have decreased over time and are reported to be less than 5% over 10 years of follow up in recent clinical trials (5,14,15). Nevertheless, fear of recurrence after treatment and long-term toxicities associated with treatment remain primary issues in survivorship, and local and distal breast cancer recurrence risk remains a concern even 20 years after treatment for early stage breast cancer patients (16). \n\nDe-escalation in breast radiotherapy has emphasized treating smaller target volumes and prioritizing avoiding nearby heart and lungs. A current standard breast radiotherapy modality involves external beam partial breast radiotherapy with CT-based image guidance. Several large Phase 3 trials have demonstrated good efficacy and toxicity of external beam partial radiotherapy when compared with whole breast radiotherapy (5,15). In this report, we present our initial patient experience of precision prone irradiation (PPI) with MRI-guided prone breast adaptive breast radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer treatment. Our preliminary comparative results indicate that there may be a potential to decrease CTV and PTV volumes based on MRI guided planning. \n\nImage-guided radiotherapy technologies are improving in sophistication and versatility to enhance the ability to target the at-risk regions and avoid healthy tissues during radiation treatments. The capability of on-table MRI guidance, adaptive planning, and delivery with the prone technique has several particular promise advantages to expand the therapeutic index of breast radiotherapy. \n\nFirst, MRI enables the ability to delineate soft tissue and surgical cavities to a great resolution than CT-based imaging. This superior visualization by MRI guidance can allow more accurate surgical  A representative surgical cavity target volume seen from an MRI image acquired on-table on the day of radiation treatment.

            "text": "In the present study, NAT was chosen by the multidisciplinary team to downstage the cancer depending on the biological subtype, with the aim of providing less invasive surgery, reducing postoperative complications, and improving cosmetic outcomes. The expanded use and improved efficacy of NAT for the management of triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer have led to increasing numbers of patients with no detectable residual disease at the time of surgery 38 . In such patients, a pCR is associated with a low risk of locoregional recurrence and better overall survival 8,9,22,38,39 . It was shown here that ultrasound-guided VABB, used in concert with other imaging modalities, can reliably identify a pCR in patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. Values in parentheses are 95% exact confidence intervals. The analysis included 50 patients: 22 with an imaging complete response (2 with residual disease at vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) and 20 with a complete response at VABB included in primary analysis) and 28 with residual disease at postneoadjuvant therapy imaging. *Three patients had missing information on MRI. \u2020Five patients had missing information on PET. \n\nIn recent decades, the widespread adoption of NAT has facilitated increased use of breast-conserving surgery, instead of mastectomy, with equivalent survival outcomes. Although breast-conserving surgery is a procedure with relatively low morbidity, it still affects quality of life. Approximately 30 per cent of patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery and SLN biopsy report moderate, persistent pain 2 years after surgery, and patients who have breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy report similarly lower quality of life up to 8 years after surgery 38 . \n\nIn 2017, the St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference highlighted opportunities for de-escalation of breast cancer treatment on the basis of tumour stage and tumour biology 40 . The omission of surgery should be restricted to patients for whom no residual disease after NAT can be expected. Therefore, patients who have a high probability of a pCR, and for whom there is evidence of concordance between iCR and pCR, are appropriate candidates for trials that omit surgery.",

Patients were included in this study if they were: (1) diagnosed with unifocal or multifocal invasive breast cancer or DCIS, (2) had tumors that were preoperatively US-visible, and (3) the tumors were non-palpable or deemed not clearly palpable by experienced breast surgeons and therefore required intraoperative radiological breast specimen assessment. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Some of the patients were included in a previous report that evaluated the accuracy of different specimen radiography techniques. 7 ll patients were evaluated preoperatively with a minimum of a two-view mammogram and bilateral breast US. Any suspicious lesions were evaluated using additional lateral and spot-compression views and/or tomosynthesis as needed. All mammograms were re-evaluated upon referral by an experienced senior breast radiologist, and further workup was performed if deemed necessary. Breast magnetic resonance imaging was performed according to national guidelines that are in concordance with the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists' recommendations. Patients underwent US-guided core biopsy or stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy and were diagnosed with breast cancer or DCIS. In cases with lesions in both breasts, each specimen was evaluated separately. \n\nThe mammographic features blindly evaluated by one of the two experienced breast radiologists with 15 and 30 years of experience, according to the fifth edition of the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) lexicon in a retrospective setting. 8",

However, the literature so far is ambiguous and the topic remains controversial. 34 The two predominant end points considered are reoperation rates and disease-free survival. 12 Several earlier studies, the comparative effectiveness of MRI in breast cancer (COMICE) 35 and the preoperative MRI for early-stage breast cancer (MONET) 36 trials, showed no improvement in either. More recent literature 37,38 confirms better reoperation rates in patients who had preoperative MRI, which is better at tumour demarcation, identification of satellite lesions and intra-ductal extension, resulting in fewer positive margins post primary surgery.\n\nThe Multicentre International Prospective Meta-Analysis (MIPA) 39 trial is evaluating the role of pre-operative MRI and is showing positive results in terms of surgical benefit with minimal increase in mastectomy rate.\n\nIt is important to realise that certain cancer subgroups benefit more from pre-treatment MRI. The general principle is that higher grade, worse prognosis (histological type and molecular subtype) cancers in younger patients with dense tissue, are most likely to benefit from pre-operative MRI (see Table 2).\n\nThe breast cancer subgroups in which pre-treatment MRI has been shown to be particularly beneficial are:\n\n\u2022 invasive lobular carcinoma 40  Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be the most sensitive modality for demonstrating the presence and extent of DCIS. 6,45 This, however, must be",

            "text": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with 890,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths as of 2018. 1 The five-year relative survival rate for head and neck tumors ranged from 53% in 1970 to 67% in 2010. 2 The survival rate for the early stages of the disease is 80%, but only 20% to 60% for the late stages. 3The survival rates have not improved significantly over the years due to various shortcomings.First, because of the insidious location of head and neck cancer, most patients are already in the progressive stage (tumor, node, and metastasis stage III-IV) at the initial diagnosis.Second, because of the deep anatomical location of the onset and infiltrating tissues of the lesion connecting the blood vessels and nerves, complete surgical resection (R0 resection) is difficult.Therefore, early diagnosis and improved surgical precision for resection are required to reduce recurrence and improve patient prognosis.\n\nIn early-stage patients, the lesions are usually limited; hence, surgical resection can be performed.In contrast, for patients with advanced disease, the treatment includes radiation and systemic therapy, followed by chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and simultaneous radiotherapy.The goal of surgery is to achieve complete resection with histological verification of the tumor-free margin; a negative margin is defined as >5 mm from the tumor margin. 4The gold standard at this stage is intraoperative frozen sectioning and postoperative determination of isolated specimens, but there are corresponding disadvantages; frozen sectioning is time-consuming and costly.Visual recognition and palpation to determine intraoperative borders have large errors.In addition, extensive excision can lead to physiological dysfunction.\n\nDespite rapid advances in tumor imaging with X-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, there are still practical difficulties in intraoperative imaging.Because of these limitations, new techniques are needed to monitor surgical margins in real time.Molecular imaging, first named by Weissleder in 1999, provides real-time visualization of tumors during intraoperative imaging-guided surgery. 5",

            "text": "Breast cancer is a very common cancer in women. Breast cancer is a malignant tumor occurring in females, especially in developed countries. The incidence of breast cancer has been rapidly increasing and was the second most common cancer after thyroid cancer in Korea in 2006. The remarkable aspect of breast cancer in Korean females, however, is that the mean age of affected females is very young, 45-46 years of age, which is approximately 15 years younger than women in Western countries; and 25% of Korean females are < 40 years of age compared to 5% of Caucasian women with breast cancer [1]. Currently, because screening examinations benefit patients with breast cancer in the early stages, surgery focuses on removal of the breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery, which aims to retain the shape of breast, is preferable to a complete mastec-tomy. Patients undergo radiotherapy in an effort to prevent local recurrence of cancer after breast-conserving surgery [2]. \n\nThe development of radiotherapy devices and techniques has resulted in radiotherapy as an important tool for curing breast cancer. The optimal radiotherapy plans must be designed to irradiate the cancer with a sufficient dose because of different locations and sizes of breast cancers. Geometric changes caused by organ motion during radiotherapy interfere with delivering a sufficient dose of radiation to the tumor and raise the risk of unnecessary radiation to normal organs. To reduce errors in radiotherapy, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) are utilized to determine the exact locations of tumors and adjacent organs and to establish treatment plans. Image fusion technology has also been developed; image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), which considers the breathing patterns of the patient, is currently most commonly used [3]. For cases of breast cancer, breathing control is part of radiotherapy planning, but the tangential technique is generally used for patients with breast cancer. Patients with left-sided breast cancers, which lie on the left lung and heart, could lead to complications, such as pneumonitis or heart disease, after radiother-Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer using a photon tangential field incurs a risk of late heart and lung toxicity.",

            "text": "[4,6,8,38,39]. In this study, real-time visualization of malignant lesions using fluorescence imaging during surgery led to the detection of 16% additional malignant lesions. This may improve cytoreduction and hereby patient outcome. The effect of the addition of intraoperative fluorescence imaging on survival was already shown by Stummer et al. in patients with brain glioma. They demonstrated that fluorescence imaging with 5-ala not only leads to more complete resections but also to improved progression free survival [5]. For ovarian cancer more prospective research is necessary to establish the effect on overall survival. When patients present with clinically early stage ovarian cancer, a staging procedure is recommended. During this procedure, biopsies of suspicious lesions are taken, supplemented with \"blind\" biopsies from predefined locations. Ultimate goal is to identify metastatic lesions whenever present in order to give adequate treatment i.e. systemic chemotherapy. Visualizing metastatic lesions by fluorescence imaging may optimize staging procedures, as less \"blind\" biopsies have to be taken. This could facilitate discrimination between true early stage ovarian cancer and more advanced stage with occult tumor spread. Especially in minimal-invasive surgery, when tactile information (palpation) of lesions cannot be obtained, fluorescence imaging could be of additional value. In breast cancer, up to 20% of patients have positive resection margins after resection of the primary tumor [3]. Visualizing tumor cells during surgery could lower the risk of an incomplete resection as identification of a positive margin can result in direct resection of residual tumor tissue. Although this will probably not influence overall survival, as patient with positive resection margins are currently treated with a re-resection or more intensive radiotherapy, significantly lower healthcare costs and burden to the patient could result. To investigate this concept, both FR\u03b1 positive breast cancer patients treated with BCS and breast ablation were included in the current feasibility study. However, for future applicability of fluorescence imaging in breast cancer surgery, the most added value is to be expected in BCS.",

Genuine invasive micropapillary carcinoma was defined as more than 90% of the tumor showing a micropapillary pattern. We excluded 6 patients who had not undergone preoperative MR imaging and one patient who had undergone pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Consequently, 14 patients were included in this study. Eleven patients presented with a palpable breast mass and three patients were detected by a screening exam. MR imaging was performed to evaluate the tumor extent after diagnosis of breast cancer by sonographically guided 14-gauge automated core needle biopsy in all of the patients. All patients were women with the mean age of 49 years (range, 37-67 years). Of this, 10 patients underwent breast conservation surgery and 4 patients underwent mastectomy. The time interval between the breast MR imaging and surgical resection was 1-17 days (mean: 6 days). The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and did not require informed patient consent for review of their images and records. \n\nStandard two-view mammography was performed using a Senographe 2000 D system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Complementary views such as spot compression magnification views were obtained when necessary. Each mammographic lesion was reviewed according to the lesion type (mass only, mass with microcalcifications, microcalcifications only, focal asymmetry, architectural distortion), mass characteristics (shape and margin), distribution and morphology of microcalcifications using the criteria given by the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) (6). mammography was available for review for 12 patients whereas sonographic results were available for review in all patients.

Conclusion: Radiographers demonstrate varying levels of agreement when evaluating image quality parameters. Agreement was better on parameters that were more objective. A large Phase III trial in which patients with multiple negative ultrasound guided tumour-bed biopsies after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with combined multi-targeted anti HER2-directed therapy in ERnegative patients are randomised to surgery plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone is required. The trial requires a Feasibility Study to explore both the willingness of patients to consent to randomisation and the accuracy with which multiple, post-treatment image-guided tumour-bed biopsies can detect residual disease. 1) To confirm concordance of local assessment of pathological complete response with central pathology review 2) To confirm that the multiple image-guided tumour-bed biopsies are able to exclude significant residual cancer burden 3) To explore the willingness of patients to be randomised Methods: Eligible patients will receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with dual targeted anti-HER2 therapy. All patients will undergo protocol specified tumour-bed biopsies to systematically sample the tumour site. Samples will be locally reported and submitted for central review. The willingness of those patients who have had a clinical response and negative post treatment image-guided tumour-bed biopsies to be randomised to either surgery and radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone will be explored via structured telephone interview prior to surgery.

The incidence of breast cancer in Asian and Thai women increased significantly each year (Bhothisuwan, 2004;Shin et al., 2010). Breast cancer is one clear example of excellent survival statistics when early-stage disease is treated using current therapies. Currently, numerous clinical methods are used in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The most effective screening technique at the present time is mammography. In fact, it is the only widely used imaging modality for breast cancer screening. Several large randomized clinical trials have shown that mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer (Shapiro et al., 1971;Thurfjell and Lindgren, 1996;Hendrick et al., 1997;Tabar et al., 2001). However, it is not yet a perfect technique.

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide as per the World Health Organization, 2022, and has a fairly favorable prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 90% as reported by American Cancer Society. As breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage in many women, the survival rate of patients receiving appropriate treatment is improving. For patients with breast cancer, quality of life, including body image after breast cancer surgery, is also becoming an important part of treatment and management. In recent years, treatment strategies for breast cancer, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have greatly improved. However, for operable breast cancer, surgical treatment, such as mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery, and breast reconstruction (BR) after mastectomy, is considered the most important treatments (1). In particular, radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery has proven to be the preferred therapy for early breast cancer because the survival rates are equivalent to mastectomy, and surgeons can safely maintain the natural breast shape after surgery (2). However, mastectomy is recommended in cases of inflammatory breast cancer, large tumors, multiple lesions, early pregnancy, or contraindication of radiation therapy (1). \n\nIn particular, it is difficult to perform breast conserving surgery (BCS) if the breast cancer is multicentric or contraindication of radiation treatment or persistently positive margins. In these cases, BR after mastectomy is considered instead of BCS. Moreover, studies have shown that BR after mastectomy helps improve esthetic outcomes and quality of life without compromising oncological safety, and the demand for therapeutic mastectomy followed by reconstruction is increasing (3,4). In addition, as an important part of current breast cancer treatment, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is widely used early-stage breast cancer, as well as locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer. If breast-conserving surgery is not possible after NACT, breast cancer patients undergo mastectomy as a surgical treatment. In this case, BR after mastectomy may be an important alternative surgical option (3).",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common form of noncutaneous cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths [10]. A personalized approach to breast cancer is important as breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease where management is dependent on multiple patient-specific factors [11]. Surgical management usually includes either breast conservation surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. Although mastectomy is an important and definitive treatment option for some patients, it is often associated with substantial psychological, social, and sexual sequelae, as well as significant body image distortion [12]. BCS followed by radiation therapy has been validated as an equivalent alternative to mastectomy, with similar survival rates, acceptable rates of local recurrence, and better cosmetic outcomes [13][14][15]. Approximately 60-75% of American women with early stage breast cancer are treated with BCS [16]. Traditionally, patients with inadequate tumor size to breast size ratios were managed with mastectomy, however recent advances in oncoplastic techniques allow more patients with extensive disease to be considered for BCS [17].\n\nA successful BCS requires multidisciplinary communication and planning between the surgeon, radiologist, pathologist, radiation and medical oncologist. The goal is to safely remove the tumor with adequate surgical margins and provide good cosmetic outcome without compromising survival. In patients undergoing BCS, negative margin status greatly reduces risk of local recurrence and increases relapse-free survival. Wire needle localization and non-wire localization such as seeds are accepted standards methods used to guide intraoperative surgical excision of nonpalpable breast lesions. However, determination of tumor size and extent remains imprecise regardless of the method utilized for BCS [18]. This results in positive margins requiring re-excision 22-34% of the time [18][19][20]. In addition to causing patient anxiety and extra health care expenses, re-excision for positive margins impairs cosmetic outcomes and increases the potential for complications from surgery [21,22]. Furthermore, localization techniques such as wires and seeds require the surgeon to estimate the 3D location and extent of cancer typically from 2D post localization mammography images, which are limited by their acquisition plane or display format. Furthermore, wires may",

The standard workflow to assess suspicious lesions is based on mammography, US, and when necessaryimage-guided needle biopsy. Criteria were developed for decision making about biopsy of US-detected masses [21,53,54]. When a suspicious lesion is identifiable on US, US is the preferred image guidance technique for percutaneous needle biopsy [55,56]. In fact, the procedure is fast, has low costs, allows for the use of smaller needles, is only minimally uncomfortable for the patient and does not expose the patient to radiation. US-guided breast biopsies offer great advantages over mammography or MRI guidance methods for needle biopsy. US-guided interventions can be requested not only by radiologists but also by referring physicians to established histopathologic diagnosis and allow treatment planning. Open surgical diagnostic biopsies are performed only in a few particular cases, either when image-guided biopsy is not possible or due to patient's preference. Independent of whether a mass is palpable or not, US guidance allows the operator to follow the procedure in real time and to verify the needle position for improving the overall accuracy. The patient position during biopsy is quite similar to the US examination. Breast compression is not required. The skin is disinfected and local anaesthesia is injected. A small incision of the skin is sometimes made at the entry site for an easier needle passage. The current good practice is the use of a 14-gauge or larger needle (which means using needles identified with smaller gauge numbers) to obtain three to six samples [50,51]. Markers visible at various imaging modalities may be positioned at the biopsy site under US guidance, especially when there is a chance of masking or the disappearance of the biopsied lesion due to bleeding or very small size. This final step allows the evaluation of the concordance of the biopsy position as compared with other imaging modalities and, in case of neo-adjuvant therapy (i.e. a systemic medical treatment adopted in the case of large tumours to be reduced before surgery), to have the tumour position marked also in the case of complete response to therapy.\n\nUS-guided needle biopsy is a",

            "text": "Surgeons may now conduct complex surgeries with more precision, accuracy, and safety thanks to image-guided navigation. This article analyzes how image-guided navigation devices have changed surgical operations. Surgeons now approach procedures differently thanks to the integration of imaging modalities like Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ultrasound with surgical navigation systems. Surgeons can confidently navigate complex anatomical features and plan surgical paths using these technologies' real-time, three-dimensional anatomy visualization. Image-guided navigation has advanced with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Augmented Reality (AR) devices improve spatial awareness and reduce errors by superimposing patient-specific anatomical data onto the surgeon's field of view. VR allows surgeons to perform complex surgeries in a virtual environment, increasing their skills and aiding preoperative planning. Another innovation is machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in image-guided navigation systems. These algorithms evaluate massive volumes of patient data, including medical pictures, surgery plans, and results, to help surgeons make predictions and judgments. Data-driven algorithms in AI-driven navigation systems optimize surgical operations, accuracy, and patient outcomes. Miniaturized and wireless tracking systems provide less invasive image-guided navigation. Electromagnetic and optical monitoring devices allow surgeons to track surgical tools inside the patient's body, providing real-time feedback and instruction. Image-guided navigation is being used in laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic-assisted surgeries. Image-guided navigation still faces challenges. The incorporation of diverse imaging modalities, system accuracy, and smooth compatibility with surgical instruments are ongoing research and development. To promote widespread adoption of these technologies, cost-effectiveness, training, and regulations must be addressed. Image-guided navigation has improved surgical visualization, navigation, and decision-making. Augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and tiny tracking have improved surgery and patient outcomes. Image-guided navigation could become common surgery with continued study and improvement in this sector.",

            "text": "In recent decades, with the widespread use of mammography for screening, the incidence of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has dramatically increased, and DCIS currently accounts for approximately 20% of all new breast cancer diagnoses [1]. Breast-conserving surgery combined with adjuvant radiotherapy is the standard treatment for small DCIS. The goal of breast-conserving surgery is to completely remove the tumor with clear margins while preserving normal tissue as much as possible for optimal cosmesis. However, most DCIS lesions are clinically impalpable, and they frequently involve a larger area than the extent visible on preoperative imaging. These features make it difficult to accurately localize the exact tumor extent before surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than mammography or ultrasonography in detecting DCIS [2,3], and lesions are often not detectable using imaging modalities other than MRI. However, conventional localization methods, such as hook wire or radioactive seeding techniques, are generally performed under ultrasonographic or mammography guidance and are rarely performed with MRI guidance in current clinical practice [4,5]. \n\nUnder such circumstances, an MRI-based patient-specific surgical guide for localizing the tumor extent using 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology can be an effective alternative. Here, we report the application of an MRI-based 3D-printed breast surgical guide (BSG) for breast-conserving surgery in patients with biopsy-proven invasive cancer concurrent with DCIS lesions not detected using preoperative ultrasonography.",

            "text": "Background This pilot prospective study aimed to evaluate ultrasound-guided cryoablation of breast cancer (BC) by assessing: (i) technical efficacy as the presence of necrosis in surgical specimens and rate of complete tumor ablation; (ii) safety as incidence and severity of complications; and (iii) patients\u2019 satisfaction using a dedicated questionnaire. In addition, (iv) we tested the capability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) to predict cryoablation efficacy. Methods From 07/2022 to 01/2023, we enrolled 20 patients with early-stage BC scheduled for breast surgery. Ten of them, with a cryo-feasible cancer location, were sent to cryoablation (cryo-group) and ten to routine surgical practice (control group). Both groups underwent surgery and were asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire. Results Of eleven patients screened for cryoablation, only one refused to be treated at another hospital (acceptance rate 10/11, 91%). Surgery was quadrantectomy in 19 cases and mastectomy in 1. In the cryo-group, the procedure was completed and steatonecrosis was observed in 10/10 cases, with complete tumor ablation in nine of them. The post-procedural status was evaluated with MRI in five patients, with CEM in four patients, and with ultrasound in one patient who refused MRI and CEM. MRI or CEM correctly predicted complete cryoablation in eight patients and incomplete cryoablation in one patient. Patients in both groups did not have serious complications and responded positively to satisfaction questionnaires. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided cryoablation of early-stage BC is well accepted by patients, effective, and safe. MRI and CEM were able to predict the procedure's technical efficacy. Trial registration https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05727813 updated February 14, 2023. Relevance statement Our pilot study showed that ultrasound-guided cryoablation is a promising nonsurgical alternative for treating early-stage BC. Key Points Ultrasound-guided cryoablation was effective and safe in early BC patients. The procedure was well-tolerated, with low morbidity and high patient satisfaction. MRI and CEM predicted cryoablation efficacy",

Breast cancer treatment methods vary based on the stage of the disease, its size, location, whether it has spread to other organs of the body, and the individual's physical state. Targeted treatments, hormone treatment, radiation therapy, and surgery are being used to treat breast cancer. \n\n1. Surgery This is the most common treatment option for people with breast cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body, and it's also a viable option for those with more advanced stages of the disease. The amount of tissue removed with the cancer varies according on the cancer's features, whether it has spread, and the patient's particular emotions. The following are a handful of the most common types of surgery: a. Lumpectomy (breast conserving surgery) According to the American Cancer Society [33], a lumpectomy, also known as a selective mastectomy, is a practice that requires removing the portion of the breast that contains the malignant tumour, as well as some healthy tissues and lymph nodes around it, while leaving the rest of the breast preserved as much as possible. This operation is often performed on women in the early stages of cancer, but in addition to the surgery, the patient will need additional treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone replacement therapy. Most surgeons and patients, particularly if the woman is going to lose her breast, prefer a lumpectomy over a full breast removal at first. Tenderness, transient inflammation, sclerosis, and a change in the look of the breast are all possible side effects of a lumpectomy.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is a highly common kind of cancer in women globally, requiring effective and well-tolerated treatments. Surgical resection continues to be a fundamental aspect of the treatment approach, particularly for breast cancer in its early stages [1,2]. Conventional surgical methods, including modified radical mastectomy (MRM), effectively remove tumors but can lead to unsatisfactory cosmetic results, such as prominent and noticeable incisions and changes to the natural contour of the breast. As breast cancer mostly impacts women, there is a growing emphasis on the psychological and aesthetic consequences after surgery [3]. The pursuit of ideal therapeutic results has now started to include not only the requirement for cancer safety, specifically total removal of the tumor and minimal chance of it coming back locally or throughout the body, but also a visually pleasing outcome after the surgery. This combined requirement has resulted in the emergence and increasing prevalence of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) as a substitute for conventional mastectomy treatments. Research has confirmed that BCS provides comparable or even better rates of disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence compared to standard surgical procedures. Additionally, BCS preserves the important anatomical structures of the breast, particularly the nipple-areolar complex [4,5]. \n\nThe use of endoscopic procedures into minimally invasive surgery represents a notable shift in the field, driven by advancements in medical research. Endoscopic procedures, which were first widely used in other surgical fields, are now becoming more frequently used to treat earlystage breast cancer. This procedure provides the dual benefit of efficient cancer therapy, in line with conventional surgical methods, together with a visually superior outcome [6,7]. Endoscopic surgery allows for the removal of tumors and examination of lymph nodes using smaller incisions that are strategically placed in less noticeable areas, such as the axillary region. This approach satisfies patients' aesthetic concerns while ensuring complete tumor removal and the ability to perform lymph node biopsies or dissections [8]. \n\nDespite these developments, there are still uncertainties about the comparative effectiveness of endoscopic minimally invasive surgery (EMIS) compared to standard surgical procedures for treating early-stage breast cancer.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequent cancers in women [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) cites several variables that may contribute to BC development, including obesity, electromagnetic pollution, environmental pollution, smoking, alcohol intake, and breast implants [2]. In addition, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) occurs in approximately 30% of patients with breast malignancy at diagnosis [3]. \n\nHistological stratification represents the gold standard for the classification of BC, based primarily on the differentiation grade and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [4]. Several studies demonstrated a significant degree of inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity and distinct BC subtypes, each corresponding to a differentiation state of mammary cells, representing a convergence point between normal mammary gland biology and breast cancer biology. One of the major hypotheses is that breast tumors consist of a mixture of inter-converting breast cancer subtypes that may affect the patient outcome [5]. Nevertheless, grading remains an important prognostic factor for prognosis, with grade III being the more aggressive one [6]; it follows that it is helpful to divide the study samples according to the different grades to make the study population homogenous. \n\nAccording to clinical guidelines [7], neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), followed by surgery and adjuvant systemic and local treatment, represents the current preferred treatment strategy [3]. Indeed, it can be helpful in early-stage LABC patients to enable breast-conserving surgery (BCS), thus limiting the diffusion of micrometastases and testing potential drug resistance [2,8]. \n\nPositron emission tomography (PET), integrated with computed tomography (CT), is a multimodal examination providing volumetric distribution of positron-emitting radionuclides in the human body [9].",

Moreover, the rapid information produced in the literature on this topic might have caused some missing new relevant paper. However, the overall evaluation points out that indications for neoadjuvant systemic treatment have growth from inoperable locally advanced to early-stage breast cancer. MRI plays a pivotal role and with morphological and functional modalities is making headway in tumor size evaluation, in the staging and in response prediction. Radiomics and radiogenomics MRI applications in the setting of breast cancer NACT response prediction are continuously increasing. Tailored systemic therapy strategies allow considerations of treatment de-escalation in excellent responders and avoiding or at least postponing breast surgery in selected patients.",

            "text": "Breast cancer remains one of the major global health concerns, affecting millions of women worldwide annually. Significant advancements have been made in early diagnosis and treatment of early-stage breast cancer, leading to higher survival rates and improved quality of life for patients 1 . However, we still face the challenge of tumor recurrence, which can occur even after apparently successful treatment 2 . Understanding the factors associated with this recurrence, especially in patients with early-stage tumors, is essential for developing strategies to predict and rapidly identify recurrences, as well as modify intervenable risk factors. \n\nFactors associated with recurrence in operable breast cancer patients undergoing surgery as the sole treatment modality \n\nIn assessing breast cancer patients, certain factors may indicate a higher risk of recurrence. These factors are divided into those related to the patient, such as young age at diagnosis, premenopausal status, and obesity. Although some of these factors, like age and menopausal status, cannot be modified, obesity can be a focus of attention during treatment 3 . Other predictive factors for poor outcomes are related to tumor analysis, such as HER2 amplification, high Ki67 index, and the presence of angiolymphatic emboli. Subtype-related factors are also unmodifiable. Nevertheless, even these immutable factors provide important data for better patient monitoring 4 . \n\nWhen considering treatment for patients with early-stage breast tumors without metastases and low histological grades, the standard approach is surgery without the need for neoadjuvant therapy 5 . Depending on the surgical modality adopted and definitive biopsy results, adjuvant treatment may be recommended for these patients 6 . Patients with more advanced tumors require neoadjuvant therapy. Even patients with early-stage tumors undergoing the gold-standard treatment-surgery, with or without adjuvant therapy-have a risk of recurrence 2,7 . \n\nIn this context, this study explored the variables associated with recurrence in patients with early-stage breast tumors and the possible clinicopathological parameters related to this outcome.",

In order to operate on such small lesions, a preoperative localization is required, usually by ultrasound or mammography in case of suspicious microcalcifications. Conservative treatment for breast cancer is not only addressed in early stage cases but also for tumors that respond well to neoadjuvant therapy and have a less aggressive histopathological and immunohistochemical profile. The placement of radiopaque markers in the tumor bed when the biopsy is performed to guide the subsequent surgery is appropriate. In case of ptosis, oncoplastic surgery techniques, which can address both breasts to achieve, for example symmetrization, can produce a favorable postoperative outcome in terms of aesthetics, which may often matter for the patient's evolution. Currently, all aspects of the multimodal treatment of breast cancer are covered, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up, at the Bucharest Institute of Oncology.",

            "text": "Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important imaging modality for the diagnosis of breast cancer because of its high sensitivity of 68%-100% [1][2][3]. In patients with cancer, MRI is known to reveal additional cancers that are occult on mammography or ultrasonography (US) in a median of 16% of patients [1][2][3][4][5]. However, because of its relatively low specificity (range, 37% to 97%), MRI may increase unnecessary total mastectomy (TM) or wider excision, and false-positive lesions can increase patient anxiety [6][7][8][9][10]. Furthermore, no study has shown that MRI reduced the reoperation rates. A few studies suggested that even the additional lesions detected by MRI can be controlled by nonsurgical treatments, including radiation and systemic therapy [3,11,12]. Nonetheless, MRI is increasingly used to reduce the amount of residual disease detected during postoperative surveillance [3,10,13].\n\nMany studies have emphasized the need to obtain biopsies of all lesions, and therefore, the role of second-look ultrasonography (SLUS) for MRI-identified additional lesions (MRALs) has been highlighted [4,6,[14][15][16]. SLUS facilitates the detection of MRI-concordant lesions, provides morphological and vascular information, and helps predict the pathology of the lesions. SLUS is well-tolerated, cost-effective, and time-saving for patients and surgeons awaiting an urgent operation. However, limited data are available on the validation of these lesions after SLUS in a clinical setting in terms of the value and frequency of imaging-guided interventions. The goal of our study was to investigate suspected MRALs in breast cancer patients and to characterize the role of SLUS and imaging-guided interventions.",

            "text": "The images used in this study were retrieved from the Picture Archiving and Communication System digital archive, and the results of mammograms, US images, and MRI scans were re-evaluated. The findings were categorized by imaging method, as follows: microcalcifications, a mass/nodular opacity, or suspicious non-mass findings (i.e., architectural distortion and asymmetry) on a mammogram; a mass/nodular lesion or nonmass lesion (i.e., distortion or echogenicity changes) on a US examination; and a mass or non-mass contrast-enhancing lesion on an MRI scan. The patients without imaging findings were also noted. In each case, the lesion's largest diameter was recorded and categorized into two groups: under and above 15 mm. The final Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category on the imaging reports was also documented. \n\nOther data collected from the records included the needle biopsy type and biopsy sampling method. The imaging-guidance modality was chosen based on the findings and visibility of the lesion on imaging. Stereotactic guidance was usually preferred for microcalcifications, while US was used for lesions that were visible on the US. Stereotactically guided biopsies were performed in 182/1.343 (13.6%) patients on a prone table or an add-on unit using a 9 to 12 G directional vacuum-assisted needle. US-guided biopsies were performed in 1.161/1.343 (86.4%) patients with an automated tru-cut system using 14 to 16 G needles with a 2-cm cutting surface. The number of cores used was another analysis point, and this information was categorized as n <4 and n \u22654. \n\nThe final pathology reports of the patients who had surgical excision or were stable for at least one year of follow-up were documented. The follow-up period varied between 12 and 180 months (median: 30 months). In total, 929 patients underwent surgical excisional biopsy, and 414 were followed up with at six-month intervals. Recommendations for excision or surveillance were made in a multidisciplinary meeting.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, research on laryngeal cancer treatment has primarily focused on surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and cell morphology. These areas form the core research directions. Keyword analysis indicates a shift from basic morphological studies to more sophisticated topics such as disease prognosis, epidemiology, tumor recurrence monitoring, and clinical trials. \n\nLaryngeal cancer treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, with surgery being the preferred method for most cases [10,11]. Treatment options for early-stage lesions (T1 and T2, either supraglottic or glottic) generally involve radiation therapy, endoscopic laser therapy, and surgical resection. The five-year survival rates for T1 lesions are similar across treatment modalities [12]. However, T2 lesions show marginally lower survival rates with radiation therapy compared to surgery, with a difference of 10 %. For T3 and T4 lesions, radiotherapy alone is considerably less effective than surgical approaches, positioning surgery as the optimal strategy for managing advanced disease [13]. Clinicians strive to eliminate cancer, especially in advanced stages, while preserving  function and enhancing both survival and quality of life [14]. These goals are supported by advances in integrated treatment methods, including laser and surgery, induction chemotherapy, and both preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy, along with biological therapies. \n\nThe primary surgical procedures for laryngeal cancer include partial laryngectomy, total laryngectomy, and transoral minimally invasive surgeries, such as transoral laser surgery and transoral robotic surgery [15]. Clinical studies indicate that when surgical indications are precisely determined, postoperative recurrence rates show no significant difference between partial and total laryngectomy. Consequently, surgeries that preserve function are increasingly favored. The standard surgical approach is CO 2 laser surgical resection, designed to minimize the operation's extent and maintain bodily functions [16]. Introduced in the 1970s, the CO2 laser is especially effective for early-stage vocal fold laryngeal cancer. However, the efficacy of laser surgery and radiotherapy in managing early-stage cancer has led to significant modifications in partial laryngectomy techniques.",

Risk factors associated with positive margins are predominantly related to tumor biology factors or patient characteristics and, therefore, cannot be influenced directly to improve surgical outcome. Instead, multidisciplinary research should focus on techniques that provide the surgeon with a so-called ''theragnostic'' tool, enabling the surgeon to obtain an optimal balance between safe surgical margins and good cosmetic results. Current techniques present significant difficulties in this perspective. New innovative techniques, such as radioguided and NIRF optical imaging-guided surgery, are emerging.

            "text": "Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer types in women, with an estimated 1.67 million new cases in 2012. 14 It is essential to detect cancer at an early stage to optimize patient outcomes. Mammography is the primary imaging modality in screening programs, followed by ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used in women with an increased risk for breast cancer. Lesions that are not visible on mammogram or ultrasound may be detectable on MRI which has a higher sensitivity than the other two imaging modalities. 10 Computed tomography is not routinely used in breast cancer screening due to the additional radiation dose and the limited added value besides mammography. When a suspicious lesion is found and diagnosis needs to be confirmed the radiologist may decide to acquire a tissue sample through a biopsy. The next step in the evaluation of MRI detected suspicious lesions is targeted ultrasound imaging and, if positive, ultrasound guided biopsy. However, the radiologist is often not capable to find the detected lesions on MRI during ultrasound scanning. This makes an MRI-guided biopsy necessary. It is difficult to target the lesion precisely during this procedure due to bore accessibility constraints that require the patient to be moved in and out of the scanner multiple times. When a positioning grid is used, discretization errors up to 4 mm are introduced. 9 In addition, aspiration and other unintentional body movements may cause breast tissue displacements. These factors may cause false negative results, or a prolonged procedure due to repositioning of the needle. 3,15 An MR safe robotic system could solve the shortcomings of existing manual MRI-guided biopsy procedures. Such a system, when placed inside the scanner bore, allows biopsies to be performed with fast MRI feedback. We expect that due to the increased accuracy fewer samples will be needed, resulting in reduced tissue damage and shorter procedure times. In view of past developments on this topic the aim of the Stormram 4 project is to design and characterize a novel MR safe robotic system for breast biopsy with significant improvements over earlier designs, especially in terms of accuracy and workspace.",

Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of early stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant therapy [2,3]. The success of BCS, however, is reliant upon negative or clear margins, with positive margin status thought to be a primary indicator of local breast cancer recurrence [4]. BCS cases with positive margin status as determined by histopathology necessitate follow-up surgery. Standard of care BCS procedures result in positive margins in up to 35% of patients [5], leading to re-excision, where higher positive margin rates are seen at centers where larger normal tissue borders around tumor are required. Additionally, in many BCS patients with adequate tumor margins, negative margins are achieved at the expense of excessive resection of healthy breast tissue with lumpectomy volumes up to 2.5x greater than the necessary resection volume [6]. Not only does follow up surgery delay adjuvant therapy, but it also leads to increased patient stress giving way to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality rates [7][8][9][10][11]. The implementation of intraoperative margin detection methodologies based on pathology techniques including touch prep cytology [12] and frozen section analysis (FSA) [13] have been successful in reducing re-excision rates. However, these aforementioned procedures not only increase surgical time and are dependent upon the presence of a pathologist, but they have also been found to contain significant variation in their sensitivity and specificity between studies [14,15]. Consequently, the majority of US hospitals have not adopted these pathology based techniques for intraoperative margin assessment during BCS, thus warranting a modality that is able to decrease re-excision rates in a rapid platform within the operating room (OR) [16]. \n\nFluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is an optical imaging modality that has become an attractive tool for intraoperative margin assessment due to its real time imaging capabilities.",

            "text": "The additional benefit to the patients is that they are seen by the 3 primary cancer specialists on one day and do not have to make several trips to be reevaluated. Often patients are not aware that the management of BC may require treatments after surgery with radiation to the breast, hormonal therapy, and/ or chemotherapy. These basic concepts of management of early-stage BC can also be introduced to the patients during their first visit to the multiD clinic. \n\nThe following case demonstrates many interactions between disciplines that are vital to patient care. A 40-yearold woman, with no known risk factors for breast cancer, presented for a baseline mammogram. This mammogram showed dense breasts with bilateral scattered and grouped calcifications with an asymmetric distribution, more numerous in the upper outer quadrant (Figure 5). The test was interpreted as incomplete, requiring additional evaluation with dedicated magnification views. When the patient returned for the additional diagnostic work-up, the morphology of the left breast calcifications was found to be suspicious, while the right breast calcifications were categorized as probably benign (Figure 6). Of note was that the breast thickness under mammographic compression was only 2.5 cm, usually a limiting factor to performing a needle biopsy under stereotactic guidance. The radiologist informed the patient of the results and need for biopsy. The patient was referred to the multidisciplinary breast clinic for further evaluation and discussion of treatment options. \n\nHer case was presented to the multidisciplinary panel (breast imaging, breast surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and breast pathology). Based on the imaging findings, the options of stereotactic-guided core and excisional biopsy were discussed. The patient elected to undergo a stereotactic-guided approach with the pathology demonstrating extensive atypical ductal hyperplasia. The case was discussed again in the multidisciplinary conference. Due to the presence of extremely dense breast tissue, 15,16 an independent risk factor for breast cancer on mammogram, the patient's young age, and the newly diagnosed high-risk lesion, a breast MRI with gadolinium was recommended.",

We selected and examined 44 articles that had as subject the use of a specific imaging method in breast cancer management (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, ultrasound-guided biopsy, PET-CT). After analyzing their data, we summarized and concluded which are the best ways to use each one of the mentioned techniques for a good outcome.

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the second most lethal cancer (after lung cancer) among women in the United States. [1,2] Treatments for breast cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. [5] Effective factors in the selection of treatment modalities include tumors size, patient's age, menopausal status, estrogen or progesterone receptors, tumor marker, lymph node status, [6] and side effects of selected modalities. [7] The first treatment choice for patients is surgery (except in advanced diseases) [8] that can be carried out as modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. [9] In some cases, patients undergo radiotherapy following mastectomy (that is called postmastectomy radiotherapy [PMRT]) that include (1) patients with 4 or more metastatic axillary lymph nodes; (2) T3/T4 tumors with positive axillary nodes and patients with operable stage-3 tumors; and (3) positive margins or gross (>2 mm) extranodal extension. In addition, PMRT may be carried out for patients with some of the following features: (1) tumor is located in the central or inner quadrant and associated with positive axillary nodes; (2) lymphatic vascular space invasion; and (3) 1-3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes. [7] RT improves local control and survival in patients with high-risk breast malignancy. [10,11] reatment guidelines for PMRT in 2001 were published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These guidelines explained that the chest wall should be treated adequately. [12] The chest wall is the most common site of recurrence, and delivering enough radiation dose to the chest wall is very important in reducing the risk of treatment failure. [13] Determination of surface and superficial chest wall doses give valuable information to avoid near-surface recurrences and to limit severe early and late skin reactions. [14] roviding the adequate dose to the chest wall, while keeping radiation-induced side effects as low as possible, remains a challenge. [15,16]",

            "text": "Breast cancer ranks first among all female tumors, and it tends to be diagnosed at a younger age than other common cancers, with a great threat to women's health and safety [1]. The early diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer are of vital importance, especially for young women with the treatment of breast-conserving surgery (BCS, also known as partial mastectomy or lumpectomy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as an integral tool that is used in combination with mammography and Ivyspring International Publisher ultrasound, has a sensitivity ranging from 86% to 100% in the detection of breast lesions [2][3][4][5]. MRI remains the most powerful tool for detecting clinically suspected lesions which are mammographically and sonographically occult. However, the specificity of MRI is between 37% and 97% [6][7][8][9]. The lower and variable specificity is primarily due to considerable overlap in the appearance of benign and malignant lesions. Thus, breast MRI is often performed as a preoperative examination for suspected lesions that can't be seen with mammography and ultrasound to assess the disease extent. Moreover, MRI-guided localization and biopsy of suspicious lesions are often needed before the surgery, particularly for the young women who deserve to receive BCS. Besides, MRIguided intervention is a valid technique for the diagnosis of suspicious non-palpable lesions (NPLs) and small masses, which is easy to cause misdiagnosis and delay the treatment of the diseases. These MRIguided interventions, which are safe, accurate, and effective with a low complication rate that includes infection, hematoma information, and pneumothorax, have transformed the practice of breast imaging [10][11][12][13][14]. \n\nSince the 1990s, MRI has been used for breast cancer screening and staging. In 2010, the American College of Radiology (ACR) required facilities to have the equipment to have MRI-guided interventions or have an agreement with the referral center to do so. Successful MRI images analysis for breast tumors is a crucial component for breast surgery [2,15,16].",

In addition to prognostic information, it helps the physician in deciding between sentinel node biopsy, upfront axillar lymph node dissection, or neo-adjuvant treatment. Reported sensitivities and specificities for ultrasound vary between 26.4% and 92% with specificities of 55.6%-98.1%. 33 Suspicious lymph nodes at ultrasound should be confirmed by percutaneous procedures, either fine needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy.\n\nThe imaging modalities used for distant staging depends on tumor stage. The lungs, liver, and skeleton are the most frequently affected sites. Asymptomatic women with early-stage breast cancer are generally assessed by chest radiography -although its diagnostic value can be questioned -and liver ultrasound. Advanced imaging should be reserved for patients with symptoms suspicious for metastases, (node-positive) locally advanced breast cancer, and patients with an elevated tumor marker. In this setting, staging may be performed by chest CT combined with MRI with DWI sequence for assessment of the liver due to its high sensitivity of on average 87.1% for detecting liver metastases. 34 For detecting bone metastases, an MRI with T1-weighted sequence and DWI of at least the full-spine and pelvis is the preferred imaging modality. Bone scintigraphy is only recommended in the case of unavailability of or unequivocal findings at MRI, although its value during pregnancy is unclear. 11 When available, whole body diffusion-weighted",

Our study showed that more patients treated with quadrantectomy had progression of disease compared with those treated with mastectomy. The missing breast lesion in some patients treated with quadrantectomy might grow into a larger tumor, which belongs to higher T stage. Lastly, there was no systematical research or basis of evidence-based medicine to guide the operative range of quadrantectomy. Surgeons may decide the range according to their personal experience and patients' general conditions, which leads to unstable effects. \n\nOwing to lack of primary tumor, some studies reported that the prognosis of OBC was slightly better than breast cancer with a palpable lesion at the same stage. [11] So, breast radiotherapy was gradually popular in recent years for OBC. It was reported that there was no significant difference between mastectomy and breast radiotherapy in the local control and long-term survival rate. [8] However, there is a controversy about the choice of target area and dose for radiotherapy. [12] Then, the whole breast radiation therapy could possibly lead to breast deformation, which is contrary to the requirement of cosmetic effect. \n\nIn 1907, Halsted [13] first described a clinical phenomenon known as \"cancerous axillary glands with nondemonstrable cancer of the mamma.\" In this stage, breast cancer was mainly found by physical examination. OBC was also known as nonpalpable breast cancer. As early as 1950s, x-ray photography was used for the examination of breast diseases. [14] Subsequently, color Doppler ultrasonography was also popularized. The combination of them greatly improved the detection rate and diagnostic rate of breast lesions. Then OBC was definited as   breast cancer which could not be detected by these 2 conventional breast imaging and this definition has been used ever since. As more imaging technologies were continuously developed, such as MRI, PET-CT, breast scintigraphy (Tc-99m), the diagnosis of OBC entered the advanced breast imaging phase. Breast MRI has significantly improved our ability to identify OBCs that are not detected on mammography. [15,16]",

            "text": "Surgery is a major pillar for clinical management of cancer. About 80% of 15.2 million newlydiagnosed cancer patients in 2015 require surgery across the globe and by 2030 this figure will increase to 45 million [39]. Besides preventive, diagnostic, and cosmetic purposes, surgery contributes substantially to the cure of solid cancer at their infancy by removal of cancer tissue and lymph node. It has served as the only curative therapy for most solid tumours at an early stage, such as oesophagal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC), to mention only a few (Table 1). However, a majority of cancer cases were diagnosed at locally advanced or even metastatic stages, limiting the applicability of curative surgery. The development of oncological surgery mainly focuses on decreasing its invasiveness that, on a basis of equivalent anticancer efficacy, may help minimize perioperative complications and postoperative side-effects, and ultimately improve patients' quality of life. Laparoscopic surgery has shown equivalent anticancer efficacy and lower incidence or intensity of complications, compared with open surgery in gastric cancer and colorectal cancer [40,41]. However, critics indicate that high-quality evidence from well-designed randomized clinical trials with sound methods is needed to justify the routine implementation of laparoscopic gastrectomy [42]. Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery in pancreatic or periampullary cancer and cervical cancer was associated with an inferior oncologic outcome compared with open surgery [43][44][45][46]. Endoscopic surgery has been applied in early oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer in carefully selected patients in expert centres, such as T1a gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis [47][48][49][50]. Despite versatile flexibility of robotic surgery, its associated survival benefit and cost-effectiveness have been disputed, especially in mastectomy and other cancer-related surgeries Current major therapeutics for cancer. In the primary site, local treatments, including surgery, imaging-guided interventional procedure, and radiotherapy, can be applied with curative intent.",

The cancer entities differ with respect to the distribution of stage at diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.\n\nVoronoi treemaps (Fig. 4) Figure 5 presents an analysis of therapy sequences faceted by the four disease-specific sub-cohorts and stratified by UICC stage at diagnosis. The visualization illustrates the number of patients who received therapies (x-axis) from the first up to the sixth anti-cancer treatment (y-axis) including the flows of patients between the different modes of therapy. Surgery is the most frequent mode of therapy for early-stage cancer of the pancreas, larynx and kidney (UICC stage I and II). Higher clinical stages at diagnosis (UICC stage III and IV) were more frequently treated with other modalities, which differed among cancers. While systemic therapy dominated in patients with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer, radiation and systemic therapies prevailed in patients with laryngeal or kidney cancer. For cancer of the thyroid gland in early stage (UICC stage I and II), nuclear medicine treatment, such as radioactive iodine therapy, and in later stages, surgery and systemic therapy are most frequently documented. The decreasing size of the frequency bars in Fig. 5 indicate the successive relative reduction of patients receiving additional therapies. This observation holds for all disease-specific sub-cohorts and all strata. The flow of patients between therapies is indicated by the colored alluvial connections between the bars. These alluvial connections illustrate that for early stage (UICC stage I and II) malignancies the mode of the first therapy (e.g., surgery) is re-applied when successive therapy is required. For malignancies detected in later stages (UICC stage III and IV), however, the alluvial streams reflect multimodal anti-cancertreatment, more often moving from one mode of therapy to another (e.g., from surgery to radiotherapy in stage IV thyroid cancers).",

Management and treatment of breast cancer, depending on clinical staging, tumor biology, and molecular subtype, include surgery, local tissue-targeting radiotherapy, and systemic therapies such as chemo, hormonal, and targeted therapy. In early stages of cancer, the surgical management of breast cancer via lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) or mastectomy (surgical removal of breast tissues) with the removal of clear margins of both invasive and non-invasive cancer, is required. Systemic therapies may be required as post-surgical adjuvant therapy to enhance disease-free and overall survival, depending on the molecular subtyping and pathology determined by tumor and axillary nodal status. In the more advanced stages, systemic therapies are involved in disease control, palliative management, and improvement of overall survival. In terms of disease control, neo-adjuvant systemic therapy, which is the administration of therapeutic agents before a main treatment, is used in the reduction of tumor size and burden, hence impacting subsequent treatment, surgical options, and long-term outcomes [16][17][18]. Throughout the process of detection, diagnosis, management, and treatment of breast cancer, patients experience trauma and stress in physical, psychological, and emotional aspects. Hence, it is important to understand the holistic needs of breast cancer patients to better provide supportive care throughout their journey.",

            "text": "Carefully conducted randomized controlled trials have shown no significant difference in either overall survival or local recurrence for women who undergo mastectomy versus those who elect to have breast conservation surgery (BCT) followed by radiation therapy for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer [1]. Based on these findings, mastectomy rates had been declining over the past 3 decades in favor of BCT [2], but within the past several years both unilateral and bilateral mastectomy rates have begun to rise [3,4]. Several reasons for this observed increase have been proposed, including expanded screening for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations, advances in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, increased public awareness and heightened patient anxiety, and the more liberal use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are few data with which to evaluate the significance of these proposed etiologies. \n\nCurrently, breast MRI is often used in newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer to evaluate the extent of disease and look for additional foci of mammographically occult lesions in the affected breast, and to examine the contralateral breast. However, because MRI is a very sensitive test, the false-positive rate for detected lesions is high, leading to an increased number of image-guided biopsies before definitive surgery. Nonetheless, MRI does detect mammographically occult disease in the ipsilateral breast in 11 to 31%, of patients [5] and in the contralateral breast in 3 to 4% [6]. Although these lesions are usually relatively small when they are detected, surgical treatment planning can be affected. Based on the extent of disease and the location in the breast, patients may undergo wider lumpectomy or mastectomy; however, for the majority of patients in whom no additional lesions are found, management remains unchanged. Whether or not this increased rate of detection of small foci of disease will ultimately lead to improvements in the local recurrence rate and/or mortality rate remains to be determined. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize the increased use of preoperative breast MRI at our institution over a 6 year period, and to investigate whether patients who underwent a preoperative breast MRI were more likely to ultimately have a mastectomy than those who did not undergo MRI.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. General local-regional treatment strategies for early-stage breast cancer include partial or total mastectomy with surgical axillary staging, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy as indicated. Due to the results of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the local-regional benefit of adjuvant radiation following breast-conserving surgery in reducing local-regional recurrence following breast conservation, adjuvant radiation to the whole breast became the standard of care for early-stage breast cancer patients [1,2]. Hypofractionated whole-breast radiation has become a standard approach following more recent level 1 evidence of equivalent disease control and toxicity outcomes [3,4]. Shortened radiotherapy courses are more convenient for patients and less costly to the healthcare system [5][6][7][8]. \n\nFor select patients with favorable early-stage breast cancer, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has also become a reasonable option after breast-conserving surgery. Not only is the total radiation course shortened to 5-10 days of treatment, but there is the added benefit of reduced radiation exposure to the breast skin and tissue as well as underlying lungs and heart [9]. Over the past 20 years, phase II and III trials evaluating APBI have demonstrated promising local-regional control and cosmetic outcomes with numerous APBI modalities, including brachytherapy and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) [10][11][12][13][14]. For example, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) strategies using low-energy (50 kV) photons or electrons in a single-fraction treatment were evaluated as modalities in the TARGIT-A and the ELIOT trials [11,12]. Phase III non-inferiority trials have demonstrated acceptable short-term local-regional control outcomes with APBI, though notably their reported outcomes for APBI did not meet the non-inferiority threshold when compared to outcomes with whole-breast radiation [11]. Utilizing this data, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (AS-TRO) has created expert Consensus Guidelines to identify patients suitable for APBI, including low-energy photon IORT specifically [15].",

While excitement about the role of this modality in improving the planning of surgical treatment of breast cancer patients is increasing [1][2][3][4][5][6], many areas of uncertainty remain, especially related to the clinical importance of additional lesions that are detected by the use of MRI [7][8][9].

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common c\u00e2ncer among women worldwide, accounting for 16% of all female cancers. Its death rate was 13.22 / 100,000 women in 2017. Although this cancer is considered a disease in the developed world, the majority (69%) of deaths from this cause are registered in developing countries 1. In Brazil, breast cancer has a higher incidence in all regions. For the year 2020, 66,280 new cases were estimated, which represents an incidence rate of 43.74 cases per 100,000 women [1] . \n\nConservative surgery today is still considered the standard approach in early stage breast cancer, as it has a proven benefit in conjunction with radiotherapy, providing a survival rate similar to that of radical mastectomy, as long as there is adequate selection of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breasts is foregrounded in this scenario, as it has sensitivity above 90% and it is superior to conventional imaging methods in measuring the tumor and identifying additional lesions, allowing the identification of additional foci in 12.0-31 , 2% of patients in the ipsilateral breast and in 3-10% in the contralateral breast, modifying the treatment in up to one third of the patients with breast cancer [2] . \n\nIt is important to highlight that breast cancer, due to its particularities, cannot be analyzed in isolation as it presents different histological and molecular subtypes and has differences in image, prognosis and therapeutic response. It is important that studies evaluating breast MRI be individualized for each subtype, in order to define in which scenarios the imaging method performs best [4,5] . \n\nThe Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), developed by the American College of Radiology since 1992, is an important guide for the standardization of breast imaging exam reports (mammography, ultrasound and MRI) and for auditing services that use these methods. Its objective is to standardize the nomenclature of the reports, which aims at the diagnostic conclusion and at proposing the conduct, according to the probability of malignancy and are currently divided into BI-RADS 1,2 3, 4 and 5, even though BIRADS 5 can only be described with the finding of malignancy by histological analysis [6,8] .",

            "text": "Background Extensive malignant-appearing calcifications have traditionally been considered a contraindication for breast-conserving surgery. The evaluation of calcifications largely depends on mammography, which is limited by tissue superimposition and is unable to reveal spatial information about extensive calcifications. Three-dimensional imaging modality is needed to reveal the architecture of extensive calcifications. In the present study, a novel cone-beam breast CT-guided surface location technique was investigated to facilitate breast-conserving surgery in breast cancer patients with extensive malignant breast calcifications. Methods Biopsy-proved early breast cancer patients with extensive malignant-appearing breast calcifications were included. A patient will be considered suitable for breast-conserving surgery if the spatial segmental distribution of calcifications is found by 3D images of cone-beam breast CT. Then, the margins of the calcifications were located in contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT images. Next, skin markers were located using radiopaque materials, and cone-beam breast CT was reperformed to confirm the accuracy of surface location. During breast-conserving surgery, lumpectomy was performed according to the previous surface location, and an intraoperative specimen x-ray was applied to double-check that the entire lesion was removed. Margin assessment was made for both intraoperative frozen section and postoperative pathology examination. Results From May 2019 to Jun 2022, 11 eligible breast cancer patients in our institution were included. Breast-conserving surgery was performed successfully in all patients using the surface location approach mentioned before. All patients achieved negative margins and satisfied cosmetic results. Conclusion This study proved the feasibility of cone-beam breast CT-guided surface location for facilitating breast-conserving surgery in breast cancer patients with extensive malignant breast calcifications.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the prevalent malignancy in women worldwide, and in 2020 with an estimated 2.3 million new patients and 685,000 mortality cases (Sung et al., 2021), accounting for 30% of new female tumors in 2021 (Siegel et al., 2021). It is a serious threat to women's health and an important cause of female death. The preferred treatment for breast cancer is surgical excision combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2020b). The surgical outcome and patient prognosis depend largely on the complete resection rate of the tumor. Postoperative tumor residue was associated with poor prognosis, high recurrence rate, and low survival rate. The higher the tumor resection rate is, the longer the overall survival of patients (Kimbrough et al., 2013;McCann et al., 2013;Tummala et al., 2013). At present, the extent of surgical resection still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. However, the visual and tactile distinction between tumor and healthy tissue is not effective, making it difficult to determine the surgical margins and leaving tiny lesions that can lead to recurrence and spread after surgery, while the quality of life of patients is seriously affected if the extent of surgical excision is excessively extended. Therefore, the key to the success of surgery is how to accurately locate and image tumors and their microscopic lesions intraoperatively and how to maximize the removal of tumors while protecting healthy tissues as much as possible. Recently, molecular imaging techniques has rapidly advancing in the field of bioimaging due to its advantages of great sensitivity, speedy and immediate imaging, biological safety, ease of detection and low cost, etc. Fluorescence imaging-guided surgery brings hope to solving the abovementioned challenges (Antaris et al., 2016;Zheng et al., 2017;Qi et al., 2018). \n\nMolecular imaging techniques allows non-invasive real-time tumor diagnosis and imaging-guided surgery, assisting surgeons in detecting and resecting tiny tumors sensitively and accurately, significantly improving the therapeutic outcome of tumor surgery.",

            "title": "Use of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy for breast cancer: a scoping review protocol",
            "text": "Background In recent years, we have seen the incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulators into radiotherapy centres and the emergence of the new technology of MR linacs. However, the significant health care resources associated with this advanced technology impact immediate widespread use and availability. There are currently limited studies to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness and inform decision-making on the use of MRI in radiotherapy. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the existing evidence surrounding the clinical implementation of MRI-guided radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer . It also aims to identify challenges and knowledge gaps in the literature. Methods We will perform a comprehensive search in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 2010 onwards. Grey literature sources will include the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We will include systematic reviews, randomised and non-randomised controlled studies published in English. Literature should examine the use of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy in adults with breast cancer, regardless of cancer stage or severity. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts and full-text reports. Data will be extracted and summarised using qualitative (e.g. content and thematic analysis) methods and presented in tables. Discussion The results from this review will consolidate the evidence surrounding MRI-guided radiotherapy for breast cancer, contributing to the development and optimisation of patient selection, simulation, planning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and research, to help improve patient outcomes, cancer care and treatment for women with breast cancer. Systematic review registration The protocol is available on Open Science Framework at DOI https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8TEV6",

            "text": "Current surgical options for the treatment of breast cancer include mastectomy and breast conserving surgery (BCS). Recent data show that approximately 50% of newly diagnosed patients will be treated with BCS [2]. A 1990 consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health advocated breast conserving therapy (BCT), defined as breast conserving surgery plus adjuvant radiation, as the preferred approach for patients presenting with stage I or II breast cancers [3,4]. The National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers has a target goal of at least 50% of eligible patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing BCT as a standard for clinical management [5]. \n\nThe cornerstone of BCS is the ability to resect the primary tumor with a negative margin while maintaining enough breast parenchyma for an optimal cosmetic outcome. One pitfall of BCS, and perhaps a factor in patients' surgical decision making, is the potential need for re-excision (rates between 20 and 60%) for positive or close margins [6e11]. Re-excision remains a particularly vexing problem for both clinicians and patients undertaking BCT. There are both psychological and financial burdens to patients associated with the need for re-operation following initial BCS. \n\nVarious methodologies of specimen examination have been employed to attempt to decrease the rate of positive margins. Routine utilization of some type of intraoperative margin assessment (including specimen radiograph, gross margin analysis, or intraoperative frozen section) has been shown to decrease reexcision rates [12]. However, there is yet to be a national standardized practice of evaluating resected specimens at the time of initial operation. Routine cavity shaved margins has also been studied as way to decrease re-excision rates but this practice has not been shown to alter re-excision rates [10]. \n\nThe issue has also been complicated by the evolving definition of a \"negative\" margin, and what margin width is sufficient to avoid re-excision. The 2014 consensus statement from the Society of Surgical Oncology and American Society for Radiation Oncology supported the use of \"no ink on tumor\" as a negative margin for BCT for patients with stage I or II invasive breast cancers [13].",

            "text": "At UTMCK, we use a multidisciplinary approach for all cases of breast cancer. Our surgeons all provide the same data and options to patients when considering BCT or therapeutic mastectomy (TM) with or without contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). We explain to our patients that survival outcomes are no different, only local recurrence is slightly higher in BCT and document this in dictated counseling office notes. Patients are also offered consultation with plastics and reconstructive surgeon to discuss all of their cosmetic concerns. Because there is an increased risk of a second contralateral breast cancer, patients are counseled on the National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) guidelines to continue screening for recurrence as well as cancer in the contralateral breast to include physical exam and mammography. \n\nThe 1991 consensus statement by the National Cancer institute supported breast conserving surgery as the preferred treatment for early stage breast cancers [17] . However, we have seen an increase in patients with documented early stage disease electing to undergo CPM when diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer from 1.8 to 4.5% from 1997 to 2003 [2] . There have been many theories on why this is occurring, such as increased use of preoperative MRI, genetic testing, and demand for surgery due to availability of immediate reconstruction [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] . Multiple studies were reviewed by Cochrane and found that whereas CPM decreases the risk of contralateral breast cancer, it did not impact overall survival [27] . A 20-year follow up demonstrated an overall survival of 46% and 47% for breast conservation and mastectomy respectively and local recurrence was 8.8% and 2.3% respectively [3] . Analysis of the SEER database over ten years for patients with unilateral breast cancer found that young age, white race, lobular histology, recent year of diagnosis and large tumor size were associated with increased CPM rates [4,5] . A large cancer center retrospective review from 1994-1998 found that age younger than 40, large tumor size and lymphovascular invasion were all predictors of mastectomy [28] .",

            "text": "The current study presents the potential application of a CNN with mEfficientDet, YOLO v5, and RetinaNet networks as robotic mastectomy surgical guides for beginners or trainees. The accuracy of the surgical guide in predicting the dissection plane of the skin flap during the console procedure of robotic mastectomy was evaluated by the DSC and HD, and the prediction results of the surgical guide were acceptable. \n\nWe also demonstrated that real-time image analysis of robotic breast surgery could be implemented using a video clip (Video 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DL application in robotic mastectomy for developing a visual surgical guide. \n\nIn clinical practice, tunneling loosens the subcutaneous tissue before dissection and guides the proper dissection planes. The proper thickness of the skin flap or the presence of residual breast tissue is strongly related to postoperative complications such as skin necrosis and breast cancer recurrence [22][23][24]. However, during the console procedure, the operator cannot estimate the thickness of the skin flap by touch. Because of the lack of haptic function of the robotic surgical system, a surgical guide for the dissection of the skin flap could improve the postoperative complications and local recurrence rates of breast cancer. In particular, as an effective educational program for beginners or residents, the surgical guide can provide consistent and accurate training not only for RNSM but BMI, body mass index also for endoscopic surgery. Therefore, it will be possible to apply the results of this study to the education and clinical practice of endoscopic breast surgery, which has been difficult for many surgeons to access easily due to the difficulty in achieving proficiency. While RNSM is in its infancy, previous studies have presented the clinical safety and postoperative outcomes [25][26][27]. Consequently, this could contribute to the expansion of various breast surgical procedures, education, and improved surgical outcomes. This study has several limitations. First, we collected the video clips used for developing the surgical guide from a single surgeon, which limits the generalizability of the results. However, because robot-assisted breast surgery is still in its early stages, video clips are lacking.",

BI-RADS category 3 was also given to newly found lesions if its findings were probably benign according to the BI-RADS MR lexicon [17]. For breast or chest wall lesions that were assessed as BI-RADS category 4 or 5, targeted US was first performed and US-guided biopsy or MR-guided biopsy was performed accordingly.

Because most of MBC are HER2-negative, targeted therapy is thought be less likely to influence the survival. \n\nIn conclusion, by using the SEER database which contained information from a widespread population throughout the United States, we investigated the relationship between survival outcomes and surgical approaches for patients with early-stage MBC. Our study demonstrated that BCT conferred superior OS and BCSS compared with mastectomy for patients with early-stage MBC, and the improvement persisted in almost all of the subgroups of AJCC T and N stages, providing the knowledge in decision-making of surgical options for patients with early-stage MBC.",

            "text": "Based on the latest data in 2019 (1), breast cancer accounts for approximately 30% of new cancer cases and is the most prevalent malignant tumor in American women. New techniques in medical imaging, which include mammography, ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have improved the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Furthermore, these imaging modalities have facilitated imaging-guided breast biopsy, including image-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), core needle biopsy (CNB), vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB), and fine needle localization. Moreover, the concept of minimally invasive surgery has been increasingly applied to breast cancer treatment. \n\nThe VABB technique has been widely used for diagnosing breast lesions (2), especially for multiple or nonpalpable breast masses and microcalcifications of extreme size (3). In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VABB for the removal of benign lesions, as it is considered safe, provides effective complete excision, and cosmetic benefits (4). Previous studies (3,5) have evaluated the usefulness and safety of VABB; it is believed that VABB could replace FNAB and CNB for the diagnosis of breast disease. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 20,000 people from 36 longitudinal studies (6), the pooled data suggested that VABB with US or mammography could be promising for the diagnosis of breast disease. \n\nThe diagnostic usefulness of VABB in breast diseases has been proved over the years (7,8), and is even being explored in breast lesions that cannot be detected by other imaging modalities (9,10). The development of VABB has enabled the excision of benign breast tumors and complete excision is possible without residual tumor tissue (3,6). VABB has proven useful even for phyllodes tumors, which have a tendency of recurrence; using VABB to excise benign phyllodes tumors showed a low recurrence rate of 7.46% during the follow-up period (11). Researchers have also tried to evaluate the use of VABB in breast-conserving surgery (12,13).",

Compared to mastectomy, lumpectomy when used in conjunction with radiation therapy has equivalent survival outcomes, and is the preferred surgical intervention for early stage breast cancer [2][3][4][5]. However, due to failure to achieve clear or negative margins in lumpectomy, 20 -40% of patients require additional operative intervention in the form of re-excision or mastectomy [6][7][8][9][10]. Therefore, the ability to obtain accurate intraoperative feedback about margin status will reduce the need for re-excision and surgery related cost. Currently, there have been multiple existing or emerging intraoperative",

            "text": "The first limitation of the study is the small sample size. Second, we did not correlate with cancer stage at diagnosis, which might influence imaging features.Third,we did not correlate the hormonal status of the patient and the lesion visibility on MRI.Fourth, is there an imaging-histologic correlation, or do the biopsy results sufficiently explain the imaging findings?As a consequence, long-term follow-up MRI is strongly recommended to the high risk patients. Finally,the samples wasn't involved in small volume breast.The requirements for wire localization of the compressed breast is more than 25mm, however, the thickness of most Chinese women is less than 25mm after fixed and compressed. Therefore, small volume breast cannot meet the needs of the MRI-guided wire localization biopsy device. \n\nIn conclusion, in our initial study, we have identified that MRI-guided breast lesion wire localization is safely, easily and effectively performed for obtaining occult breast lesions without major complications. During our initial experience a success rate of 100% was achieved, which was quite satisfactory. MRI-guided wire localization breast biopsy may contribute to the early diagnosis of breast cancer patients in China. MRI-guided biopsy is the only method that can confirm suspicious enhancing breast lesions in these patients, although it does pose some challenges.And we believe that MRI-guided wire localization breast biopsy will be an important diagnostic modality with careful preparation, proper positioning, and directional localization in Chinese women. Furthermore ,continued work will address the use of the early diagnosis of the small volume breast cancer avoid penetrating into the breast, as well as the use ofMRI-guidedvacuumassisted breast biopsy in China.",

Moving forward, such combinatorial approaches for metastatic breast cancer need to be thoroughly evaluated in clinical settings. \n\nAs diagnostic and treatment modalities for breast masses improve, focus shifts to minimally invasive therapeutic techniques that achieve disease control without sacrificing functionality, cosmetic appearance, and quality of life. Image guided, thermal ablative techniques including ultrasound or MRI guided RFA, MWA, and cryoablation, are ideal modalities for the treatment of small, early-stage breast cancers, nonmalignant masses, and in non-surgical candidates. The physiologic efficacy in inducing coagulative necrosis of breast masses has been well established. However, well designed and well controlled studies comparing ablative techniques to the standard of care are truly necessary to determine the impact on local and distant disease recurrence and quality of life outcomes.",

In fact, surgery with chemotherapy was the most common combination used out of an array of combinations with radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Unilateral mastectomy and ANC was the procedure used for 34.5% of the patients. The majority of women receiving chemotherapy and surgery had stage 2A breast cancer (23.1%). This group of women had the most unilateral mastectomies, as well as the most unilateral mastectomy and axillary clearance combined. As far back as 1988, Daisley et al 47 showed that 48% of patients with breast cancer in Trinidad and Tobago were diagnosed with stage 2A breast cancer, and that mastectomy with axillary clearance was the preferred surgical procedure. 47 In 2012, nearly 25 years later, the pattern of disease or surgical intervention has not changed. Furthermore, the predominant histological type (invasive ductal carcinoma) remains the most common histologically type reported (n = 429; 67.0%). \n\nOnly 36.2% of patients received radiotherapy as part of their treatment. Radiotherapy is now a clinically essential part of the armamentarium against cancer. In fact, about 70%-83% of breast cancer patients would be expected to undergo radiotherapy. 48 The WHO, in its world cancer report, has also clearly articulated the role for radiotherapy as part of the multimodality and multidisciplinary management of patients with cancer. The report states, \"\u2026 it is essential for good cancer care: chemotherapy and surgery cannot effectively replace it. Where it is not available 50% of cancer patients are being denied appropriate care.\" 2 The mammogram as a diagnostic tool was used in less than 7% of patients and none of the women had prior screening.

            "title": "MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY: A PROMISING APPROACH IN BREAST CANCER TREATMENT",
            "text": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in the treatment of breast cancer, offering numerous benefits over traditional surgical methods. This technique combines advanced technologies and breast preservation strategies, enabling more precise and less traumatic procedures for patients. By minimizing physical and psychological impact, MIS promotes faster recovery times and enhances the overall quality of life for patients. Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of MIS, particularly for early-stage breast cancer. Procedures such as breast-conserving surgery, which may include lumpectomy or the use of minimally invasive tools like high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), offer an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments like mastectomy. These techniques are especially valuable for managing patients' aesthetic concerns and emotional expectations, as they reduce scarring and preserve the breast's natural appearance. Moreover, MIS generally leads to shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operative pain, and lower complication rates. Despite these advantages, the choice of surgical method must be tailored to each patient, taking into account the specific characteristics of the tumor, the patient's health status, and personal preferences. While MIS is not suitable for all cases, it presents a highly effective option for many patients with early-stage breast cancer, providing excellent clinical and cosmetic outcomes. Looking ahead, ongoing research will continue to refine and expand the use of minimally invasive techniques. As these procedures evolve, it is expected that MIS will play a more central role in breast cancer treatment, providing less invasive, more effective alternatives that significantly improve patient outcomes.",

            "text": "Herein, we report the dosimetric feasibility of SABR and PBT for the hypofractionated definitive treatment of early stage breast cancer. In this analysis, 3-dimensional CRT plans demonstrated lower PTV coverage and often delivered higher doses to normal structures relative to SABR and PBT plans, thus supporting the use of more advanced radiation delivery modalities. Intriguingly, SABR and PBT appeared to be feasible methods of dose delivery in the intact setting and allowed for significant minimization of normal tissue radiation, particularly for the lung, breast, and heart. Due to the unique properties of these radiation techniques, each modality offered target coverage and OAR dose reduction in a distinct manner. \n\nHowever, the doses to the chest wall and skin frequently exceeded prespecified dose constraints and were intricately related to the anatomical location of the tumor. For tumors \u22651 cm away from the skin and chest wall, PBT was able to achieve outstanding and consistent target coverage while minimizing OAR doses, particularly integral doses to the lung, heart, and breast tissue. For more challenging tumors that sit closer to the skin, SABR offered target conformality and skin sparing that minimized the maximum doses. Although, maximum point doses to the skin and chest wall were both challenging to minimize in certain anatomical locations, volumetric dose constraints were consistently achievable across platforms. \n\nNearly half of women aged \u226575 years will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and current trends indicate that standard-of-care treatment with breast-conserving surgery in this population is declining. 2 Historical data suggest very poor local control with hormone therapy alone and unacceptable toxicity with conventionally fractionated definitive whole-breast radiation therapy. 7,8 The need for novel treatment modalities to achieve effective local control and reduce treatment-related toxicity is growing. Extrapolation of principles from the modern APBI realm offers a method of target volume reduction, dose escalation, and toxicity minimization in the definitive setting. 20 Contemporary methods of APBI delivery include SABR and PBT, both of which are used for an expanding variety of malignancies and are becoming more ubiquitous forms of radiation treatment in the United States.",

BC treatment and outcomes are getting improved due to advances in screening -tumor detection in early stage and effective, multimodality care [2,3]. BC treatment choice requires an individual approach, taking into account factors related to a patient, stage of disease, and cancer molecular subtype. In early-stage BC, surgery is a first-chose therapy. The surgical management of BC involves breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy (including skinsparing and nipple-sparing types) and modified radical mastectomy [4]. Each surgical method is associated with different rates of surgical morbidity and complications. Radiation following mastectomy in patients with positive lymph nodes is associated with improved survival rates compared to patients with negative lymph nodes [5]. Whether human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is expressed on cancer cells, it is possible to use anti-HER2 agents [6]. Endocrine therapy is used among patients with positive receptors tumorsestrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive [7]. In adjuvant therapy, the most commonly used selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) -tamoxifen is administered independently on menopause status, while aromatase inhibitors are used in postmenopause patients [8]. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogues should be given as adjuvant therapy and after recurrences in women before menopause. In HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors, it is worth considering neoadjuvant chemotherapy [9]. Chemotherapy is given as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment or for metastatic BC [10]. Systemic adjuvant therapy is used in aim to control deposit of disease, and reduce recurrence rates [11].

            "text": "Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or early stage breast cancer account for approximately 64% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (1). For early stage breast cancer patients, adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery is the most commonly utilized treatment approach (49%) (2). Recent advances in breast radiotherapy have enabled shorter treatment courses, smaller radiation fields, prone positioning, and less side effects associated with breast cancer treatment (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10). \n\nMagnetic Resonance-guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) for breast cancer treatment is a potential high impact application of an emerging radiotherapy technology (11,12). Potential advantages of radiotherapy utilizing on-table Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) include enhanced visualization of the surgical cavity after lumpectomy and real time visualization and motion management of the cavity and nearby organs at risk (OARs). Furthermore, adaptive planning with MRgRT enables customized daily treatment planning to account for day-to-day anatomical variation. Finally, prone positioning during breast irradiation leads to decreased lung and heart radiation doses during treatment (3). By combining MRgRT and adaptive planning with prone positioning, a technique we call precision prone irradiation (PPI), we can improve the therapeutic index of breast radiotherapy by more accurately delivering radiation dose to the cavity target and decreasing toxicities associated with radiation to the surrounding normal tissues. \n\nIn this study, eleven patients with either early stage breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were treated with PPI utilizing prone breast MRgRT and adaptive planning as their adjuvant breast radiotherapy treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported patient experience with this technology to date.",

The superior sensitivity of breast MRI allows for more accurate evaluation of the extent of disease for breast cancer, which is important in an era where de-escalation of treatment is being considered and offered. In this review, we provided a detailed overview of breast MRI and its clinical utility in the management of breast cancer as a foundation for its use in the field of radiation oncology. Specifically, we describe breast MRI technique, anatomy, common breast MR imaging findings, and the role of breast MRI in assessing extent of disease and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy. There has been increased interest in the use of MRI during radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery for patients with early-stage breast cancer as it may allow for more personalized radiotherapy. Abstract Contrast-enhanced breast MRI has an established role in aiding in the detection, evaluation, and management of breast cancer. This article discusses MRI sequences, the clinical utility of MRI, and how MRI has been evaluated for use in breast radiotherapy treatment planning. We highlight the contribution of MRI in the decision-making regarding selecting appropriate candidates for breast conservation therapy and review the emerging role of MRI-guided breast radiotherapy.",

            "text": "Accurate initial evaluation of disease spread is important for treatment selection and prognostication in breast cancer. The initial staging work-up includes many conventional imaging modalities, such as mammography, magnetic resonance mammography, plain chest radiography, bone scintigraphy, and breast, axillary, and liver ultrasonography [10,11]. Studies comparing the impact of FDG PET/CT for initial staging of therapy na\u00efve breast cancer with conventional imaging tools have shown that FDG PET/CT has the added benefit of the detection of extra-axillary (infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and internal mammary) lymph nodal metastasis and occult distant metastasis. Additional findings revealed by PET/CT may prompt a considerable change in the staging and management of 25% and 18% of breast cancer patients, respectively [13][14][15][16]. \n\nNevertheless, the exact clinical stage at which PET/CT can be performed with wellbalanced cost-effectiveness is uncertain [9]. The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines suggest that PET/CT scanning should be performed for patients with stage III disease or when standard staging studies yield non-diagnostic or suspicious results [2]. The NCCN guidelines further state that \"PET/CT may be helpful in identifying unsuspected regional nodal disease and/or distant metastasis in locally advanced breast cancer in addition to standard studies and is not recommended in the staging of clinical stage I, II, or operable III (T3 N1) breast cancer, due to its high false-negative rate for the detection of lesions that are small (<1 cm) and/or low-grade disease, the high rate of false-positive scans in patients without locally advanced disease.\" However, meta-analyses suggest that a non-negligible proportion of even stage 1 disease (11%) and stage II disease (20%) is upstaged by FDG PET/CT imaging. Another study reported upstaging to stage IV of 14% (27/196) in patients with findings of unsuspected distant metastasis, including 13% of stage IIB (10/79) and 22% of stage III disease [17].",

It is suitable for screening of, \"BRCA1.2 positive\" women and for monitoring of chemotherapy. On the other hand it is inappropriate for young symptomatic women with dense breasts, in cases of clustered microcalcification or for differentiation of inflammation from inflammatory (erysipeloid) carcinoma.\n\nAuthor also describes recommended techniques of imaging and evaluation with emphasis on standardization of procedure. He shows typical cases. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the breast has proved to be a valuable tool in the detection and work-up of breast lesions. Most of these lesions are small and not visible by other imaging modalities such as mammography or US. Thus, MRguided preoperative localization techniques or MR-guided percutaneous biopsy can provide a histologic work-up of such lesions. MR-guided preoperative localization seems to be a well-established procedure. However, MR-guided biopsy is still problematic. Although prototypic biopsy systems have been developed, considerable progress is still required. Thus, needle biopsy currently is not recommended for lesions smaller than 10 mm. Beside the potential of MR imaging of the breast for monitoring of interventional procedures MR imaging provides also the impetus for the development of dedicated systems for MR-guided therapy. A variety of minimally invasive procedures have already been used to characterize and treat breast lesions. These therapies include thermal treatments, percutaneous excision or breast lumpectomy, and interstitial radiotherapy. This course reviews current techniques for MR-guided preoperative localization and percutaneous biopsy in breast lesions. The diagnostic accuracy achievable with these techniques will be discussed. Potential for new research opportunities and directions will be provided. MR screening in high-risk patients is now a validated indication with several reports demonstrating its effectiveness for detecting breast cancer. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has a high sensitivity but a limited specificity, due to the non selective extravasation of gadolinium chelates from blood into the interstitium of both normal and pathological tissues. New techniques can be added to improve these results. The high capillary perfusion of cancers can be assessed with",

            "text": "Background Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies in women worldwide, and the disease burden continues to aggravate. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging information is crucial for oncology physicians to develop appropriate clinical strategies. This study aimed to investigate the value of a radiomics-clinical model for predicting TNM stage in breast cancer patients using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Methods DCE-MRI images from 166 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer were retrospectively collected, including early stage (TNM0\u2013TNM2) and locally advanced or advanced stage (TNM3\u2013TNM4). Included patients were divided into a training cohort (n=116) and a test cohort (n=50). The radiomics, clinical and integrated models were constructed and a nomogram was established to distinguish the TNM0\u2013TNM2 stage from the TNM3\u2013TNM4 stage. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to assess the predictability of the models. Results Eighty-five patients were at the early stages, while 81 patients were at the other stages. In the training and test cohorts, the area under the curve (AUC) values for distinguishing early and advanced breast cancer were 0.870 and 0.818 for the nomogram, respectively. The nomogram calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted and observed TNM stages in the training and test cohorts. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the nomogram fit perfectly in the two cohorts. DCA indicated that the nomogram displayed clear superiority in forecasting TNM staging over clinical and radiomic signatures. Conclusions Compared to traditional imaging methods, the clinical-radiomics nomogram acquired by DCE-MRI could potentially be utilized to preoperatively evaluate the TNM stage of breast cancer with relatively high accuracy. It can be an effective method to guide clinical decisions.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, excluding skin cancer, and the second most common cause of cancer related death in women [1]. In the United States, breast cancer affects one in eight women over the course of their lifetime [2]. Breast cancers range from small early-stage tumors to larger locally advanced cancers. Early stage breast tumors tend to be less than 2 cm in size and low in histologic grade. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), on the other hand, is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer (mainly stage III) that is clinically characterized as being larger than 5 cm, often unresectable, and with chest wall, ipsilateral supraclavicular, infraclavicular, skin, or lymph node involvement. Despite treatment efforts using systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, estimated 3-and 5-year survival rates of 70% and 55% were reported, respectively, in the United States in 2004 for women with stage III breast cancer [3]. LABC outcomes are typically worse, with 5-year survival rates less than 50% [4]. \n\nAn accurate diagnosis of breast tumors plays an important role in prognosis and therapy planning, and can improve overall survival. Xray mammography is currently the primary imaging modality for breast examinations. However, mammographic sensitivity declines significantly with increasing breast density particularly in young women [5]. Clinical ultrasound, when performed in conjunction with mammography, has been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver-operator characteristic [ROC] curve) from 0.78 to 0.91 [6]. However, due to the many instrument parameters that can be chosen during an ultrasound imaging session, a comparative interpretation of conventional B-mode images becomes difficult when different imaging settings are applied or when different ultrasound machines are used. In addition, B-mode images, which are used by radiologists for breast examination, lack readily accessible information about microstructural properties of soft tissues. This information is lost when raw ultrasound data, or radiofrequency (RF) data, are converted to gray-scale pixels. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques, which examine the frequency dependence of backscatter from tissues (from analyzed RF data), have been developed to overcome these limitations.",

            "text": "Breast cancer may manifest as locally advanced, metastatic or in an early stage at the time of diagnosis. [1,2] Early operable breast cancer patients undergo breast conservative surgery or total mastectomy. The presence of N3 nodes that is either ipsilateral infraclavicular node (N3a) or ipsilateral internal mammary and axillary nodes (N3b) or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes (N3c) upstages the disease to IIIC changing the course of treatment to essential pre-surgical induction chemotherapy. [3] Detection of distant non-regional nodal or organ metastases will imply a more aggressive approach focusing more towards a palliative treatment. [4] Therefore, it is necessary to correctly stage the patient's disease [3] for optimization of therapy and this includes the assessment of primary tumor, regional lymph nodes and spread to distant sites. [5] For local staging of primary breast cancer, mammography is still the most widely utilized modality usually complemented with ultrasound (US), imaging-guided biopsy plus MRI mammography if indicated. Additional investigations for metastatic workup include Chest X-ray \u00b1 CT chest if indicated, ultrasound abdomen \u00b1 CT abdomen if indicated and bone scan if indicated. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in oncology recommend 18F-FDG PET/CT as category 2B option for the workup of a breast cancer patient. [6] PET-CT is usually not recommended for early and operable breast cancer. [6] However, this current and routine algorithm of Diagnostic Imaging to stage early and operable breast cancer can miss the micrometastases in different regional, non-regional lymph nodes and distant organs as they might appear normal as per size and morphology criteria. [7] 18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET-CT provides important tumor-related qualitative and quantitative metabolic information that may be critical for the diagnosis and follow-up. [7,8] It is the significant FDG uptake with a significant SUV value that exceeds the blood pool level, even in the normal-looking nodes and organs that helps to pick up the metastases.",

            "text": ". As reported by the registry of the Japan Breast Cancer Society (2015), BCT is now used to treat 50% of breast cancer patients. The long-term success of BCT is influenced by the rate of local control and the preserved breast's cosmetic appearance. There are several strategies involved in this field. Tumor burden diagnosis [28] and breast margin pathological diagnosis [12,29] are among the main strategies. Moreover, primary chemotherapy can be used for conservation of breast, particularly when breast cancer is in advanced stage [30]. There are several types of BCSs that can be used to obtain good cosmetic results, including lateral tissue flap, inframammary adipofascial flap [31], the moving window technique [32]. In this study, various procedures have been applied for replacing defects of partial resections. These categories are mainly known as oncoplastic breast-conserving surgeries. Fat necrosis can negatively affect the quality of life of the patients because of poor cosmetic result and pain. Unfortunately, fat necrosis cannot be efficiently evaluated because there are no standard systems for grading [33]. Breast surgeons need to explain the severity and of frequency fat necrosis to the patients. For this purpose, it is highly recommended that annual mammography and physical examinations be performed, particularly for those who have undergone BCT [34].\n\nIt is still challenging to manage fat in practice. It can still be difficult to diagnose female breast fat necrosis, even via advanced diagnostic instruments. Cancer recurrence and fat necrosis need to be differentiated, especially in patients undergone surgery of breast conservation. In certain cases, diagnosis confirmation can be done through the needle core biopsy. There has been an increase in the number of early-stage breast cancer due to the mammographic screening programs [35]. BCS is a standard care in breast cancer patients at early stages [24]. According to research, compared to mastectomy, BCS offers equal rates of survival (over 20 years) [36]. Reducing postoperative deformities and promoting safe breast conservation are possible through BOS [37,38]. After surgery and radiation therapy, the breast tissue undergoes various changes. This can complicate the interpretation of image during the period of follow-up, particularly when there is",

            "text": "Background and Objective: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with adjuvant radiotherapy remains the standard of care for early breast cancers in Pakistan. We sought to compare the outcomes of BCS with oncoplastic surgery (OPS), a relatively infrequent approach to breast cancer treatment in the country. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital in Karachi. Patients who had biopsy-proven Stage-I to III breast cancer and underwent either OPS or BCS between August 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, were identified and followed for 30 days. Data were collected by reviewing patient files and electronic records. Results: A total of 481 patients were included in the study, where 204 (42.4%) underwent BCS and 277 (57.6%) underwent OPS. Mean tumor volume (146.8 vs. 90.4 cm3), and postoperative complications (2.2 % vs. 0%) were higher in OPS while the frequency of positive margins was greater in the BCS group (15.7 % vs. 2.2 %). There were no significant differences in the histologic type of tumor between the two groups. Conclusion: OPS is a valid alternative approach to breast cancer treatment that can be offered to women with early stage, locally advanced, multifocal or tumors at complex locations owing to the reduced occurrence of positive margins and thus lowered re-excision rates.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of death in women worldwide, of which invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common pathological type. In China, newly diagnosed breast cancer cases accounts for 16.72% (n=306,000) of all new cancer cases and the number of deaths accounts for 8.12% (n=71,700) of the total cancer-related deaths in women (1,2). The current treatment for breast cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, among which surgery is the first choice for early-stage breast cancers (3). Lymphoma represents a diverse group of diseases caused by clonal proliferation of lymphocytes (4). Lymphomas usually involve lymphoid organs and tissues. However, about 40% of lymphomas can also be located outside the lymph nodes (5). Breast lymphoma is a rare disease, the incidence of which is less than 0.5% of all breast malignancies, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of breast lymphoma (6). Breast lymphoma usually presents as a painless palpable mass, which is indistinguishable from breast cancer, and the common imaging examinations include mammographic, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are unable to distinguish lymphoma from breast cancer (7,8). The most common diagnostic methods used to differentiate breast lymphoma from breast cancer are physical examination or image-guided needle biopsy (9). However, needle biopsy is an invasive technique which can damage normal breast tissue; misdiagnosis can occur if necrotic tissue is pierced when puncturing a large breast nodule containing necrotic tissue. Furthermore, as breast lymphoma is a rare disease with a low incidence, many breast nodules are misdiagnosed as breast cancer and are surgically removed directly (10).",

Following clinical examination and imaging assessment, percutaneous biopsy is required for lesions suspicious for malignancy. \n\nUS is the modality of choice for image-guided biopsy of soft lesions that are visible on the US and is usually performed free-handed using core biopsy sampling. 9 Various robotic systems [10][11][12][13] for USbased needle guidance have been developed at the experimental level through the years to facilitate doctors. 14 Stereotactic mammography guidance is usually the gold standard for tumours that are not visible on US images, such as microcalcifications. Accordingly, there are several commercially available robotic mechanisms for needle alignment under the specific modality. 15,16 I is increasingly being used as the guidance modality for breast biopsy, especially for women with a high risk of breast cancer. 17 Since small lesions may not be detectable with the standard methods, 18 MRI-guided biopsy is needed to histologically determine the possible malignancy of the tumour. A wide variety of robotic systems that can be utilised in combination with an MRI scanner for automatic positioning of the needle have been developed so far, 4,[19][20][21] thus addressing the requirement to move the patient out of the scanner multiple times and pointless acquisition of a large tissue volume, as well as reducing the procedure duration. \n\nThese systems address challenges regarding safe operation of robotics in the MRI environment. \n\nSuch robotic-assisted approaches require high accuracy and precision in order to reach a target with minimal invasion and fulfil the clinical requirement. All methodologies for testing a robot's mechanical accuracy as well as the accuracy and repeatability of positioning a biopsy needle are based on comparing the intended with the actual motion step as determined using a distance-measuring method. 22,23",

The administration of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks to the whole breast was considered the standard until a few years ago, when the publication of the long-term results of important British and Canadian randomized studies proved the effectiveness and efficiency of schemes administered over shorter times (hypofractionated radiotherapy) (1, 2). \n\nFurthermore, in the past 10 years, the possibility of treating only the tumor bed has been analyzed, as ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR) developed in and around the tumor bed in 44-86% of cases (3), and treatment of the rest of the breast might be unnecessary. Indeed, by limiting irradiation to the area of potential recurrence by means of partial breast irradiation (PBI), much of the surrounding tissues (including the lung, heart, uninvolved ipsilateral breast) could be spared, thereby reducing toxicity and improving the cosmetic outcome (4,5). \n\nSeveral techniques of PBI exist: brachytherapy (intracavitary and interstitial approaches), external beam radiation using either three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiation therapy, and proton radiation. However, all these procedures involve the use of several radiation fractions, requiring the patients to attend the Radiotherapy Department on several days. This difficulty can be overcome by another PBI modality, namely intraoperative radiation therapy with an electron beam (IORT-E), which selectively treats the breast volume in which the tumor was located by delivering a single dose of radiation at the time of surgery, after complete removal of the tumor. This procedure reduces treatment time and, potentially, improves the patient's quality of life.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy and leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women [1]. Distant metastasis is seen in nearly one-fourth of BC patients, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% [2]. Treatments for BC include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (RT), depending on the disease stage. However, patients with metastatic BC have a low likelihood of prolonged remission or cure. Systemic chemotherapy and/or hormonotherapy is therefore preferred in most of the metastatic BC patients, and in some cases palliative RT or surgery is recommended. Accurate staging is thus essential for the proper management and treatment of BC. \n\nStaging and consideration of BC that has spread beyond the breast is typically divided into regional lymph nodes (particularly axillary lymph nodes) and the non-regional lymphatic system or distant organs. Almost all BC patients undergo axillary staging with surgery, while systemic staging is performed radiologically. However, systemic staging is not recommended unless the patient is symptomatic in patients with early-stage disease [3]. Systemic staging is often performed for locally advanced BC, recurrent BC, or BC with known metastases [4,5]. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Practice guidelines, systemic staging is based on conventional imaging modalities, including chest radiography or computed tomography (CT), abdominal ultrasonography or CT, and bone scintigraphy, depending on disease stage [6,7]. However, the systemic staging of patients with conventional imaging is limited by the low sensitivity of these methods. More recently, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDGePET/CT), with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting lymph node and distant metastases, has proven useful for determining the extent of disease in various cancer types, and in patients with BC [8e13]. Although FDG-PET/CT is recommended for patients with either recurrent or stage IV disease according to guidelines, its use in BC patients for staging increases dramatically [7,10].",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and, each year, more than 1 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide (McPherson et al, 2000). Radical and modified radical mastectomy including axillary lymph node dissection has long been regarded as appropriate therapies. During the last two decades, significant advances have been made in the development of early detection modalities and therapeutic methods. Breast conservation surgery, combined with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, is performed with increasing frequency in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The more from the mastectomy toward breast conservation therapy has not changed long-term survival rates of patients with breast cancer (Veronesi et al, 1993;Fisher et al, 1995;Jacobson et al, 1995;Curran et al, 1998). \n\nIn spite of this progress, much remains to be achieved, and major new therapies will be required to keep on the fight against breast cancer. Recently, cryoablation (Staren et al, 1997), laser (Robinson et al, 1998;Dowlatshahi et al, 2000), radiofrequency (Bohm et al, 2000;McGahan et al, 2000), as minimally invasive modalities, have been studied to explore the possibility of ablating breast lesions. However, these alternative treatments require at least percutaneous access and only destroy small lesion in the management of breast tumours. \n\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive technique for the thermal ablation of solid tumours. Ultrasound (US) beam can be focused and transmitted through solid tissues within the body. This allows the possibility of using an extracorporeal source of US for therapeutic purpose. With realtime image guidance, HIFU could noninvasively induce complete coagulative necrosis of a target tumour, without requiring surgical exposure or insertion of instruments into the lesion. These advantages make it one of the most attractive potential therapies for the localised treatment of tumour.",

Although MRI has high sensitivity, it is associated with a higher rate of false positives and is more expensive than other imaging techniques. \n\nDBT, also known as 3D mammography, is a relatively new imaging modality that acquires multiple lowdose X-ray images at different angles, which are then reconstructed into a three-dimensional representation of the breast [28,29] . DBT improves the detection of breast cancer, particularly in women with dense breasts, by reducing the overlapping of breast tissue seen in conventional mammography. This technology has been shown to increase cancer detection rates and reduce the number of false positives and unnecessary biopsies [30] . \n\nThe role of imaging modalities in breast cancer recognition is vital, as they facilitate early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of the disease. Each modality has its advantages and limitations, and their combined use can provide a comprehensive assessment of breast tissue, improving the accuracy of breast cancer recognition and ultimately enhancing patient care.",

            "text": "BC is the most common malignancy in females and is prevalent in about 11% of the global population. In China, BC is found in about 16% of the population and ranks first among malignancies in female patients [15,16]. BC is caused by the aberrant proliferation of breast epithelial cells due to the effects of carcinogens. Early-stage BC is mainly characterized by mild symptoms such as breast lump and nipple discharge and is hence easily overlooked. However, as BC progresses to the advanced stage, cancer cells metastasize and invade multiple organs such as the lungs, pleura, bones and liver, which consequently causes multiorgan damage and poses a serious threat to the health of the patients [17]. Treatment plans can vary greatly among BC patients with different staging and conditions. Breast conserving surgery is a surgical method for early breast cancer. The choice of breast conserving surgery and plastic surgery needs to fully consider the size of the breast, the location of the tumor, and whether the breast cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes and other sites. The most important thing is to respect the patient's personal wishes. However, studies found that patients who had traditional BCS alone have significantly lower QoL than those who had post-BCS breast reconstruction [18,19]. De la Cruz Ku et al. [20] showed that physiological and psychological integrity are key measures for evaluating QoL, and breast morphology is an important factor that influences the psychological state of the patients. Therefore, choosing the appropriate surgical method is very important for early-stage BC patients. Although traditional BCS has become the preferred treatment for earlystage BC, its invasiveness, high incidence of postoperative complications, and impact on postoperative breast appearance have substantially decreased patient satisfaction [21]. In addition, traditional BCS not only results in unsatisfactory breast restoration but is also susceptible to cancer recurrence, which consequently increases the psychological pressure of female patients and seriously affects their QoL [22,23]. With the increased application of minimally invasive medicine, OBCS has emerged as a new surgical approach that is gradually being adopted in the clinical treatment of early-stage BC.",

Many modalities are available to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer and include ultrasound, breast mammography, breast MRI, and biopsy. The sensitivities and specificities vary among these. Our patient had ultrasound, breast mammography, breast MRI, and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the left breast lump on her present admission, all of which did not reveal the underlying cancer. \n\nAccording to the American College of Radiology, annual screening for breast cancer should begin at 40 years of age. There is no age limit, but each patient's life expectancy and comorbidities should be considered. 2 Sensitivity for breast mammography in women of this age group is approximately 71%, largely due to denser breast tissue. Whereas sensitivity for 50-69 years of age is >85%. 3 The use of ultrasound as an adjunct to breast mammography for screening has shown an increase of sensitivity to 91% in women aged 40-49 years. 4 RI as a screening modality for breast cancer has been limited to specific populations, however, sensitivity is around 99%. 5 Newer modalities of breast imaging such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) have shown promise. DBT has shown possible risk-benefit ratio for women aged 40-49 years. 6 CESM is highly sensitive and is a potential alternative to MRI. 7 Our patient had a mammogram and breast MRI 2 years prior to her current presentation that demonstrated a leftsided breast mass which was also read as BI-RADS 2. It is likely that her disease started at that time and progressed until her current presentation at an advanced stage. Image findings consistent with BI-RADS 2 are managed with routine mammographic screening. 8 Her breast cancer may have been found at an earlier stage had she had repeat breast imaging. However, the time frame between these initial studies and the present admission was within an acceptable range for screening. \n\nOur patient's background of SLE initially clouded the picture as pericardial effusions have been reported in SLE patients. 9",

            "text": "Purpose There is growing interest in delivering radiation preoperatively (preopRT) rather than postoperatively (postopRT) for breast cancer. Using the National Cancer Database, we evaluated the use and outcomes of preopRT in breast cancer. Methods We identified adult females diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer treated with definitive surgery and radiation between 2004 and 2014. Logistic regression models evaluated factors associated with use of preopRT in early-stage (clinical T1-3/N0-1) and locally advanced (clinical T4/N2-3) disease. Rates of breast-conserving surgery, breast reconstruction, positive surgical margins, and 30-day surgical readmissions were compared between patients receiving preopRT and postopRT. Results Of 373,595 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 1,245 (0.3%) patients received preopRT. Patients receiving preopRT were more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status and have tumors with higher T stage. Younger age and N1 (vs N0) disease predicted for use of preopRT in early-stage disease, while older age and N0 disease predicted for use of preopRT in the locally advanced setting. PreopRT patients were less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery and more likely to have positive surgical margins. Rates of unplanned readmissions within 30 days of surgery were similar among patients treated with preopRT and postopRT. Conclusions PreopRT is a new treatment strategy for patients with breast cancer with different clinical and sociodemographic drivers of its use in the early-stage and locally advanced settings. We await the results of clinical trials studying the efficacy of this approach.",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed to investigate whether outcomes were different by the sequence in which surgery and chemotherapy was delivered, by stage, for GC. As such, our study was limited to only patients who received both surgery and chemotherapy. We found that clinical stage I patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy had a 19% greater risk of death compared to patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no difference in survival between both treatment modalities for stage II patients, while neoadjuvant therapy was beneficial for stage III patients. \n\nThe multimodality approach for locally advanced GC dates to the results of the MAGIC, FNLCC/FFCD, CLASSIC and ACTS-GC landmark trials. 6,9,23,24 These studies demonstrated a survival benefit in patients treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection for locally advanced GC when compared to surgery alone. However, the ideal sequence of treatment therapy has not been universally established and there is regional variation in how multimodality therapy is delivered; in the West, patients typically receive perioperative chemotherapy. One of the most established cancer guidelines used in the United States, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, recommends the use of perioperative chemotherapy for cT2 disease or higher. 29 In the East, surgery is generally performed upfront and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is preferred. \n\nThe different sequence may have potential advantages. A major reason why neoadjuvant therapy has been advocated in the US is that clinical trials show a less than 50% completion of chemotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy before surgery is thought to improve the chances of delivering chemotherapy. 7,9 However, this consideration is distinct than the question that we posed, which is; for people who are able to get both surgery and chemotherapy, does the sequence have an effect on outcomees? Our analysis suggests that for early-stage cancers, surgery upfront followed by adjuvant chemotherapy does not result in inferior outcomes and may even be beneficial. This is an important consideration, particularly for a subset of healthy patients in early stages of cancer who may wish to undergo surgery upfront. Our data also supports the notion that stage III patients benefit from getting chemotherapy before surgery.",

            "text": "methods to mark tumor sites and lymph nodes in the post-NACT setting to guide surgical decisions [2]. \n\nWhen considering breast-conserving surgery (BCS), marker insertion prior to surgery is essential. A marker placed within a hypoechoic lesion can often be clearly visualized on ultrasound (US) [3]. However, in patients with a pathologically complete response (pCR), lesions may shrink significantly and become undetectable on US. In such cases, well-visible breast tissue markers must be placed in these lesions to facilitate optimal surgical planning and outcomes [4]. \n\nAlthough the effectiveness of surgical clip placement has been studied in breast cancer, there is a lack of comparative studies on different types of breast tissue markers after NACT [5]. Understanding which types of markers are more visible on specific imaging modalities is essential, as this knowledge would assist radiologists in selecting the most appropriate marker for each patient before insertion [6]. \n\nThe visibility of the breast tissue marker is crucial for effective localization. While US and mammography can both be used for localization, almost all markers are visible on mammography. However, mammography-guided localization carries radiation risks, making US the more feasible method for localization [7]. \n\nSurgical clips placed in the tumor bed are considered a safe and cost-effective technique for facilitating tumor localization before surgical resection in patients undergoing NACT [8]. The goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of surgical clips and ultrasound-visible tissue markers for tumor localization in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Breast-conserving surgery is a treatment modality for early-stage breast cancer that causes less physical disfigurement and psychological trauma to the patient. Many prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that overall and disease-free survival rates for early-stage breast cancer are equivalent after mastectomy or BCS with postoperative radiotherapy [2][3][4], [8,9]. There appear to be geographical differences in the surgical treatment of earlystage breast cancer. Evidence suggests that physician recommendation exerts the most significant influence on surgical treatment selection for the majority of women [10]. \n\nIn this study only 19% of surgeons used BCS in their practice while the remaining 81% performed mastectomy. This concurs with two other studies, performed in Tehran and Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, showing that mastectomy was the most prevalent surgical treatment for breast cancer patients [6,7]. However, it is arguable that BCS rates would rise in Iran if general surgeons, for exam-ple, could benefit from continuing medical education, attend scientific meetings, and have access to modern textbooks and current journals. Discussion of these topics lies beyond the scope of this study. Briefly, it should be noted that there is a National Society of Surgeons in Iran. In addition to other scientific meetings that address oncology issues, members of this society have their own annual and occasional scientific meetings, and usually receive printed educational materials including issues on current technology. At present all surgeons and radiation therapists in teaching hospitals and many working in the private sector are Board-certified. Some modern radiation therapy facilities in Iran are very similar to existing facilities in developed countries. Furthermore, we suspect that predicting patient non-compliance with radiation therapy might be subjective impressions on the part of the surgeons, since there is no evidence or published data to indicate that patient compliance with radiation therapy is low. \n\nThe findings indicated that gender had no effect on the performance of BCS. This may be due to the small number  of female surgeons in this study. Similarly, in a study comparing rates of BCS between male and female surgeons, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups [11].",

            "text": "Surgical treatment for breast cancer continues to transform with de-escalation as the driving force [1]. Currently, breastconserving surgery is the standard of care for early-stage breast cancer with no significant difference in survival rates compared to mastectomy [2]. Several image-guided percutaneous techniques are at the forefront of the de-escalation movement with cryoablation leading the pack. Early-stage breast cancer for this review is defined as stage 1A with T1 tumors and clinically node-negative lymph nodes. \n\nAblative techniques used in breast cancer are cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) [3]. RFA generates radiofrequency waves in an electric circuit that reaches temperatures between 60 and 100 \u00b0C. The thermal energy causes directed necrosis. RFA has demonstrated high complete ablation rate in tumors < 2 cm but it has not been consistent. Complications have been mostly technical such as probe positioning or skin burns near grounding pads [4]. The majority of studies included general anesthesia although a few studies have demonstrated safety with local anesthesia. A retrospective analysis involving 386 patients by Ito and colleagues revealed 5-year local recurrence-free survival rates of 97% for patients with tumors less than or equal to 1.0 cm in diameter, 94% for patients with tumors measuring 1.1 -2.0 cm, and 87% for patients with tumors measuring 2.1 cm or larger. MWA, another hyperthermic technique, is effective in tissues with high water content which may be advantageous to spare the normal fatty breast tissue with lower water content compared to tumor cells. It has been shown to require shorter treatment times, achieve higher intra-tumoral temperatures, and produce a larger area of necrosis compared to RFA [5]. MWA is more painful than other ablative techniques. HIFU is a non-invasive technique that does not require any skin incision. Studies have demonstrated high technical success rates, which provides the opportunity for simultaneous drug injection. Disadvantages include that durations can last several hours, making patient immobilization difficult which affects success [6].",

            "text": "Medical imaging methods have improved the detection of human diseases with increasing accuracy. The ability to probe molecular processes noninvasively or using tissue\u2010selective imaging agents and nanoparticles has made it possible to localize, identify the stage, and determine the functional status of pathological lesions. The challenges in detecting cancer particularly have driven the development of diverse imaging technologies. While earlier cancer imaging methods enabled preoperative evaluation, the need to track and visualize cancer location in the operating room itself has ushered in new systems capable of providing concurrent images of cancer during surgery. Intraoperative use of conventional clinical imaging modalities is often limited by bulky hardware design, prohibitive cost, lack of real\u2010time image display, and compatibility with conventional hardware interfaces. For these reasons, focus on fluorescence\u2010guided surgery (FGS) devices has increased to take advantage of real\u2010time, high\u2010resolution, functional imaging with hardware that has become increasingly amenable to miniaturization. In particular, the adaptation of wearable devices for FGS presents hands\u2010free capability for optimal navigation during cancer surgery. The evolution of head\u2010mounted devices in the operating room and adaptation for FGS is highlighted. Key challenges to wide clinical adoption of this imaging platform are identified and potential future directions are suggested.",

In a correlation study, Lee et al. 8 found that, in 26% of 38 cases, the presumed sonographic correlate was not the true correlate, as a subsequent MRI-guided biopsy of the actual lesion revealed one malignancy among discordant cases. This is in line with the results of another meta-analysis suggesting that MRI has greater sensitivity than US in detecting nodal metastases. 9 sides its use in diagnosis, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, the most sensitive modality of breast imaging, now plays a crucial role in interventional therapeutic regimens for breast cancer. 10 It offers imaging guidance for tumor localization with the ability to evaluate and adjust probe placement during the operation. Moreover, it performs better than mammography, CT, and US in identifying information about tumor boundary and blood supply. 11 In the minimally invasive treatment of breast cancer under imaging guidance, it has been used frequently [12][13][14][15] to monitor the presence of postoperative residual tumor, fibrous scarring, steatonecrosis, and tumor recurrence after radiotherapy 16 and neoadjuvant surgery. 17",

Furthermore, patient, radiological, and treatment features were evaluated, including age at diagnosis and body mass index (BMI). In particular, data about breast MRI, cytohistological examination from fine-needle aspiration (FNA)/core biopsy, and multicentricity/ multifocality or bilaterality were collected. Cytohistological examinations were determined by a pathologist at the time of surgery. Multicentricity/multifocality was defined as more than one foci of tumor in the same breast at the radiological examination before the surgery, independent of quadrant or distance. \n\nThe type of NACT, either within clinical trials or based on standard guidelines, and the type of breast and axillary surgery and adjuvant treatments were analyzed. Data about pathological downstaging and pCR, defined as no evidence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/is, ypN0), were collected. In patients not achieving pCR, residual cancer burden (RCB) (7) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (8) were assessed. Time from NACT end to surgery and time from surgery to radiation therapy were included in this analysis. Finally, patients' data concerning germline mutational status of BRCA1 or BRCA2 or about other breast/ovarian hereditary cancer syndrome genes, when available, were included as well. \n\nThis retrospective monocentric study was approved by our local Ethical Committee of Area Vasta Emilia Nord (Prot.",

The contralateral or ipsilateral suspicious axilla lymph nodes in patients with ACR BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesion in their breast and those patients whose breast cancer had previously been treated were also indicated. The lesion size was 0.6 cm to 3.3 cm (mean = 1.59 \u00b1 0.76 cm). All biopsies were ultrasound-guided with a free hand approach. Fourteen-gauge (2.1 mm) needles were used with an automatic biopsy gun, and 15 mm shooting was selected (Bard-Magnum Biopsy Instrument, Covington, GA, USA). The number of needle pass was 3 to 5. For the evaluation of any post-procedural complications at the site of the biopsy, all patients underwent clinical examinations a few days after the biopsy. \n\nFor the patients who underwent axillary dissection (n = 4), the number and size of the dissected and metastatic nodes were reported.

            "text": "Medical imaging involves the visualization of the human body, which can act as a guide for clinical diagnosis and medical intervention purposes [1]. These imaging techniques aid in obtaining an overview of the internal functioning non-invasively. Medical imaging using microwaves is a promising technology for imaging the human body in a safe, non-ionizing, and low-cost manner. \n\nMicrowave imaging is being developed by researchers for breast imaging and other biomedical imaging applications. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and also has the highest chance of incidence [2]. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), breast cancer makes up 25% of all new cancer diagnoses among women globally. A crucial point noted from the statistics is that the five-year survival rate for breast cancers detected at an early stage is 80-90%, falling to 24% for those diagnosed at an advanced stage [3]. Thus, an early stage detection is vital, which calls for a safe and cost effective imaging technique. \n\nThe current assessment protocol for the evaluation and characterization of palpable breast lump primarily involves the triple assessment, which involves a three-step process of physical examination, mammography, and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). Screening mammography uses ionizing X-rays for imaging, involves painful breast compression, and also has a high false negative rate (4-34%) and high false positive rate (70%) [4]. FNAC is an invasive step and can only provide the cell cytology information and a suggestive nature of the tissues involved. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a safe imaging technique often used as a supplement to mammography. US has been reported to diagnose cancers at an earlier stage than mammography, and it has a higher sensitivity in comparison to mammography in dense breast cases [5]. This improved cancer detection rate of US comes at the cost of an increased false detection rate. This results in unnecessary biopsies and interventions and also has an adverse psychological impact on patients. Additionally, US is highly operator dependent, and it hardly shows any micro-calcification which is an important sign of breast cancer [6].",

            "text": "Background: Breast cancer is a significant cause of mortality among women worldwide. While there has been increasing focus on breast cancer screening in countries of Central American, limited recent information is available providing national survival rates. This study aimed to determine the 5-year survival rate for women with breast cancer who received treatment through the Costa Rican Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (CCSS) between 2008 and 2012. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of women with breast cancer who received treatment through the CCSS between 2008 and 2012. The Kaplan-Meier (KP) method was used to calculate survival rates, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with survival. Results: The KP method showed a gradual decline in survival over time, declining from 94.4% at 12 months to 76.3% at 5 years. The 5-year survival rates were highest in early-stage (stage I and IIA) and lowest in stage IV; five-year mortality rate among women diagnosed with stage IIIB cancer was four times higher than for those with stage IIB cancer and half that of women diagnosed with metastatic disease. Patients who underwent conservative or radical surgery had decreased risks of mortality compared to those who did not receive surgery. Multivariate analysis identified advanced stage, older age, multifocal tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, triple-negative tumors, and the absence of surgery as significant risk factors for mortality. Conclusion: The 5-year survival rate for women with breast cancer who received treatment through the CCSS between 2008 and 2012 is encouraging, but improvement is needed in early diagnosis and treatment, particularly for women with advanced stages of breast cancer. These findings highlight the need for continued efforts to improve breast cancer detection and treatment in Costa Rica.",

This study investigates the use of a 5-fraction accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) radiation for early breast cancer with or without oncoplastic surgery with the aim to share subjective and objective outcomes, including toxicities and cosmetic results. Methods & Materials: Eligible patients for this single institution phase II trial (IRB 18-002) were aged 50 or older with unifocal stage 0 to 1 breast cancer measuring \u2264 3 cm undergoing breast conserving surgery or oncoplastic reconstruction with negative surgical margins (\u2265 2 mm margin width), ER positive, negative nodes and no lymphovascular invasion. Presurgical MRI was routinely performed. Patients were treated to 30 Gy in 5 fractions via intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a QOD schedule on the Varian Edge radiosurgery system. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the tumor cavity + 1.5 cm cropped 5 mm off skin with the mean PTV30 of 146 cc (range 43-408). Clinical follow-up included history and physical, breast imaging, and the validated Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) at 6 to 12 months intervals. Results: A total of 50 patients with 52 tumors were enrolled with a median age of 76 (range 51 to 89) between November 2018 and July 2022 with 23 patients (46%) undergoing oncoplastic breast surgery. Median follow-up was 37 months (range 9 to 64), the 4-year local control, regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 100%, 96%, 100%, and 94% respectively. There were 2 recurrences (1 regional nodal failure, 1 second primary triple negative breast cancer) and 3 deaths from other causes other than breast cancer occurred in this patient population. Treatment was well tolerated with 22% grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity and 4% late toxicity consisting of grade 1 pain. Physician-rated long-term cosmesis was rated as 83% excellent and 17% good. BCTOS scores at baseline were 58% excellent (91% lumpectomy, 13% oncoplastic), 42% good (9% lumpectomy, 88% oncoplastic), 0% fair to poor, and at \u22652 year follow up were 92% excellent, (100 % lumpectomy, 86% oncoplastic), 8% good (0 % lumpectomy, 14% oncoplastic), and 0% fair to poor. Conclusion: This trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a modernized Florence regimen in low-risk stage 0 to 1 breast cancer patients treated at a community hospital. Long-term cosmetic outcomes were excellent and oncoplastic reconstruction does not appear to be a contraindication for APBI.\n Citation Format: Rachel Radigan, Vani Gupta, Andrew T.

While longer treatment regimens increase pCR rate, early complete responses are also common. We evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on the identification of early complete responders.\n Methods 45 hospitals across the Netherlands participated in the phase 2 TRAIN-3 trial. Patients received neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz). Response to treatment was monitored every three cycles and patients were referred for surgery in case of a radiologic complete response (rCR) or after a maximum of 9 cycles. RCR was defined as the absence of pathological enhancement on MRI breast plus negative vacuum assisted core biopsies in case of hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. In addition, negative fine needle aspiration or lymph node biopsy was required in patients with nodal involvement at baseline. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Here, we report locally assessed rCR and pCR rates after 3, 6 and 9 cycles, the negative predictive value of rCR assessment and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Analyses are stratified by HR-status.\n Results We included 467 patients between April 2019 and May 2021. Median age was 51 years, 69% had stage II disease and 232 had HR+ tumors. 33.6% of HR- patients and 15.5% of HR+ patients achieved pCR after 3 cycles of PTC-Ptz (see table). The NPV was higher in HR- patients and independent of the number of cycles. AE evaluation is currently ongoing.\n Conclusion Three cycles of PTC-Ptz induce an early pCR in one in three HR- and one in six HR+ tumors in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI-based response evaluation identifies these patients with \u00b187% certainty in HR- disease and \u00b158% in HR+ disease. Continuation of PTC-Ptz after 6 cycles further improves pCR rates and can be considered to reduce the need for adjuvant T-DM1.

Notably, patients with positive axillary findings on ultrasound (US) tended to show more extensive axillary nodal metastasis on final histopathological examination. Thus, we aimed to focused on the advanced utility of preoperative axillary US and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in preventing unnecessary axillary surgery in a large series of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with both breast surgery and SLN biopsy.\n Methods:\n Between January 2012 to December 2023, a total of 7879 patients who underwent breast surgery for clinical T1\u20132/N0 cancers and SLN biopsy with or without axillary lymph node dissection were included. Preoperative axillary US and MRI findings were compared with clinical-pathologic variables, considering the presence of SLN metastasis. Patients with positive results routinely underwent US-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and negative FNAB results were also considered. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with SLN metastasis.\n Results:\n A total of 7879 eligible patients (47.48% with clinical T1 cancer and 52.52% with T2 cancer) were included in our study. Among them, 2048 (25.99%) had positive SLN biopsy, and 1971 (25.02%) underwent axillary lymph node dissection due to positive SLN biopsy. Patients with SLN metastasis were younger and had a higher frequency of positive axillary findings on US and MRI, as well as clinical T2 stage (P<0.05). At multivariate analysis, positive axilla at US (P =0.001), positive axilla at MRI (P =0.02), clinical T2 stage (P =0.004), grade 3 (P =0.004) and lymphovascular invasion (P=0.001) were significantly associated with SLN metastasis. The number of nodal metastases increase with increasing tumor size. Among 3595 (45.06%) patients with negative axilla at US and MRI and clinical T1 stage cancer, 698 (8.75%) had SLN metastasis. For these people, the median follow-up was 73.6 months. The estimated 5-year invasive disease\u2013free survival rate was 96.8%, while the 5-year overall survival rate was 98.6%. The analysis of the first primary-outcome events (occurrence or recurrence of invasive disease or death from any cause), showed apparent differences between the positive axilla at US and MRI and clinical T1 stage cancer group and negative axilla at US and MRI and clinical T1 stage cancer group in the incidence of recurrence (4.7% vs. 3.2%) and death (2.0% vs. 1.4%).\n Conclusions:\n Preoperative axillary US and MRI results, along with clinical T stage are significant predictors of SLN metastasis in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The results of this study suggest that preoperative axillary US and MRI can help select patients at minimal risk of SLN metastasis, for whom axillary surgery could be omitted.\n",

The TRAIN-3 study previously showed that one in three patients with hormone receptor negative (HR-) tumors and one in six with hormone receptor positive (HR+) tumors have an early pathologic complete response (pCR) after only three cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we present the results of the primary endpoint, 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Methods TRAIN-3 is a single-arm, phase 2 study in 43 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with stage II\u2013III HER2-positive breast cancer received up to nine cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz) and were referred for surgery once a complete radiologic response was seen on MRI. Locoregional and endocrine treatment followed national guidelines. Patients with a pCR completed one year of trastuzumab and pertuzumab as adjuvant treatment. Patients with residual invasive disease completed the 9 cycles of PTC-Ptz followed by 14 cycles of T-DM1. EFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier statistics on an intention-to-treat basis for each HR subgroup separately. Three-year EFS rates of 88% for HR- and 90% for HR+ tumors were taken as reference. The study would be declared successful if no more than 38 events in the HR- subgroup and 34 events in the HR+ subgroup occurred after 700 patient years of follow-up. Results 235 patients with HR- tumors received 1-3 (n=91, 38.7%), 4-6 (n=76, 32.3%) or 7-9 (n=68, 28.9%) cycles of PTC-Ptz. 232 patients with HR+ tumors received 1-3 (n=69, 29.7%), 4-6 (n=71, 30.6%) or 7-9 (n=92, 39.7%) cycles of PTC-Ptz. After a median follow-up of 39.7 months (IQR 34.8-45.4), 3-year EFS was 92.1% (95% CI 88.5-95.8) in the HR- subgroup and 92.0% (95% CI 88.5-95.6) in the HR+ subgroup. A total of 19 and 21 events were reported in patients with HR- and HR+ tumors respectively, meeting the primary endpoint. Events included 9 vs 8 distant recurrences, 7 vs 6 locoregional recurrences, 2 vs 4 non-breast second primary malignancies, 0 vs 3 second primary breast tumors, and 1 vs 0 non-breast cancer related death, in HR- and HR+ patients respectively. EFS rates in patients treated with 1-3 cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy were 96.0% (95% CI 91.6-100) in HR- and 97.1% (95% CI 93.3-100) in HR+ patients. Corresponding figures were 90.8% (95% CI 84.5-97.5) and 92.8% (95% CI 87.0-99.1) in patients treated with 4-6 cycles and 87.6% (95% CI 79.1-97.0) and 87.1% (80.3-94.6) in patients treated with 7-9 cycles. Conclusions In patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer, MRI-guided treatment optimization is associated with excellent 3-year EFS. These results confirm our earlier findings on pCR rate that one in three patients with HR- disease and one in six patients with HR+ disease can be treated effectively with only three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This approach offers a novel therapeutic option that provides a significant reduction in toxicity for this patient population.\n Citation Format: Fleur Louis, Anna van der Voort, Mette van Ramshorst, Antonios Daletzakis, Ingrid Mandjes, Inge Kemper, Mariette Agterof, Wim van der Steeg, Joan Heijns, Marlies van Bekkum, Ester Siemerink, Philomeen Kuijer, Astrid Scholten, Jelle Wesseling, Marie-Jeanne Vrancken Peeters, Ritse Mann, Gabe Sonke.

The current standard of care for early-stage TNBC is neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by pembrolizumab monotherapy after surgery (KEYNOTE-522), however prior to this treatment options and outcomes have been relatively limited compared to hormone receptor- and HER2- positive breast cancers. This study aimed to describe the treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of early-stage and locally advanced TNBC patients in England before the approval of KEYNOTE-522. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, data from the English National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service databases (Cancer Registry, Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy, Hospital Episode Statistics [HES], National Radiotherapy Dataset and Diagnostic Imaging Dataset) were used. Adults with a first record of primary early-stage or locally advanced TNBC (stage II \u2013 IIIb) between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2018 were indexed. Treatment pathways and clinical outcomes were investigated over a maximum of 5-years follow-up period extending to December 2020. Outcomes were described descriptively. Results: A total of 3,475 patients met the inclusion criteria for the newly diagnosed TNBC cohort. 82.7% and 17.3% of patients were diagnosed at stage II and stage III respectively and, 83.3% were of white ethnicity, and 46.6% were node positive. Around 80% of patients had a primary surgery performed (i.e. a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery). Anthracyclines were the most common drug type used as a first regimen in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. During the follow up period, 37.7% and 15.3% of patients experienced locoregional or distant metastatic progression, respectively and 22.6% died. Median OS or EFS was not reached as < 50% patients died within the 5-year follow up period. The 5-year OS and EFS rate was ~57% and ~60%, respectively. Increased healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) with associated high costs was reported in the time periods post diagnosis. The mean number of TNBC-related inpatient stays was the highest in the 3 to 6 months following index; 3.77 (SD = 3.95), costing a total of \u00a34,992,150.48 (per patient cost: \u00a31,458.84 [\u00a31918.76], mean [SD]). Conclusions: This is the first real world evidence study using the England NCRAS datasets to assess the outcomes of the early-stage and locally advanced TNBC population in England.

As of 2/14/21, 16/80 pts have been enrolled and treated with ipi/nivo/cryo followed by breast surgery and adjuvant nivo. Pts undergo percutaneous, image-guided cryo with concurrent research core biopsy 7-10 days prior to surgery and received ipi (1mg/kg IV) with nivo (240mg IV) 1 to 5 days prior to cryo. After surgery, pts received 3 additional doses of nivo at 240mg IV Q2 weeks.

Adjuvant capecitabine or olaparib is recommended for all patients per local standard-of-care. Patients will be stratified by NAC platinum administration, NAC anthracycline administration, and clinical nodal status (positive versus negative). The primary endpoint is 3-year Event Free Survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints include Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS), Distant Disease-Free Survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.

Baseline image-guided biopsies allowed central pathology evaluation of ITH HER2, defined as an area with HER2 amplification in >5% but < 50% of tumor cells or a HER2-negative area by FISH. The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating inferior pathologic complete response (pCR) measured by Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) in the subset of ITH-HER2 pts. Single-cell ERBB2 FISH analysis identified the fraction of ERBB2 nonamplified cells as a factor associated with therapeutic resistance (Metzger et al. Cancer Discovery 2021). Secondary endpoints included event-free survival (EFS), invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) by ITH-HER2 status and RCB scores.\n Results:\n 163 pts were enrolled and received treatment in the study from Jan 2015 to Jan 2018. Central pathology evaluation of HER2 heterogeneity was successful in 96% (157/163) of cases, with 16 classified as ITH-HER2. RCB-0 or -I rate in the ITH-HER2 vs. not was (25% v. 67%, OR = 5.6, p = 0.002). Median follow-up, including all treated pts (n =163), was 65.4 months (IQR, 60.3-76.6). The 5yr EFS, iDFS, and BCSS were 91% [86.5% - 95.6%], 89.4% [84.5% - 94.5%], and 96% [92.9% - 99.2%], respectively. ITH-HER2 was associated with numerically inferior outcomes for EFS, iDFS, and BCSS (Table 1).\n The subset of pts with non-ITH-HER2 at baseline (n= 141) and RCB-0 or -I (n = 95/141, 67%) had a 5-yr IDFS of 94.2% [89.3% - 99.3%]. A sensitivity analysis describing survival outcomes by chemotherapy use in the adjuvant setting will be presented at the meeting, along with translational research results evaluating the association of HER2DX assay with pCR and survival outcomes.\n Conclusions:\n The inferior pCR rates among cases classified as ITH-HER2 translated into numerically inferior outcomes for both EFS and iDFS. The number of events is small; therefore, our results are exploratory. Selecting pts whose tumors lack ITH-HER2 can increase the chances of achieving RCB 0/I with neoadjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab. Neoadjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab, followed by adjuvant HER2-directed therapy without classic chemotherapy agents, could represent an optimal regimen for non-ITH-HER2 pts experiencing RCB 0/I at the time of surgery and deserves further study.\n Table 1. 5-year survival estimates by ITH-HER2\n Citation Format: Otto Metzger, Se Eun Kim, Nabihah Tayob, Giuseppe Viale, Denise Yardley, Aleix Prat, Vandana Abramson, Laura Spring, Adrienne Waks, Eileen Wrabel, Michelle DeMeo, Aditya Bardia, Patrizia Dell'Orto, Leila Russo, Tari King, Franziska Michor, Eric Winer, Kornelia Polyak, Sara Tolaney, Ian Krop.

A sensitivity analysis describing survival outcomes by chemotherapy use in the adjuvant setting will be presented at the meeting, along with translational research results evaluating the association of HER2DX assay with pCR and survival outcomes.\n Conclusions:\n The inferior pCR rates among cases classified as ITH-HER2 translated into numerically inferior outcomes for both EFS and iDFS. The number of events is small; therefore, our results are exploratory. Selecting pts whose tumors lack ITH-HER2 can increase the chances of achieving RCB 0/I with neoadjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab. Neoadjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab, followed by adjuvant HER2-directed therapy without classic chemotherapy agents, could represent an optimal regimen for non-ITH-HER2 pts experiencing RCB 0/I at the time of surgery and deserves further study.\n Table 1. 5-year survival estimates by ITH-HER2\n Citation Format: Otto Metzger, Se Eun Kim, Nabihah Tayob, Giuseppe Viale, Denise Yardley, Aleix Prat, Vandana Abramson, Laura Spring, Adrienne Waks, Eileen Wrabel, Michelle DeMeo, Aditya Bardia, Patrizia Dell'Orto, Leila Russo, Tari King, Franziska Michor, Eric Winer, Kornelia Polyak, Sara Tolaney, Ian Krop.

Among the various aspects that impact the quality of life of breast cancer patients, sexual well-being and body image in terms of breast satisfaction play a crucial role. Unfortunately, these aspects are often overlooked and undervalued in healthcare, leading to inadequate care and support for breast cancer patients. This study delved into the factors that influence breast satisfaction and sexual well-being in early-stage breast cancer patients who have recently received a cancer diagnosis. We aim to offer providers a more patient-centered and comprehensive approach to breast cancer care. METHODS: This prospective questionnaire-based study screened 175 early-stage breast cancer patients recently diagnosed at a university-affiliated community hospital in Michigan from October 2022 to June 2023. Participants with a previous history of chemoradiation and advanced-stage breast cancer were excluded. Structured telephone interviews were conducted to obtain informed consent and assess patients' breast satisfaction and sexual well-being. Participants were interviewed after their recent breast cancer diagnosis and before undergoing surgical intervention. A validated BREAST-Q questionnaire was used, and their scores were converted to equivalent Rasch scores for interpretation (0=worst, 100=best). Pre-existing medical conditions, social history, and other variables were collected through electronic medical records review and confirmed by interview. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28.0, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 175 patients initially screened, 56 met the selection criteria. 75% (N=42) participated, while 25% (N=14) were excluded as they declined to participate or were unreachable via telephone. 81% were White, 14% were Black, and 5% were Hispanics. The cancer stages of the patients were Stage 0 (29.3%), I (48.8%), II (12.2%), and III (9.8%). The mean breast satisfaction score of participants was 67.1 (N=42), and the mean sexual well-being score was 44.6 (N=36). The study found that only the type of surgery was observed to be significantly related to the breast satisfaction of patients. Interestingly, patients who chose mastectomy had higher breast satisfaction scores (75.6 vs. 62.9, p< 0.05) and were relatively younger (59 years vs. 67 years, p< 0.05) than those undergoing lumpectomy. No other demographic factors (race, education, marital status, BMI), social history (smoking), bra size, or pre-existing medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes) were found to affect breast satisfaction among these patients. On the other hand, age had a negative correlation with sexual well-being (mean age=64 years, p< 0.05), while income had a positive correlation (mean income=$ 76,170 annually, p< 0.05). No other variables were significantly associated with patients\u2019 sexual well-being. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the patient's sexual well-being was significantly associated with age and income, while breast satisfaction was only related to the type of surgery. These findings underscore the importance of considering multiple aspects of a patient's life when designing a comprehensive treatment plan following a cancer diagnosis. By providing additional support and resources tailored to these specific needs, healthcare providers can enhance patients' overall quality of life and promote greater satisfaction with their treatment outcomes.\n Citation Format: Kim Abbegail Aldecoa, Yi Lee, Lisa Deptula, Chioma Mbionwu, Ewomamobuho Eto, Esentur Salamatov, Megan Frame, Andrea Briefs Ferris, Geetha Krishnamoorthy, Amy Kirby, Judie Goodman.

Pembrolizumab (P), an anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody, is approved for early-stage TNBC and metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. However, safety and efficacy of SG+P in early TNBC is not known. We published results of Arm A1 investigating neoadjuvant SG monotherapy in early TNBC (Spring et al. Annals of Onc 2024). Here we present results from Arm A2 of the NeoSTAR study investigating the combination of neoadjuvant SG + P in early-stage TNBC (NCT04230109).\n Methods:\n Patients (pts) with early TNBC (tumor size \u22652 cm or node positive) with no prior treatment were eligible. Pts received SG at starting dose of 10mg/kg on days 1,8 of a 21-day cycle for 4 cycles with P 200 mg given on day 1 of each cycle. After trial regimen, pts underwent imaging to determine residual radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1. A biopsy was performed if residual disease (RD) was suspected. Additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ANACT) was at discretion of the treating physician prior to definitive surgery. The primary objective was rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant SG/P. Secondary objectives included need for ANACT, radiographic response (RR), safety and tolerability (adverse events [AEs] per CTCAE v5.0) and event-free survival. A Simon two-stage design and standard descriptive statistics were utilized, including 95% binomial confidence intervals for all rates estimated.\n Results:\n From 5/19/23-8/13/24, 50 pts were enrolled (median age: 57 years, range 23-77). Clinical anatomic stage was II in 48 pts (96%) and III in 2 pts (4%). 64% of pts were node negative at diagnosis. 44 pts (88%) completed the trial regimen (5 pts had toxicity, 1 pt progressed on treatment). In interim analysis, 5/15 had pCR and so the remaining 35 were enrolled. The pCR rate per protocol (pts with pCR at surgery directly after SG/P without ANCT) was 16/50 (34%, 95% CI 19.5-46.7). The RR rate (complete CR or partial response PR) was 66% (95% CI 50-78%), 30% CR and 36% PR. Of 26 pts who received ANACT, 9 experienced pCR (2 biopsy-confirmed RD, 6 negative or non-diagnostic RD biopsy, 1 no biopsy). Overall, 25 (50%, 95% CI 35.5-64.5) pts had pCR at surgery. Of 5 pts with pathogenic BRCA mutations, 3 (60%) had pCR after SG/P, and 1 pt had pCR after ANACT. 20 pts (40%) had grade 3 or higher AEs. The most common AEs were nausea (28, 56%), alopecia (26, 52%), fatigue (23, 46%), and diarrhea (22, 44%). Dose reductions of SG occurred in 4 pts (8%). Updated survival and biomarker data will be presented at the meeting.\n Conclusions:\n In the first trial to investigate the SG/P combination in early TNBC, 34% of pts had pCR. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal duration and sequence of neoadjuvant SG/P and chemotherapy for pts with TNBC.\n \n Clinical trial information:\n NCT04230109\n \n .\n",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant RT for elderly EBC patients using deep learning (DL) to personalize treatment plans. Five distinct DL models were developed to generate personalized treatment recommendations. Patients whose actual treatments aligned with the DL model suggestions were classified into the Consistent group, while those with divergent treatments were placed in the Inconsistent group. The efficacy of these models was assessed by comparing outcomes between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression and Poisson regression analyses were used to visualize and quantify the influence of various features on adjuvant RT selection. In a cohort of 8,047 elderly EBC patients, treatment following the Deep Survival Regression with Mixture Effects (DSME) model's recommendations significantly improved survival, with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted benefits, including a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.86), a risk difference of 4.63% (95% CI, 1.59-7.66), and an extended mean survival time of 8.96 months (95% CI, 6.85-10.97), outperforming other models and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The DSME model identified elderly patients with larger tumors and more advanced disease stages as ideal candidates for adjuvant RT, though no benefit was seen in patients not recommended for it. This study introduces a novel DL-guided approach for selecting adjuvant RT in elderly EBC patients, enhancing treatment precision and potentially improving survival outcomes while minimizing unnecessary interventions.",

We compared the clinical end points of patients with breast cancer treated preoperatively with systemic therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) and of those treated postoperatively with the same regimen (adjuvant therapy) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated nine randomized studies, including a total of 3946 patients with breast cancer, that compared neoadjuvant therapy with adjuvant therapy regardless of what additional surgery and/or radiation treatment was used. Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06). However, neoadjuvant therapy was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of loco-regional disease recurrences (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.43), compared with adjuvant therapy, especially in trials where more patients in the neoadjuvant, than the adjuvant, arm received radiation therapy without surgery (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.10). Across trials, we observed heterogeneity in the rates of complete clinical response (range = 7%-65%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), pathologic response (range = 4%-29%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), and adoption of conservative local treatment (range = 28%-89% in neoadjuvant arms, P for heterogeneity of <.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeoadjuvant therapy was apparently equivalent to adjuvant therapy in terms of survival and overall disease progression. Neoadjuvant therapy, compared with adjuvant therapy, was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of loco-regional recurrence when radiotherapy without surgery was adopted.",

Since the early 1980s, the role of preoperative chemotherapy in early stage (or operable) breast cancer has been the subject of study. Potential advantages are early introduction of systemic therapy, determination of chemosensitivity, reduction of tumour volume and downstaging of surgical requirement. Concerns exist about local control after downsized surgery and the delay of local treatment in patients with tumours resistant to chemotherapy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy in women with operable breast cancer when compared to postoperative chemotherapy.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Specialised Register maintained by the Editorial Base of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 4th of August 2005.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials comparing preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative in women with operable breast cancer.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nStudies were assessed for eligibility and quality, and data were extracted by two independent review authors. Hazard ratios were derived for time-to-event outcomes directly or indirectly using the methods described by Parmar. Relative risks were derived for dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed effect model.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 14 eligible studies which randomised a total of 5,500 women. Median follow-up ranged from 18 to 124 months. Eight studies described a satisfactory method of randomisation.Data, based on 1139 estimated deaths in 4620 women available for analysis, show equivalent overall survival rates with a HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.09; p, 0.67; no heterogeneity). Preoperative chemotherapy increases breast conservation rates, yet at the associated cost of increased loco regional recurrence rates. However, this rate was not increased as long as surgery remains part of the treatment even after complete tumour regression (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.37; p, 0.25; no heterogeneity. Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with fewer adverse effects. Pathological complete response is associated with better survival than residual disease (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.69; p, < 10-4).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis review suggests safe application of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer in order to down-stage surgical requirement, to evaluate chemosensitivity and to facilitate translational research."

The possibility of reduction in size, even in some cases complete clinical and mammographic regression, can make the localization of the tumor bed difficult at the time of surgery. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience about the utility of US-guided implantation of a metallic marker in patients with breast cancer before induction chemotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nForty-three patients with 44 masses were diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy of breast carcinoma. Before beginning of the induction chemotherapy all of them were referred for metallic marker placement. A metallic harpoon was placed under US guidance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne patient died during the chemotherapy. Six underwent mastectomy, and 9 still had a palpable tumor at the time of surgery. In the remaining 27 patients (with 28 lesions) pre-operative wire localization of the tumor bed was carried out: in 11 cases the harpoon was necessary for the localization of the tumor bed, in 6 the harpoon was useful, and in 11 patients the localization of the tumor could have been done without the marker. No complications were observed and the marker remained stable in all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients who undergo induction chemotherapy, the placement of a metallic harpoon under US guidance is a safe, simple and inexpensive technique for localization of the tumor bed previous to conservative surgery.",

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed in patients with locally advanced breast cancer submitted to breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on an adriamycin-cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel regimen. We evaluated the clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemistry, and surgical factors that contribute to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and locoregional recurrence. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox model were used to evaluate the main factors related to disease-free survival. RESULTS: Of the 449 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 98 underwent breast-conserving surgery. The average diameter of the tumors was 5.3 cm, and 87.2% reached a size of up to 3 cm. Moreover, 86.7% were classified as clinical stage III, 74.5% had T3-T4 tumors, 80.5% had N1-N2 axilla, and 89.8% had invasive ductal carcinoma. A pathologic complete response was observed in 27.6% of the tumors, and 100.0% of samples had free margins. The 5-year actuarial overall survival rate was 81.2%, and the mean follow-up was 72.8 months. The rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and locoregional recurrence were 11.2% and 15.3%, respectively. Multifocal morphology response was the only factor related to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence disease-free survival (p=0.04). A multivariate analysis showed that the pathologic response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)-breast cutoff was the only factor related to locoregional recurrence disease-free survival (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Breast-conserving surgery is a safe and effective therapy for selected locally advanced breast tumors.",

Neoadjuvant trials have recently become popular as they offer several advantages compared to traditional adjuvant trials. Studies have shown that patients who achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment have a better long-term outcome. Consequently, increasing the rate of pCR became the end point of neoadjuvant trials with the expectation of translation into improved survival. However, the definition of pCR has lacked uniformity, and the prognostic impact of achievement of pCR on survival in different breast cancer subtypes is uncertain. In this review, we present the controversies associated with the use of pCR as an end point in neoadjuvant trials.",

The distance of each clip from the position of the target calcification was assessed using stereotactic coordinates in 52 sequential cases and was measured on mammograms before and after biopsy in 108 clips deployed through an 11-gauge probe and 98 clips deployed using an 18-gauge needle. Variance in clip position between postbiopsy and follow-up mammograms was measured in 43 clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and in 44 clips placed with an 18-gauge needle. Comparable measurements of variance in position of fat necrosis calcifications between screening mammograms were used as controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-seven percent of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 98% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications using stereotactic coordinates. On mammograms obtained after biopsy, 70% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 63% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications, and the position of 91% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 90% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle varied less than 15 mm on follow-up mammograms. Both clips provided accurate targets for wire-localized excisions. The cost of the 11-gauge needle and clip is $320. The 14-gauge probe, vascular clip, and 18-gauge spinal needle cost $191.58.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA vascular ligating clip delivered to a stereotactic core biopsy site by an 18-gauge spinal needle is comparable in apparent accuracy and stability to a clip deployed through an 11-gauge probe. This technique allows core biopsies to be performed with instruments smaller than 11-gauge and at a 40% savings in equipment cost."

However, accurately locating the tumor during a lumpectomy, especially when the lesion is small and nonpalpable, is a challenge. Such difficulty can lead to either incomplete tumor removal or prolonged surgical time, which result in high re-operation rates (~25%) and increased surgical costs. Here, we report a fiber optoacoustic guide (FOG) with augmented reality (AR) for sub-millimeter tumor localization and intuitive surgical guidance with minimal interference. The FOG is preoperatively implanted in the tumor. Under external pulsed light excitation, the FOG omnidirectionally broadcasts acoustic waves through the optoacoustic effect by a specially designed nano-composite layer at its tip. By capturing the acoustic wave, three ultrasound sensors on the breast skin triangulate the FOG tip\u2019s position with 0.25-mm accuracy. An AR system with a tablet measures the coordinates of the ultrasound sensors and transforms the FOG tip\u2019s position into visual feedback with <1-mm accuracy, thus aiding surgeons in directly visualizing the tumor location and performing fast and accurate tumor removal. We further show the use of a head-mounted display to visualize the same information in the surgeons\u2019 first-person view and achieve hands-free guidance. Towards clinical application, a surgeon successfully deployed the FOG to excise a \u201cpseudo tumor\u201d in a female human cadaver. With the high-accuracy tumor localization by FOG and the intuitive surgical guidance by AR, the surgeon performed accurate and fast tumor removal, which will significantly reduce re-operation rates and shorten the surgery time. Implanting an optoacoustic beacon into breast tumors provides surgeons with sub-millimeter localization accuracy when performing surgery. The system has been developed by Lu Lan from Boston University and coworkers. A fiber optoacoustic guide(FOG) which has a fiber tip coated with ZnO nanoparticles and graphite so that it is strongly light absorbing is implanted into the tumor prior to surgery. When exposed to pulsed light excitation the tip generates omnidirectional ultrasound waves due to the optoacoustic effect. The use of three ultrasound sensors to collect this signal makes it possible to accurately triangulate the exact location of the tumor during surgery. Combining the FOG with an augmented reality system offers surgeons an intuitive guidance aid which not only allows accurate and rapid tumor removal but will also help reduce the need for re-operation.",

After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001).

Methods A total of 1851 women for whom followup data were available and nodal status was known underwent randomly assigned treatment consisting of total mastectomy, lumpectomy alone, or lumpectomy and breast irradiation. Kaplan\u2013Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of the outcome were obtained. Results The cumulative incidence of recurrent tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 14.3 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy and breast irradiation, as compared with 39.2 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy without irradiation (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease\u2013free survival, or overall survival. The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy alone, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.23; P=0.51). The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.14; P=0.74). Among the lumpectomy-treated women whose surgical specimens had tumor-free margins, the hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent postoperative breast irradiation, as compared with those who did not, was 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.06; P=0.23). Radiation therapy was associated with a marginally significant decrease in deaths due to breast cancer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deaths from other causes. Conclusions Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.

Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (Yamamoto et al., 2011)(Kuhl, 2008)(Sardanelli et al., 2004)(13)(Sardanelli et al., 2007). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2009)(Pons et al., 2014).",

Off-site reviewers aware of the entry criterion (planned mastectomy) evaluated both examinations for the presence of malignant foci, recording the density pattern on mammography. The gold standard was pathologic examination of the whole excised breast (slice thickness, 5 mm).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 99 breasts, pathologic findings revealed 52 unifocal, 29 multifocal, and 18 multicentric cancers for a total of 188 malignant foci (158 invasive and 30 in situ).

                    "[466753 | Kuhl | 2008 | Citations: 41]": "THE STUDY BY BERG AND COLLEAUGES 1 PUBLISHED IN this issue of JAMA addresses important clinical questions: What is the additional cancer diagnosis yield of screening ultrasound in women at increased risk of breast cancer, and what are the \u201ccosts\u201d of such strategies in terms of false-positive diagnoses. The design of this American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) trial, from the multi-institutional setting to source documentation and independent data analysis, is excellent from every aspect. This study and several other previously published trials demonstrate how important it is to have institutions like ACRIN sponsor and help organize prospective clinical trials that follow good clinical practice in the world of diagnostic imaging, which, unlike clinical research in the therapeutic sector, has to proceed without the financial support and scientific infrastructure usually provided by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The results of this study are impressive. Ultrasound was associated with a 55% increase in diagnosing breast cancer compared with mammography alone: a 7.6 per 1000 to 11.8 per 1000. The sensitivity with which breast cancer was detected was 77.5% (32 of 41) for the combined use of ultrasound and mammography vs 49% (20 of 41) for mammography alone. Given that mammography is the standard of care, one could argue that a main finding of this study is the apparently limited sensitivity of screening mammography. However, this finding is in keeping with recent results of several mammographic screening studies. Depending on the composition of the screening cohort, the sensitivity can be as low as 25% for BRCA1 mutation carriers, but even in women at average risk, for instance in almost 50 000 women who participated in theDigitalMammographic ImagingScreening trial, theoverall sensitivity of screening mammography was only 55%. It is well established that mammography and ultrasound are complementary for diagnosing breast cancer. Ultrasound performs best in cases for which mammography performs weakest, ie, in breast areas with of dense fibroglandular tissue. Yet, breast ultrasound is seldom used for screening in the United States, and to date, none of the worldwide screening programs offers ultrasound. Reservations against the use of ultrasound include costs, frequency of falsepositive findings, and lack of evidence from randomized trials on mortality end points. The results from this study by Berg and colleagues confirm that the positive predictive value of screening ultrasound is indeed low. Of 233 women for whom biopsy was recommended based on a suspicious ultrasound finding, only 20 (8.6%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Stated otherwise, 91.4% of all suspicious ultrasound findings identified by expert breast radiologists were due to benign changes. Although this seems to be a key argument against the use of breast ultrasound, one should consider that mammography, the accepted standard of care for screening, had a positive predictive value of 14.7% (20 of 136) in the same cohort. In the cohort of 2712 women, the number of falsepositive diagnoses increased from 116 (for mammography alone) to 275 (for the combined use of mammography and ultrasound). This might be considered far too many. But this has to be weighted against the benefit of the additional cancer diagnosis yield of ultrasound. Twelve cancers, ie, 29% of the total 41 cancers, were only detected by ultrasound. Whether this is sufficient to justify the many false-positive ultrasound diagnoses is something every individual woman may have to decide for herself. Of note, comparing only numbers of false-positive diagnoses may not be fair because a suspicious finding made by mammography usually requires stereotactic, mostly vacuumassisted biopsy, an expensive and time-consuming procedure. In comparison, a positive ultrasound finding can be investigated by ultrasound-guided core biopsy (or even fineneedle aspiration), a simple, fast, and inexpensive procedure that often may be performed immediately. Accordingly, the average false-positive ultrasound may not have the same implications as the average false-positive mammographic diagnosis. This statement should not downplay the problem. Falsepositive diagnoses should be avoided not only because they add to the overall costs of a screening program but also because they may stimulate unnecessary anxieties. However, a recent study on the psychological impact of false-positive screening diagnoses concluded that \u201cwomen who are re-"

Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (Yamamoto et al., 2011)(Kuhl, 2008)(Sardanelli et al., 2004)(13)(Sardanelli et al., 2007). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2009)(Pons et al., 2014)."

After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001). The crude cumulative incidence of these events was 8.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, after 20 years. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of contralateral-breast carcinomas, distant metastases, or second primary cancers. After a median follow-up of 20 years, the rate of death from all causes was 41.7 percent in the group that underwent breast-conserving surgery and 41.2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group (P=1.0).

We have analyzed the patterns of failure in each arm of the trial and the prognostic factors that have an independent effect on treatment failures and overall survival.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe trial included 179 patients with breast cancer of up to 20 mm in diameter at macroscopic examination. Eighty-eight patients had conservative management and 91 a mastectomy. All patients had axillary dissection with frozen-section examination. For patients with positive axillary nodes (N+), a second randomization was performed: lymph node irradiation versus no further regional treatment. Patterns of failure were determined by a competing-risk approach and multivariate analysis. A prognostic-score was determined by multivariate analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall survival, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, new primary malignancy, and locoregional recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two surgical groups, or between lymph node irradiation groups. Most recurrences appeared during the first 10 years. Three distinct prognostic groups were determined taking into account age, tumor size, histologic grading, and number of positive axillary nodes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLong-term results support conservative treatment with limited surgery and systematic breast irradiation as a safe procedure for the management of small breast cancers. Four easily obtainable clinical and histologic factors may be combined in a prognostic score that is highly predictive of overall and event-free survival.",

Methods A total of 1851 women for whom followup data were available and nodal status was known underwent randomly assigned treatment consisting of total mastectomy, lumpectomy alone, or lumpectomy and breast irradiation. Kaplan\u2013Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of the outcome were obtained. Results The cumulative incidence of recurrent tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 14.3 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy and breast irradiation, as compared with 39.2 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy without irradiation (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease\u2013free survival, or overall survival. The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy alone, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.23; P=0.51). The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.14; P=0.74). Among the lumpectomy-treated women whose surgical specimens had tumor-free margins, the hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent postoperative breast irradiation, as compared with those who did not, was 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.06; P=0.23). Radiation therapy was associated with a marginally significant decrease in deaths due to breast cancer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deaths from other causes. Conclusions Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.

Respondents were asked to select one member of their practice to complete the survey. A total of 754 surveys were completed. Every respondent did not reply to every question.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContrast-enhanced breast MRI was offered at 557 of 754 (73.8%) practices.

Radiologists qualified under the Mammography Quality Standards Act supervised the performance of and interpreted breast MRI in the majority of facilities. Of 552 respondents, breast MRI was interpreted as soft copy with computer-aided detection (CAD) in 280 practices (50.7%), as soft copy without CAD in 261 (47.3%), and as hard copy in 11 (2.0%).

(LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nBreast cancer surgical approaches have evolved significantly with the integration of image-guided techniques that enhance precision and improve outcomes. Image-guided surgery utilizes various imaging modalities to locate and characterize breast lesions before and during surgical procedures, allowing for more accurate tumor removal while preserving healthy breast tissue. This approach has become increasingly important as breast conservation therapy (BCT) has become the standard of care for many patients, replacing more radical procedures like mastectomy when appropriate. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe effectiveness of image-guided surgery depends significantly on breast cancer stage, as tumor characteristics, extent of disease, and treatment goals differ between early and advanced stages. In early-stage breast cancer (Stages 0-II), image guidance primarily focuses on precise localization of smaller tumors for breast-conserving surgery, with emphasis on negative margins and minimal tissue removal. For advanced-stage disease (Stages III-IV), image guidance often supports more extensive surgical approaches, helps assess treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy, and aids in managing metastatic disease. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nDifferent imaging modalities offer varying benefits for surgical guidance based on tumor stage, size, and location. These include ultrasound, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and newer molecular imaging techniques, each with specific advantages for different clinical scenarios. The selection of appropriate imaging modality is critical for optimizing surgical outcomes while minimizing complications and improving cosmetic results. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

This highlights a critical need for effective image guidance during surgery to optimize resection margins in real time.\n\nUltrasound has emerged as a particularly valuable intraoperative guidance tool for early-stage breast cancer. The traditional \"blind\" approach of palpation-guided surgery has proven highly inaccurate, with studies reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients <Paper corpusId=\"273711953\" paperTitle=\"(Abdelmalik et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Ultrasound-guided surgery offers a more precise alternative, especially for nonpalpable breast cancers, potentially reducing positive margin rates and subsequent re-operations.\n\nBeyond ultrasound, other image-guided approaches show promise for early-stage disease. Thermal ablative techniques, including ultrasound or MRI-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation, are emerging as effective alternatives for treating small, early-stage breast cancers <Paper corpusId=\"249903023\" paperTitle=\"(Newbury et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This modality offers several advantages including significant tissue penetration, real-time visualization capabilities, and no ionizing radiation exposure <Paper corpusId=\"246434451\" paperTitle=\"(Goto et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These emerging technologies address one of the most significant unmet needs in early-stage breast cancer management: accurate intraoperative imaging for precise tumor localization and margin assessment.\n\nThe effectiveness of image-guided surgery in early-stage breast cancer is particularly important because early detection and treatment lead to significantly better outcomes than when cancer is diagnosed at advanced stages with clinical symptoms <Paper corpusId=\"37526149\" paperTitle=\"(Warrier et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "A BSTRACT Background In 1976, we initiated a randomized trial to determine whether lumpectomy with or without radiation therapy was as effective as total mastectomy for the treatment of invasive breast cancer. Methods A total of 1851 women for whom followup data were available and nodal status was known underwent randomly assigned treatment consisting of total mastectomy, lumpectomy alone, or lumpectomy and breast irradiation. Kaplan\u2013Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of the outcome were obtained. Results The cumulative incidence of recurrent tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 14.3 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy and breast irradiation, as compared with 39.2 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy without irradiation (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease\u2013free survival, or overall survival. The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy alone, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.23; P=0.51). The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.14; P=0.74). Among the lumpectomy-treated women whose surgical specimens had tumor-free margins, the hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent postoperative breast irradiation, as compared with those who did not, was 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.06; P=0.23). Radiation therapy was associated with a marginally significant decrease in deaths due to breast cancer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deaths from other causes. Conclusions Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.

                            "BACKGROUND\nWe conducted 20 years of follow-up of women enrolled in a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of radical (Halsted) mastectomy with that of breast-conserving surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom 1973 to 1980, 701 women with breast cancers measuring no more than 2 cm in diameter were randomly assigned to undergo radical mastectomy (349 patients) or breast-conserving surgery (quadrantectomy) followed by radiotherapy to the ipsilateral mammary tissue (352 patients). After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001). The crude cumulative incidence of these events was 8.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, after 20 years. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of contralateral-breast carcinomas, distant metastases, or second primary cancers. After a median follow-up of 20 years, the rate of death from all causes was 41.7 percent in the group that underwent breast-conserving surgery and 41.2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group (P=1.0). The respective rates of death from breast cancer were 26.1 percent and 24.3 percent (P=0.8).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe long-term survival rate among women who undergo breast-conserving surgery is the same as that among women who undergo radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery is therefore the treatment of choice for women with relatively small breast cancers."

We have analyzed the patterns of failure in each arm of the trial and the prognostic factors that have an independent effect on treatment failures and overall survival.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe trial included 179 patients with breast cancer of up to 20 mm in diameter at macroscopic examination. Eighty-eight patients had conservative management and 91 a mastectomy. All patients had axillary dissection with frozen-section examination. For patients with positive axillary nodes (N+), a second randomization was performed: lymph node irradiation versus no further regional treatment. Patterns of failure were determined by a competing-risk approach and multivariate analysis. A prognostic-score was determined by multivariate analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall survival, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, new primary malignancy, and locoregional recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two surgical groups, or between lymph node irradiation groups. Most recurrences appeared during the first 10 years. Three distinct prognostic groups were determined taking into account age, tumor size, histologic grading, and number of positive axillary nodes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLong-term results support conservative treatment with limited surgery and systematic breast irradiation as a safe procedure for the management of small breast cancers. Four easily obtainable clinical and histologic factors may be combined in a prognostic score that is highly predictive of overall and event-free survival."

                            "Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gained wide acceptance as the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer. One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat 'blind' approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer."

                "text": "\nFor advanced-stage breast cancer (typically stages III-IV), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has become a cornerstone treatment approach, significantly influencing the role of image-guided surgery. NACT is increasingly used in both locally advanced and early-stage breast cancer, with the goal of reducing tumor burden before surgical intervention. <Paper corpusId=\"233026782\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13466998\" paperTitle=\"(Mauri et al., 2005)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9456579\" paperTitle=\"(Hage et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe primary advantage of NACT in advanced disease is its ability to downstage tumors, potentially converting cases that would require mastectomy into candidates for breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This approach allows for locoregional disease removal with clear margins while maintaining acceptable cosmetic outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"237606005\" paperTitle=\"(Dhamija et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2253139\" paperTitle=\"(Carrara et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nA unique challenge in image-guided surgery for advanced breast cancer after NACT is accurate localization of the tumor site when treatment achieves complete clinical and radiological resolution of the disease. This scenario presents a surgical paradox: the better the response to NACT, the more difficult it becomes to precisely locate the original tumor bed during surgery. <Paper corpusId=\"237606005\" paperTitle=\"(Dhamija et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31582363\" paperTitle=\"(Pennisi et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nTo address this challenge, various innovative image-guided marker placement techniques have been developed. These include skin tattooing, radio-opaque tumor marker placement (custom-made clips using angiographic wire or commercially available marker clips), radioactive seed implantation (I-125), Magseeds, and radiofrequency identification devices. <Paper corpusId=\"237606005\" paperTitle=\"(Dhamija et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"38777460\" paperTitle=\"(Margolin et al., 2003)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21256004\" paperTitle=\"(Alonso-Bartolome et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nStudies have demonstrated that placement of tumor marker clips improves locoregional disease control regardless of tumor stage, with reduced local recurrence rates compared to surgery without marker placement. This is particularly important in advanced disease where accurate targeting of the tumor bed is essential for complete tumor removal, even when the tumor has completely responded to NACT. <Paper corpusId=\"237606005\" paperTitle=\"(Dhamija et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nImaging plays a fundamental role throughout the treatment process for advanced breast cancer. Beyond surgical guidance, imaging is crucial for initial staging, monitoring response to NACT, and aiding surgical planning to avoid overtreatment. Comprehensive imaging evaluation combines physical examination with mammography and ultrasound as a valuable noninvasive approach for assessing tumor response. <Paper corpusId=\"257201237\" paperTitle=\"(Conti et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"32625817\" paperTitle=\"(2008)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nDespite advances in treatment approaches for advanced breast cancer, challenges remain. Insufficient therapeutic efficacy during radiotherapy is common in advanced breast cancer patients, highlighting the need for continued improvement in both imaging techniques and treatment strategies. <Paper corpusId=\"246865713\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe pathological response of tumors to NACT appears to correlate with outcomes in advanced disease. The advantage of this approach extends beyond increasing breast-conserving surgery rates, as it enables direct in vivo assessment of treatment response, providing valuable prognostic information. This makes accurate imaging assessment of tumor response crucial for both surgical planning and predicting long-term outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"32625817\" paperTitle=\"(2008)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "BACKGROUND\nInterest in the use of preoperative systemic treatment in the management of breast cancer has increased because such neoadjuvant therapy appears to reduce the extent of local surgery required. We compared the clinical end points of patients with breast cancer treated preoperatively with systemic therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) and of those treated postoperatively with the same regimen (adjuvant therapy) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated nine randomized studies, including a total of 3946 patients with breast cancer, that compared neoadjuvant therapy with adjuvant therapy regardless of what additional surgery and/or radiation treatment was used. Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06). However, neoadjuvant therapy was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of loco-regional disease recurrences (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.43), compared with adjuvant therapy, especially in trials where more patients in the neoadjuvant, than the adjuvant, arm received radiation therapy without surgery (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.10). Across trials, we observed heterogeneity in the rates of complete clinical response (range = 7%-65%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), pathologic response (range = 4%-29%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), and adoption of conservative local treatment (range = 28%-89% in neoadjuvant arms, P for heterogeneity of <.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeoadjuvant therapy was apparently equivalent to adjuvant therapy in terms of survival and overall disease progression. Neoadjuvant therapy, compared with adjuvant therapy, was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of loco-regional recurrence when radiotherapy without surgery was adopted."

                            "BACKGROUND\nCurrently, preoperative chemotherapy is the standard of care in locally advanced breast cancer to achieve local tumour downsizing in order to make surgery possible. Since the early 1980s, the role of preoperative chemotherapy in early stage (or operable) breast cancer has been the subject of study. Potential advantages are early introduction of systemic therapy, determination of chemosensitivity, reduction of tumour volume and downstaging of surgical requirement. Concerns exist about local control after downsized surgery and the delay of local treatment in patients with tumours resistant to chemotherapy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy in women with operable breast cancer when compared to postoperative chemotherapy.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Specialised Register maintained by the Editorial Base of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 4th of August 2005.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials comparing preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative in women with operable breast cancer.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nStudies were assessed for eligibility and quality, and data were extracted by two independent review authors. Hazard ratios were derived for time-to-event outcomes directly or indirectly using the methods described by Parmar. Relative risks were derived for dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed effect model.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 14 eligible studies which randomised a total of 5,500 women. Median follow-up ranged from 18 to 124 months. Eight studies described a satisfactory method of randomisation.Data, based on 1139 estimated deaths in 4620 women available for analysis, show equivalent overall survival rates with a HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.09; p, 0.67; no heterogeneity). Preoperative chemotherapy increases breast conservation rates, yet at the associated cost of increased loco regional recurrence rates. However, this rate was not increased as long as surgery remains part of the treatment even after complete tumour regression (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.37; p, 0.25; no heterogeneity. Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with fewer adverse effects. Pathological complete response is associated with better survival than residual disease (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.69; p, < 10-4).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis review suggests safe application of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer in order to down-stage surgical requirement, to evaluate chemosensitivity and to facilitate translational research."

                            "BCS is increasingly being performed for patients with small tumor to breast volume ratio allowing locoregional disease removal with clear margins and good cosmesis. NACT reduces the tumor burden in locally advanced breast cancer rendering BCS possible rather than mastectomy. (Carrara et al., 2017) In many of these patients, NACT achieves complete resolution of clinically palpable mass and radiological abnormality before surgery. There is a need to accurately localize the tumor site at the time of surgical excision to establish complete pathological response. (Baron et al., 2000)(Pennisi et al., 2016) Various innovative techniques like skin tattooing, imaging-guided radio-opaque tumor marker placement ranging from custom made clips using angiographic wire, commercially available marker clips to radioactive seed (I-125), Magseeds, and radiofrequency identification have been described. (Baron et al., 2000)(Margolin et al., 2003)(Espinosa-Bravo et al., 2011)(Alonso-Bartolom\u00e9 et al., 2002)(Braeuning et al., 2000)(Zhang et al., 2017)(Hayes, 2017) Placement of tumor marker clips improves the locoregional disease control irrespective of the tumor stage with reduced incidence of local recurrence as compared with those who undergo surgery without marker placement. 24"

                            "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast-conserving surgery for locally advanced breast cancer. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed in patients with locally advanced breast cancer submitted to breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on an adriamycin-cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel regimen. We evaluated the clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemistry, and surgical factors that contribute to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and locoregional recurrence. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox model were used to evaluate the main factors related to disease-free survival. RESULTS: Of the 449 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 98 underwent breast-conserving surgery. The average diameter of the tumors was 5.3 cm, and 87.2% reached a size of up to 3 cm. Moreover, 86.7% were classified as clinical stage III, 74.5% had T3-T4 tumors, 80.5% had N1-N2 axilla, and 89.8% had invasive ductal carcinoma. A pathologic complete response was observed in 27.6% of the tumors, and 100.0% of samples had free margins. The 5-year actuarial overall survival rate was 81.2%, and the mean follow-up was 72.8 months. The rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and locoregional recurrence were 11.2% and 15.3%, respectively. Multifocal morphology response was the only factor related to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence disease-free survival (p=0.04). A multivariate analysis showed that the pathologic response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)-breast cutoff was the only factor related to locoregional recurrence disease-free survival (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Breast-conserving surgery is a safe and effective therapy for selected locally advanced breast tumors."

                            "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the different biological subtypes have different prognostic impacts. Neoadjuvant trials have recently become popular as they offer several advantages compared to traditional adjuvant trials. Studies have shown that patients who achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment have a better long-term outcome. Consequently, increasing the rate of pCR became the end point of neoadjuvant trials with the expectation of translation into improved survival. However, the definition of pCR has lacked uniformity, and the prognostic impact of achievement of pCR on survival in different breast cancer subtypes is uncertain. In this review, we present the controversies associated with the use of pCR as an end point in neoadjuvant trials."

                            "OBJECTIVE\nTwo methods of deployment of metallic clips at the site of stereotactic core biopsy for breast calcifications are compared retrospectively.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOne hundred nineteen clips deployed through an 11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy probe at core biopsy sites were compared with 109 vascular ligating clips deployed at biopsy sites using an 18-gauge spinal needle. The distance of each clip from the position of the target calcification was assessed using stereotactic coordinates in 52 sequential cases and was measured on mammograms before and after biopsy in 108 clips deployed through an 11-gauge probe and 98 clips deployed using an 18-gauge needle. Variance in clip position between postbiopsy and follow-up mammograms was measured in 43 clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and in 44 clips placed with an 18-gauge needle. Comparable measurements of variance in position of fat necrosis calcifications between screening mammograms were used as controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-seven percent of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 98% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications using stereotactic coordinates. On mammograms obtained after biopsy, 70% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 63% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications, and the position of 91% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 90% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle varied less than 15 mm on follow-up mammograms. Both clips provided accurate targets for wire-localized excisions. The cost of the 11-gauge needle and clip is $320. The 14-gauge probe, vascular clip, and 18-gauge spinal needle cost $191.58.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA vascular ligating clip delivered to a stereotactic core biopsy site by an 18-gauge spinal needle is comparable in apparent accuracy and stability to a clip deployed through an 11-gauge probe. This technique allows core biopsies to be performed with instruments smaller than 11-gauge and at a 40% savings in equipment cost."

                            "PURPOSE\nInduction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to offer a higher rate of conservative surgery. The possibility of reduction in size, even in some cases complete clinical and mammographic regression, can make the localization of the tumor bed difficult at the time of surgery. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience about the utility of US-guided implantation of a metallic marker in patients with breast cancer before induction chemotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nForty-three patients with 44 masses were diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy of breast carcinoma. Before beginning of the induction chemotherapy all of them were referred for metallic marker placement. A metallic harpoon was placed under US guidance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne patient died during the chemotherapy. Six underwent mastectomy, and 9 still had a palpable tumor at the time of surgery. In the remaining 27 patients (with 28 lesions) pre-operative wire localization of the tumor bed was carried out: in 11 cases the harpoon was necessary for the localization of the tumor bed, in 6 the harpoon was useful, and in 11 patients the localization of the tumor could have been done without the marker. No complications were observed and the marker remained stable in all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients who undergo induction chemotherapy, the placement of a metallic harpoon under US guidance is a safe, simple and inexpensive technique for localization of the tumor bed previous to conservative surgery."

Pathological response of tumours to NC appears to correlate with the outcome. The advantage of NC is that it not only increases breast-conserving surgery, but also enables direct in vivo assessment of response. Breast imaging is used to evaluate the shrinkage of tumour under treatment and to try determine responders. Physical examination associated with mammography and ultrasound is a valuable noninvasive combination for assessing tumour response. At this time, this morphologic evaluation is the only one recognised by the international criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for the"

                            "Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gained wide acceptance as the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer. One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat 'blind' approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer."

                            "Breast MRI and ultrasound are the most popular imaging modalities for the assessment of preoperative stages of breast cancer. Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (Yamamoto et al., 2011)(Kuhl, 2008)(Sardanelli et al., 2004)(13)(Sardanelli et al., 2007). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2009)(Pons et al., 2014)."

Off-site reviewers aware of the entry criterion (planned mastectomy) evaluated both examinations for the presence of malignant foci, recording the density pattern on mammography. The gold standard was pathologic examination of the whole excised breast (slice thickness, 5 mm).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 99 breasts, pathologic findings revealed 52 unifocal, 29 multifocal, and 18 multicentric cancers for a total of 188 malignant foci (158 invasive and 30 in situ). Overall sensitivity was 66% (124/188) for mammography and 81% (152/188) for MRI (p < 0.001); 72% (113/158) and 89% (140/158) for invasive foci (p < 0.001); and 37% (11/30) and 40% (12/30) for in situ foci (p > 0.05, not significant), respectively. Mammography and MRI missed 64 and 36 malignant foci, respectively, with median diameters of 8 and 5 mm (p = 0.033) and an invasive-noninvasive ratio of 2.4:1 (45:19) and 1.0:1 (18:18) (p = 0.043), respectively. The overall positive predictive value (PPV) was 76% (124/164) for mammography and 68% (152/222) for MRI (not significant). In breasts with an almost entirely fatty pattern, sensitivity was 75% for mammography and 80% for MRI (not significant), and the PPV was 73% and 65% (not significant), respectively. In breasts with fibroglandular or dense pattern, the sensitivity was 60% and 81% (p < 0.001), and the PPV was 78% and 71% (not significant), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMRI was more sensitive than mammography for the detection of multiple malignant foci in fibroglandular or dense breasts. Mammography missed larger and more invasive cancer foci than MRI. A relatively low PPV was a problem for both techniques."

CBE, mammography, US, and MR imaging were performed for yearly screening of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, first-degree relatives of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, or women enrolled because of a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer (three or more events in first- or second-degree relatives in either maternal or paternal line; these included breast cancer in women younger than 60 years, ovarian cancer at any age, and male breast cancer at any age).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hundred seventy-eight women (mean age, 46 years +/- 12 [standard deviation]) were enrolled. Breast cancer was found in 11 of 278 women at first round and seven of 99 at second round (14 invasive, four intraductal; eight were <or=10 mm in diameter). Detection rate per year was 4.8% (18 of 377) overall; 4.3% (11 of 258) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers and first-degree relatives of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers versus 5.9% (seven of 119) in women enrolled because of strong family history; and 5.3% (nine of 169) in women with previous personal breast and/or ovarian cancer versus 4.3% (nine of 208) in those without. In six (33%) of 18 patients, cancer was detected only with MR imaging. Sensitivity was as follows: CBE, 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29%, 71%); mammography, 59% (95% CI: 36%, 78%); US, 65% (95% CI: 41%, 83%); and MR imaging, 94% (95% CI: 82%, 99%). Positive predictive value was as follows: CBE, 82% (95% CI: 52%, 95%); mammography, 77% (95% CI: 50%, 92%); US, 65% (95% CI: 41%, 83%); and MR imaging, 63% (95% CI: 43%, 79%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAddition of MR imaging to the screening regimen for high-risk women may enable detection of otherwise unsuspected breast cancers."

                            "THE STUDY BY BERG AND COLLEAUGES 1 PUBLISHED IN this issue of JAMA addresses important clinical questions: What is the additional cancer diagnosis yield of screening ultrasound in women at increased risk of breast cancer, and what are the \"costs\" of such strategies in terms of false-positive diagnoses. The design of this American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) trial, from the multi-institutional setting to source documentation and independent data analysis, is excellent from every aspect. This study and several other previously published trials demonstrate how important it is to have institutions like ACRIN sponsor and help organize prospective clinical trials that follow good clinical practice in the world of diagnostic imaging, which, unlike clinical research in the therapeutic sector, has to proceed without the financial support and scientific infrastructure usually provided by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The results of this study are impressive. Ultrasound was associated with a 55% increase in diagnosing breast cancer compared with mammography alone: a 7.6 per 1000 to 11.8 per 1000. The sensitivity with which breast cancer was detected was 77.5% (32 of 41) for the combined use of ultrasound and mammography vs 49% (20 of 41) for mammography alone. Given that mammography is the standard of care, one could argue that a main finding of this study is the apparently limited sensitivity of screening mammography. However, this finding is in keeping with recent results of several mammographic screening studies. Depending on the composition of the screening cohort, the sensitivity can be as low as 25% for BRCA1 mutation carriers, but even in women at average risk, for instance in almost 50 000 women who participated in theDigitalMammographic ImagingScreening trial, theoverall sensitivity of screening mammography was only 55%. It is well established that mammography and ultrasound are complementary for diagnosing breast cancer. Ultrasound performs best in cases for which mammography performs weakest, ie, in breast areas with of dense fibroglandular tissue. Yet, breast ultrasound is seldom used for screening in the United States, and to date, none of the worldwide screening programs offers ultrasound. Reservations against the use of ultrasound include costs, frequency of falsepositive findings, and lack of evidence from randomized trials on mortality end points. The results from this study by Berg and colleagues confirm that the positive predictive value of screening ultrasound is indeed low. Of 233 women for whom biopsy was recommended based on a suspicious ultrasound finding, only 20 (8.6%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Stated otherwise, 91.4% of all suspicious ultrasound findings identified by expert breast radiologists were due to benign changes. Although this seems to be a key argument against the use of breast ultrasound, one should consider that mammography, the accepted standard of care for screening, had a positive predictive value of 14.7% (20 of 136) in the same cohort. In the cohort of 2712 women, the number of falsepositive diagnoses increased from 116 (for mammography alone) to 275 (for the combined use of mammography and ultrasound). This might be considered far too many. But this has to be weighted against the benefit of the additional cancer diagnosis yield of ultrasound. Twelve cancers, ie, 29% of the total 41 cancers, were only detected by ultrasound. Whether this is sufficient to justify the many false-positive ultrasound diagnoses is something every individual woman may have to decide for herself. Of note, comparing only numbers of false-positive diagnoses may not be fair because a suspicious finding made by mammography usually requires stereotactic, mostly vacuumassisted biopsy, an expensive and time-consuming procedure. In comparison, a positive ultrasound finding can be investigated by ultrasound-guided core biopsy (or even fineneedle aspiration), a simple, fast, and inexpensive procedure that often may be performed immediately. Accordingly, the average false-positive ultrasound may not have the same implications as the average false-positive mammographic diagnosis. This statement should not downplay the problem. Falsepositive diagnoses should be avoided not only because they add to the overall costs of a screening program but also because they may stimulate unnecessary anxieties. However, a recent study on the psychological impact of false-positive screening diagnoses concluded that \"women who are re-"

                            "OBJECTIVE\nIn breast cancer patients eligible for breast-conserving surgery, we evaluated whether the information provided by preoperative MRI of the breast would result in fewer tumor-positive resection margins and fewer reoperations.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nThe study group consisted of 123 consecutive patients diagnosed with either breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ eligible for breast-conserving surgery between April 2007 and July 2010. For these patients, a first plan for breast-conserving surgery was made on the basis of clinical examination and conventional imaging. The final surgical plan was made with knowledge of the preoperative breast MRI. The rates of tumor-positive resection margins and reoperations were compared with those of a historical control group consisting of 119 patients who underwent 123 breast-conserving procedures between January 2005 and December 2006. The percentage of change in the surgical plan was recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPreoperative breast MRI changed the surgical plan to more extensive surgery in 42 patients (34.1%), mainly to mastectomy (29 patients, 23.6%). Ninety-four patients underwent 95 breast-conserving procedures. Significantly fewer patients had tumor-positive resection margins than in the control group (15.8%, 15/95 versus 29.3%, 36/123; p < 0.01). Patients in the study group underwent significantly fewer reoperations compared with the historical control group (18.9%, 18/95 vs 37.4%, 46/123; p < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPreoperative breast MRI can substantially decrease the rate of tumor-positive resection margins and reoperations in breast cancer patients eligible for breast-conserving surgery."

A control group of 174 patients who did not undergo preoperative MRI before breast conservation therapy was matched by age, histopathologic finding, stage, and surgeon. Features compared included breast density, presence of mammographically occult disease, margin status, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, extensive intraductal component, hormone receptor status, and use of adjuvant therapy. Outcomes, including rates of reexcision, ipsilateral recurrence, and disease-free survival, were compared by Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients referred for preoperative breast MRI were more likely to have extremely dense breasts (28% vs 6%, p < 0.0001) and mammographically occult cancer (24% vs 9%, p = 0.0003). The two groups had identical rates of final negative margins, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, extensive intraductal component status, positive hormone receptor results, and systemic adjuvant therapy. Fewer patients in the preoperative MRI group needed reexcision (29% vs 45%, p = 0.02). The median follow-up period after treatment was 8 years. There was no significant difference in locoregional recurrence (p = 0.33) or disease-free survival (p = 0.73) rates between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReexcision rates among patients with early breast cancer undergoing conservation therapy were lower among women who underwent preoperative breast MRI. There was no statistically significant effect of the use of preoperative MRI on rates of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival."

                            "BACKGROUND\nAlthough magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful imaging modality for invasive cancer, its role in preoperative surgical planning for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has not been established. We sought to determine whether preoperative MRI affects surgical treatment and outcomes in women with pure DCIS.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe reviewed consecutive records of women diagnosed with pure DCIS on core biopsy between 2000 and 2007. Patient characteristics, surgical planning, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without preoperative MRI. Multivariable regression was performed to determine which covariates were independently associated with mastectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 149 women diagnosed with DCIS, 38 underwent preoperative MRI. On univariate analysis, patients undergoing MRI were younger (50 years vs. 59 years; P < .001) and had larger DCIS size on final pathology (1.6 cm vs. 1.0 cm; P = .007) than those without MRI. Mastectomy and SLNB rates were significantly higher in the preoperative MRI group (45% vs. 14%, P < .001; and 47% vs. 23%, P = .004, respectively). However, there were no differences in number of re-excisions, margin status, and margin size between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, preoperative MRI and age were independently associated with mastectomy (OR, 3.16, P = .018; OR, 0.95, P = .031, respectively), while multifocality, size, and family history were not significant predictors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe found a strong association between preoperative MRI and mastectomy in women undergoing treatment for DCIS. Additional studies are needed to examine the increased rates of mastectomy as a possible consequence of preoperative MRI for DCIS."

                            "Breast MRI and ultrasound are the most popular imaging modalities for the assessment of preoperative stages of breast cancer. Breast MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for detection of breast cancer; however, it has a wide range of specificity and high false positive rates (Yamamoto et al., 2011)(Kuhl, 2008)(Sardanelli et al., 2004)(13)(Sardanelli et al., 2007). Breast ultrasound is a very convenient way to evaluate breast and lymph nodes, but is dependent on the doctors' experience and equipment. We often face difficulties in interpreting and correlating the http://dx.doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2016.17 kjronline.org radiological features between these two imaging modalities in preoperative evaluation of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2009)(Pons et al., 2014)."

NACT reduces the tumor burden in locally advanced breast cancer rendering BCS possible rather than mastectomy. (Carrara et al., 2017) In many of these patients, NACT achieves complete resolution of clinically palpable mass and radiological abnormality before surgery. There is a need to accurately localize the tumor site at the time of surgical excision to establish complete pathological response.

                            "PURPOSE\nInduction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to offer a higher rate of conservative surgery. The possibility of reduction in size, even in some cases complete clinical and mammographic regression, can make the localization of the tumor bed difficult at the time of surgery. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience about the utility of US-guided implantation of a metallic marker in patients with breast cancer before induction chemotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nForty-three patients with 44 masses were diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy of breast carcinoma. Before beginning of the induction chemotherapy all of them were referred for metallic marker placement. A metallic harpoon was placed under US guidance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne patient died during the chemotherapy. Six underwent mastectomy, and 9 still had a palpable tumor at the time of surgery. In the remaining 27 patients (with 28 lesions) pre-operative wire localization of the tumor bed was carried out: in 11 cases the harpoon was necessary for the localization of the tumor bed, in 6 the harpoon was useful, and in 11 patients the localization of the tumor could have been done without the marker. No complications were observed and the marker remained stable in all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients who undergo induction chemotherapy, the placement of a metallic harpoon under US guidance is a safe, simple and inexpensive technique for localization of the tumor bed previous to conservative surgery."

                            "OBJECTIVE\nTwo methods of deployment of metallic clips at the site of stereotactic core biopsy for breast calcifications are compared retrospectively.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOne hundred nineteen clips deployed through an 11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy probe at core biopsy sites were compared with 109 vascular ligating clips deployed at biopsy sites using an 18-gauge spinal needle. The distance of each clip from the position of the target calcification was assessed using stereotactic coordinates in 52 sequential cases and was measured on mammograms before and after biopsy in 108 clips deployed through an 11-gauge probe and 98 clips deployed using an 18-gauge needle. Variance in clip position between postbiopsy and follow-up mammograms was measured in 43 clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and in 44 clips placed with an 18-gauge needle. Comparable measurements of variance in position of fat necrosis calcifications between screening mammograms were used as controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-seven percent of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 98% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications using stereotactic coordinates. On mammograms obtained after biopsy, 70% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 63% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications, and the position of 91% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 90% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle varied less than 15 mm on follow-up mammograms. Both clips provided accurate targets for wire-localized excisions. The cost of the 11-gauge needle and clip is $320. The 14-gauge probe, vascular clip, and 18-gauge spinal needle cost $191.58.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA vascular ligating clip delivered to a stereotactic core biopsy site by an 18-gauge spinal needle is comparable in apparent accuracy and stability to a clip deployed through an 11-gauge probe. This technique allows core biopsies to be performed with instruments smaller than 11-gauge and at a 40% savings in equipment cost."

                            "Although BCS is the preferred surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer, it can be challenging to accurately identify the tumor site when the tumor is small and nonpalpable. This difficulty can lead to inadequate clearance of the margins associated with increased risk of local recurrence, and it requires a second operation for adequate margins. The current re-operation rate is approximately 25% on average, but some series report rates as high as 37% [6][7][8][9][10]. Thus, surgical guidance tools that can accurately locate the tumor and optimize the resection of adequate margins in real time are needed."
