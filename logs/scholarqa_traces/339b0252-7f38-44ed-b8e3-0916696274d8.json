The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times.

                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.",

The final chromatographic conditions consisted of a step gradient with two isocratic holds after various chromatographic conditions were explored during method development. \n\nPotential degradants such as myristic acid, lyso-PC 1 and 2, and stearic acid are more hydrophilic than their parent lipids and eluted in the first isocratic hold. The four main lipid components are highly hydrophobic and eluted in the second isocratic hold. Two isocratic holds were chosen to minimize the effect of each analytes response factor based on mobile phase composition [20]. Impurities or degradants were monitored by loss of four main lipid peaks and percent impurity analysis for any addition of new, unspecified peaks. Percent impurity analysis was performed by integrating any peaks apart from the void, system, and parent lipid peaks. This analysis was monitored and compared in stability studies to the zero time point. As previously mentioned, based on the relative response of each analyte, the universal response of both parent lipids and their degradants are not achievable with this method. It would be worth exploring this method with the use of an inverse gradient or another means to a more universal response for impurity analysis utilizing a CAD. \n\nFigure 2A shows the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1, and DSPC. These lipid components are separated in order of increasing retention time 9.60, 10.15, 12.00, and 13.40 min.

Klein, R. Rustandi, John W Loughney\n## Abstract\nFor many years, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used as delivery vehicles for various payloads (especially various oligonucleotides and mRNA), finding numerous applications in drug and vaccine development. LNP stability and bilayer fluidity are determined by the identities and the amounts of the various lipids employed in the formulation and LNP efficacy is determined in large part by the lipid composition which usually contains a cationic lipid, a PEG\u2010lipid conjugate, cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid. Analytical methods developed for LNP characterization must be able to determine not only the identity and content of each individual lipid component (i.e., the parent lipids), but also the associated impurities and degradants. In this work, we describe an efficient and sensitive reversed\u2010phase chromatographic method with charged aerosol detection (CAD) suitable for this purpose. Sample preparation diluent and mobile phase pH conditions are critical and have been optimized for the lipids of interest. This method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity for lipid analysis to support process and formulation development for new drugs and vaccines.\n## Introduction\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.\n...\nIn this article, we describe the development of a robust and efficient UHPLC-CAD method using commercially available materials and instrumentation is described for lipid analysis of mRNA loaded lipid nanoparticles used in vaccine candidates. Though three of the lipids mentioned in this article are proprietary and cannot be disclosed, this methodology is valuable to highlight in the growing field of mRNA-LNP technology. In addition to chromatography conditions, sample preparation diluent is also discussed due to its importance for accurate lipid quantitation. This method was validated using standard analytical parameters such as linearity, specificity, range, accuracy, and precision. Finally, an example lipid stability study is reported using the UHPLC-CAD method.\n\n## Chemicals and reagents\nThe LNP vaccine samples were prepared as previously described [18]. In the LNP vaccine manufacture process, a lipid mixture was prepared by dissolving cationic lipid, cholesterol, phospholipid, and PEG-conjugate lipid (molar ratio of 50-58:30-39:10:1-2) in ethanol. Then lipid nanoparticles were produced by simultaneous T-mixing of the lipid mixture with an aqueous solution mRNA, followed by stepwise dia-filtration [19]. Both starting solutions are submitted for analysis along with samples post diafiltration. Each submitted sample has a targeted mRNA dose concentration and is used for sample preparation.\n\n## Chromatographic separation\nA UHPLC method that can quantitate neutral and cationic lipids was developed for the evaluation of LNPs containing mRNA. The final chromatographic conditions consisted of a step gradient with two isocratic holds after various chromatographic conditions were explored during method development. \n\nPotential degradants such as myristic acid, lyso-PC 1 and 2, and stearic acid are more hydrophilic than their parent lipids and eluted in the first isocratic hold. The four main lipid components are highly hydrophobic and eluted in the second isocratic hold. Two isocratic holds were chosen to minimize the effect of each analytes response factor based on mobile phase composition [20]. Impurities or degradants were monitored by loss of four main lipid peaks and percent impurity analysis for any addition of new, unspecified peaks. Percent impurity analysis was performed by integrating any peaks apart from the void, system, and parent lipid peaks. This analysis was monitored and compared in stability studies to the zero time point. As previously mentioned, based on the relative response of each analyte, the universal response of both parent lipids and their degradants are not achievable with this method. It would be worth exploring this method with the use of an inverse gradient or another means to a more universal response for impurity analysis utilizing a CAD. \n\nFigure 2A shows the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1, and DSPC. These lipid components are separated in order of increasing retention time 9.60, 10.15, 12.00, and 13.40 min. Figure 2B illustrates the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing the four lipids PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC in order of increasing retention time at 9.25, 10.15, 11.75, and 13.40 min. In both formulations, the four main lipids were baseline resolved for identification and content analysis. \n\nOf the four lipid analytes, three of them (PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, and DSPC) have an overall neutral charge and are not affected by mobile phase pH.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nAn efficient and sensitive reverse-phase UHPLC-CAD method was developed for the analysis of lipid components of mRNA encapsulated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in order to support process and formulation development studies and clinical material release and stability testing. The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript. We also would like to extend our gratitude to our colleagues at Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA Vaccine Process Development and Vaccine Drug Product Development MRL for providing us with all of the LNP materials used for this study. \n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.",

The second one, relying on milder conditions, retains only the unencapsulated mRNA, which can be used to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency. Both methods were used on Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines and on Sanofi\u2019s in-development mRNA product as model samples. Our preliminary findings suggest that HILIC holds potential for online LNP disruption, mRNA integrity assessment, and encapsulation efficiency analysis. They also highlight the limitations of small-pore-sized columns currently available on the market.\n",

                    "text": "Single-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.",

Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood.

Lorbetskie, Michael J. W. Johnston, Lisheng Wang, Xuguang Li, Huixin Lu\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)\u2010lipid nanoparticle (LNP) biotherapeutics have demonstrated significant promise in disease treatment and prevention given their rapidly modifiable production processes and considerable capacity to adapt to complex or low\u2010yielding proteins of interest. As a result, many products are currently being developed in this space. Critically, well\u2010characterized and appropriately designed assays are required to monitor purity and integrity in order to maintain the efficacy and consistency of these novel products. Currently, capillary gel electrophoresis with laser\u2010induced fluorescence (CGE\u2010LIF) and ion\u2010pair reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography (IP\u2010RPLC) are techniques of choice for mRNA integrity analysis. However, most methods proposed for biotherapeutic analysis have been developed using naked mRNA without LNP components or proprietary buffer formulations, which can obscure undiscovered impurities or complex interactions between mRNA and the sample matrix. In this study, we addressed these methodological challenges by using a biotherapeutically relevant commercial mRNA\u2010LNP sample (approx. 4200 b) to refine and optimize a customizable CGE\u2010LIF method currently under consideration for mRNA\u2010LNP biotherapeutic analysis. We systematically characterized how critical method parameters\u2014such as denaturant type, concentration, and usage\u2014and LNP disruption protocols can interfere with accurate mRNA integrity analysis in CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC. We found that optimal conditions for CGE\u2010LIF assay sensitivity, variability, and resolution included sample precipitation by isopropanol, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of dye. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of both CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC are highlighted, and a discussion of key considerations when using or designing methods for mRNA integrity assessment is presented.\n## Introduction\nSingle-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.\n...\nAlthough this understanding is gradually forming in the biotherapeutic context for mRNA products [25,[31][32][33], many studies examine only naked mRNA [12,26,34] or use proprietary buffer formulations with closed instrumentation [35,36]. Although informative, unknown impurities may go uninvestigated due to missing components or unpredictable interactions with undisclosed components. Indeed, lipids are important to the mRNA impurity profile as Packer et al. reported the discovery of novel mRNA-lipid impurities, which were undetectable in a CGE method but present by IP-RPLC [25]. Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood. Given the emergence of this modality and the potential for novel impurities, it will be important to establish standard methods to accurately assess known CQAs while also maintaining the means to characterize unknown impurities through customizable methods. \n\nTo address the knowledge gaps of CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC method performance for mRNA-LNPs, we used a large commercial mRNA-LNP product (\u223c4200 b) to systematically evaluate critical method parameters for CGE-LIF and compared them to IP-RPLC. Both methods have been proposed for mRNA quality assessments [27]. In this study, we first examined how common gel additivesurea, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-impacted CGE-LIF resolution of an RNA ladder. Next, we evaluated how LNP disruption affects integrity measurements for the mRNA-LNP. Leveraging these observations, an experimental design was implemented to investigate both main and interaction effects of urea, formamide, and dye percentage. CGE-LIF performance was then compared to IP-RPLC analysis. Finally, a discussion on designing methods for consistency and standardization from a biotherapeutic perspective will be presented.",

                    "text": "In recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.",

Rustandi\n## Abstract\nMessenger RNA (mRNA)\u2010based vaccines are advantageous because they can be relatively quicker and more cost efficient to manufacture compared to other traditional vaccine products. Lipid nanoparticles have three common purposes: delivery, self\u2010adjuvanting properties, and mRNA protection. Faster vaccine development requires an efficient and fast assay to monitor mRNA purity and integrity. Microchip CE is known to be a robust technology that is capable of rapid separation. Here, we describe the development and optimization of a purity and integrity assay for mRNA\u2010based vaccines encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles using commercial microchip\u2010based separation. The analytical parameters of the optimized assay were assessed and the method is a stability indicating assay.\n## Introduction\nIn recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.",

In the case of LNPs, it has been shown that faceted internal and surface structures form between the nucleic acids and the lipidic components of the carrier, increasing the efficiency of RNA transfection due to a superior capacity to trigger dynamic membrane fusion and endosomal escape [16]. \n\nIf the determination of the particle structure per se is a very complex task, methods to measure the thermal stability and the evolution of surface charge of the nanoparticle vectors in biological environments could provide information about key structural properties and understand the relationship between these and the physical\u2212chemical properties of the nanovaccines and their dynamic changes in biological environments. As practical examples, the thermal stability of the nanocarrier structure can be explored by measuring particle size with DLS thermal ramps and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, changes in the surface charge of the nanocarrier responding to pH changes in physiological environments could be measured by performing a titration with electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). \n\nHighly complex, multicomponent, multifunctional viral and non-viral delivery vectors such as mRNA-LNPs and rAAVs require fit-for purpose robust measurement methods for their characterization and the optimization of their stability [17,18], as summarized in Table 1. Complementary information on particle size, size distribution, concentration, charge, and chemical composition are required to reliably study the effects of pH, incubation time, temperature, and other stress conditions on the stability and function of these complex molecular assemblies.",

                    "text": "A recent study has shown that the ionizable lipid is mainly located inside the core of the lipid nanoparticles and the interaction with mRNA can influence the ionizability of the lipid [18]. \n\nThe stability of the lipid nanoparticles could be lost in different ways, including aggregation, fusion, leakage of encapsulated mRNA or changes in the concentration of components at the surface of the nanoparticles. The consistent z-average diameters and zeta potential means obtained from repeat measurements of mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 summarized in Table 7 confirm that neither aggregation nor fusion are present and that the lipid nanoparticles are stable during the measurement period. Any change in zeta potential values across repeat measurements would suggest that changes in the composition of surface components may be occurring. Repeat measurements are important to perform to ensure that there are no stability issues present Figure 10 summarizes the zeta potential values (in mV) as a function of pH for mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 prepared in 10 mM NaCl. The zeta potential values of both mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 show similar values at both low and high pH values. However, they exhibit different isoelectric points (pI) with mRNA-LNP1 having a pI at pH 5.90, whilst mRNA-LNP2 has a pI at pH 5.21. This difference in the pI values is due to the different ionizable lipids which are present in both lipid nanoparticle samples. The pI values of the two mRNA-LNP samples do not correspond with the pKa values of the different ionizable lipids present in the nanoparticles but does correlate with the lipid to mRNA ratio and are consistent with other observations reported [25]. \n\nPerforming pH titrations is important in understanding how sensitive samples are to changes in pH conditions and how this could influence formulation stability.",

During product development and process control, their design, characterization, and quality control require the combination of fit-for-purpose complementary analytical tools. Moreover, an in-depth methodological expertise and holistic approach to data analysis are required for robust measurements and to enable an adequate interpretation of experimental findings. Here the combination of complementary label-free biophysical techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle-DLS (MADLS), Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), multiple detection SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been successfully used for the characterization of physical and chemical attributes of rAAV and LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Methods\u2019 performance, applicability, dynamic range of detection and method optimization are discussed for the measurements of multiple critical physical\u2212chemical quality attributes, including particle size distribution, aggregation propensity, polydispersity, particle concentration, particle structural properties and nucleic acid payload.\n## Introduction\nThe structural interactions between the active nucleic acids and the lipidic excipients generate a highly complex particle structure that dynamically changes, responding to modification of the physiological environment, e.g., responding to carrier protein interactions and to the changes of physiological pHs encountered in the biological tissues and in specific intracellular compartments. In the case of LNPs, it has been shown that faceted internal and surface structures form between the nucleic acids and the lipidic components of the carrier, increasing the efficiency of RNA transfection due to a superior capacity to trigger dynamic membrane fusion and endosomal escape [16]. \n\nIf the determination of the particle structure per se is a very complex task, methods to measure the thermal stability and the evolution of surface charge of the nanoparticle vectors in biological environments could provide information about key structural properties and understand the relationship between these and the physical\u2212chemical properties of the nanovaccines and their dynamic changes in biological environments. As practical examples, the thermal stability of the nanocarrier structure can be explored by measuring particle size with DLS thermal ramps and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, changes in the surface charge of the nanocarrier responding to pH changes in physiological environments could be measured by performing a titration with electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). \n\nHighly complex, multicomponent, multifunctional viral and non-viral delivery vectors such as mRNA-LNPs and rAAVs require fit-for purpose robust measurement methods for their characterization and the optimization of their stability [17,18], as summarized in Table 1. Complementary information on particle size, size distribution, concentration, charge, and chemical composition are required to reliably study the effects of pH, incubation time, temperature, and other stress conditions on the stability and function of these complex molecular assemblies.\n\n## Zeta Potential Discussion\nA recent study has shown that the ionizable lipid is mainly located inside the core of the lipid nanoparticles and the interaction with mRNA can influence the ionizability of the lipid [18]. \n\nThe stability of the lipid nanoparticles could be lost in different ways, including aggregation, fusion, leakage of encapsulated mRNA or changes in the concentration of components at the surface of the nanoparticles. The consistent z-average diameters and zeta potential means obtained from repeat measurements of mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 summarized in Table 7 confirm that neither aggregation nor fusion are present and that the lipid nanoparticles are stable during the measurement period. Any change in zeta potential values across repeat measurements would suggest that changes in the composition of surface components may be occurring. Repeat measurements are important to perform to ensure that there are no stability issues present Figure 10 summarizes the zeta potential values (in mV) as a function of pH for mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 prepared in 10 mM NaCl. The zeta potential values of both mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 show similar values at both low and high pH values. However, they exhibit different isoelectric points (pI) with mRNA-LNP1 having a pI at pH 5.90, whilst mRNA-LNP2 has a pI at pH 5.21. This difference in the pI values is due to the different ionizable lipids which are present in both lipid nanoparticle samples. The pI values of the two mRNA-LNP samples do not correspond with the pKa values of the different ionizable lipids present in the nanoparticles but does correlate with the lipid to mRNA ratio and are consistent with other observations reported [25]. \n\nPerforming pH titrations is important in understanding how sensitive samples are to changes in pH conditions and how this could influence formulation stability.",

Guerrini, Dora Mehn, Diletta Scaccabarozzi, S. Gioria, L. Calzolai\n## Abstract\nThe approval of safe and effective LNP-mRNA vaccines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is catalyzing the development of the next generation of mRNA therapeutics. Proper characterization methods are crucial for assessing the quality and efficacy of these complex formulations. Here, we show that analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can measure, simultaneously and without any sample preparation step, the sedimentation coefficients of both the LNP-mRNA formulation and the mRNA molecules. This allows measuring several quality attributes, such as particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency and density of the formulation. The technique can also be applied to study the stability of the formulation under stress conditions and different buffers.\n## Introduction\nLipid Nanoparticles-encapsulated mRNA (LNPs-mRNA) have played a pivotal role in the global response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with proven safety and efficacy, and are now at various stages of development against a variety of other infectious diseases or studied for cell and gene therapies [1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nLNP-mRNA formulations used in Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines contain four different lipids and the cargo, a ribonucleic molecule, encoding a protein intended to elicit an immune response, in case of vaccines, or to treat aberrantly expressed gene(s), in case of genetic diseases.\n\nVarious studies demonstrated that the proper assembly and stability of LNPs are particularly crucial for their safety and efficacy [7][8][9].We have also previously published a characterization cascade suggested to address key challenges in the preclinical characterization and identify potential pitfalls during the LNPs-mRNA synthesis [10].\n\nThe implementation of a structured characterization strategy contributes to improve RNA therapeutics quality and reduces development times, a critical aspect, especially in response to emerging pathogen outbreaks [10,11].\n\nThe size of the LNPs-mRNA particles and the amount of encapsulated mRNA are two critical quality attributes strongly related to in vitro potency.Based on recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q2R2 guidance documents applicable to LNP-mRNA formulation, for the validation of the measurement of complex quality attributes, a combination of orthogonal techniques that ideally applies different measurement principles is recommended [12,13].\n\nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) has been applied as a sizing method for macromolecules [14][15][16][17][18] although the technique has broader applications including nanomaterials [19][20][21][22] and liposomes [23].\n\n## Conclusions\nAUC is a robust method for measuring the particle size distribution of LNP-mRNA formulations, underpinned by extensive scientific literature [14,19,20] and existing protocols [25,30].The application of the technique requires quite substantial instrument and expertise investment, but very limited sample preparation and relatively small efforts in terms of time needed for parameter optimization and data analysis.\n\nAUC is able to detect not only the floating but also the sedimenting fractions in LNP-mRNA formulations.This opens new perspectives in the application of the technique as it could be used not only for size distribution profiling of LNPs, but also to reveal the presence of sedimenting sub-population(s) in the sample and to discriminate the mRNA encapsulated in the LNP formulations from the non-encapsulated free mRNA molecules, or possibly, mRNA-lipid adducts.\n\nThe technique requires a relatively low amount of sample and no sample preparation (apart from dilution step).This is extremely important as it avoids any potential bias in the results that could be introduced by ultrafiltration steps, RNA extraction, or particle disruption that are needed when using other analytical techniques.The simplicity of the sample preparation and the specific detection of the signal from the RNA molecule (using the UV detector at 260 nm) also allow the characterization of LNP-mRNA in physiologically relevant media [34].\n\nThese results show that AUC is a very useful technique for the characterization of LNP-mRNA formulations and provide an additional technique for the quality assessment of this class of advanced therapeutics.",

The choice and design of microfluidic mixers are often seen as a key driving force affecting the critical quality attributes of the resulting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Methods: This study aimed to evaluate LNPs manufactured using two low-cost microfluidic mixers alongside manual mixing (pipette mixing (PM)), followed by characterization studies using orthogonal analytics as well as expression studies to establish whether low-cost microfluidic manufacturing methods are suitable for bench-scale and high-throughput research. Results: The results show that all manufacturing methods can produce LNPs with sizes ranging between 95 and 215 nm with high encapsulation (70\u2013100%), and enhanced analytics showed variations between the LNPs produced using the different mixers. Despite these differences, pipette mixing production of LNPs demonstrated its application as a high-throughput screening tool for LNPs, effectively distinguishing between different formulations and predicting consistent expression patterns both in vitro and in vivo.

McLoughlin, Chukwuebuka R. Obiora, Heather Stockdale, Ben Thomas, Martina Nutman, Sarah Brockbank, Z. Rattray, Yvonne Perrie\n## Abstract\nBackground/Objectives: Microfluidic mixing has become the gold standard procedure for manufacturing nucleic acid lipid-based delivery systems, offering precise control over critical process parameters. The choice and design of microfluidic mixers are often seen as a key driving force affecting the critical quality attributes of the resulting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Methods: This study aimed to evaluate LNPs manufactured using two low-cost microfluidic mixers alongside manual mixing (pipette mixing (PM)), followed by characterization studies using orthogonal analytics as well as expression studies to establish whether low-cost microfluidic manufacturing methods are suitable for bench-scale and high-throughput research. Results: The results show that all manufacturing methods can produce LNPs with sizes ranging between 95 and 215 nm with high encapsulation (70\u2013100%), and enhanced analytics showed variations between the LNPs produced using the different mixers. Despite these differences, pipette mixing production of LNPs demonstrated its application as a high-throughput screening tool for LNPs, effectively distinguishing between different formulations and predicting consistent expression patterns both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Overall, these results validate the use of low-cost microfluidic mixers without compromising the efficiency and integrity of the resulting LNPs. This study supports the increased accessibility of small-scale LNP manufacturing and high-throughput screening.\n## Determining Lipid and mRNA Integrity of LNPs\nPost-manufacture monitoring of LNPs is essential for ensuring the stability and efficacy of LNP-based formulations.

In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.",

Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations.

Fekete, C. Doneanu, Balasubrahmayam Addepalli, Maissa M. Gaye, Jennifer Nguyen, B. Alden, R. Birdsall, Duanduan Han, G. Isaac, M. Lauber\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nA schematic representation of a four-component lipid nanoparticle is provided in Fig. 2. \n\nThe use of LNP mRNA has proven to be highly effective for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but therapeutic applications expand well beyond just vaccines [8]. In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.\n\n## Lipid compositional analysis\nLipid nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism for mRNA-based therapies present their own challenges in terms of characterization and analysis. Fundamentally, the lipid nanoparticle is comprised of four lipids (e.g., cationic/ionizable lipids, phospholipids, pegylated lipids, and cholesterol) at a specific ratio, each of which play a role in the stability, delivery, and efficacy of the nanoparticle. While elegant in design, similarities in the physicochemical properties of the lipids, as well as their relative abundance, require consideration when developing characterization and stability indicating methods. \n\nThe first analytical consideration to make in this regard is one about sample preparation. Ideas for sample preparation can be drawn from understanding how LNPs are formed. Ganesan and Narayanasamy have comprehensively reviewed a wide array of LNP preparation approaches [90]. Most commonly, two solutions are prepared for mixing -one is an ethanol solution of lipids and the other is an aqueous solution of mRNA. The aqueous solution is ratiometrically introduced to the ethanolic lipid solution using mixing techniques ranging from pipette aspiration to microfluidics. The assembly of the LNP can be reversed for the sake of compositional analysis. A preferred approach for this involves dissolving the particle by the addition of organic solvent. An RPLC analysis with either evaporative light scattering, charged aerosol, or mass spectrometric detection can thereafter be performed. Methanol is a commonly used organic solvent for liposome disruption where it can alter bilayer membrane structures and release the encapsulated drugs. Methanol and other organic solvents have proven to be equally effective at dissolving solid lipid nanoparticles. In fact, mixtures of chloroform and methanol and solutions containing methanol or isopropanol have also been used with success [91]. Li et al. prepared individual samples for siRNA and Fig. 8. Use of LC-MS to quantify a Cap-0 5'-end terminus species in the presence of its Cap-1 analog.\n\n## Conclusion and perspectives\nMoreover, ribonucleases can be applied to partially digest mRNA so that it can be possible to map and deeply interrogate its molecular composition. Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control. We hope each of the above topics have shed light on some of the very important ways in which LC-based methods have aided the development of the first generation of LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals. New progress on analytical tools for LNP mRNA are bound to be realized along with further clinical success, and the field of separation science appears to be at the heart of future efforts.",

Synthetic RNA products are a low-cost solution based on a novel method of using nucleosides to act as an innate medicine factory with unlimited therapeutic possibilities. In addition to the common perception of vaccines preventing infections, the newer applications of RNA therapies include preventing autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Down syndrome; now, we can deliver monoclonal antibodies, hormones, cytokines, and other complex proteins, reducing the manufacturing hurdles associated with these products. Newer PCR technology removes the need for the bacterial expression of DNA, making mRNA a truly synthetic product. AI-driven product design expands the applications of mRNA technology to repurpose therapeutic proteins and test their safety and efficacy quickly. As the industry focuses on mRNA, many novel opportunities will arise, as hundreds of products under development will bring new perspectives based on this significant paradigm shift\u2014finding newer solutions to existing challenges in healthcare.\n## Final Formulation\nFormulating lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA products is a critical step in developing mRNA-based therapeutics, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies.

The stability of LNPs can also be influenced by factors such as lipid composition, pH, and storage conditions, and formulation optimization is necessary to ensure the long-term stability and shelf-life of the LNP mRNA products. \n\nCharacterization and validation: LNPs are characterized and validated to ensure their quality, safety, and efficacy. Various analytical techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), may be used to characterize the size, morphology, and encapsulation efficiency of LNPs. In vitro and in vivo studies are also conducted to validate the biological activity and therapeutic potential of LNP mRNA products. \n\nThe formulation of LNP mRNA products is a complex and crucial process in developing mRNA-based therapeutics. Optimizing lipid composition, encapsulation efficiency, particle size, and stability is essential to ensuring the efficient mRNA delivery, cellular uptake, and therapeutic efficacy of LNP mRNA products. Rigorous quality control and characterization are also critical to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of LNP mRNA formulations for clinical use [46].",

                    "text": "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability. The developed methods are very sensitive in showing even the smallest changes in the samples, as evident from the measurements of the samples after 1 week of storage in the refrigerator. In addition, empty and loaded LNPs can be clearly differentiated. Therefore, the presented methods offer several advancements compared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is",

Kramer, H. W\u00e4tzig\n## Abstract\nTwo imaged capillary isoelectric focusing methods were developed to provide insight into the quality and stability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, specifically, mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). A variety of stressed and lipid composition\u2010modified samples were measured and detected by their UV absorption. The results were supported by the data of an encapsulation assay and particle sizing. One method, using 9 M urea as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape offers detailed information. The summed peak area of both peaks showed RSDs from 2% to 8% when one batch was measured in triplicate and apparently depends on the size of the LNPs. In the second method, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N\u2010ethylurea was used. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the isoelectric point (pI, <0.5%). The repeatable peak area (RSD of 2%\u20137%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, which also applies to the first method, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Furthermore, experiments with the addition of a fluorescent dye were performed (fluorescence detection), which tremendously increased the sensitivity of the methods. Both methods can be used to characterize the stability of mRNA\u2010loaded LNPs, for example, when investigating various storage times at different temperatures and freeze\u2013thaw cycles, as well as the ability of the methods to distinguish lipid compositions and measure batch\u2010to\u2010batch variability.\n## CONCLUDING REMARKS\nTwo iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability. The developed methods are very sensitive in showing even the smallest changes in the samples, as evident from the measurements of the samples after 1 week of storage in the refrigerator. In addition, empty and loaded LNPs can be clearly differentiated. Therefore, the presented methods offer several advancements compared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is\n...\ncompared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is certainly available by analyzing different variants of the LNP recipes by methods A and B.\n\nThe addition of the fluorescent dye TNS resulted in a massive increase in the sensitivity of both methods and should indeed be considered further for use in iCIEF.\n\nOverall, this paper shows that iCIEF analysis is very well suitable for the characterization of mRNA vaccines. This approach is an important analytical tool for the ongoing pandemic and beyond. After widespread use for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines as such convinced competent authorities, and we can expect many more pharmaceuticals of this type in the future, and in addition exceptional options for mRNA-based cancer treatments.",

Minsker, S. Ha, R. Rustandi\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been employed for drug delivery in small molecules, siRNA, mRNA, and pDNA for both therapeutics and vaccines. Characterization of LNPs is challenging because they are heterogeneous mixtures of large complex particles. Many tools for particle size characterization, such as dynamic and static light scattering, have been applied as well as morphology analysis using electron microscopy. CE has been applied for the characterization of many different large particles such as liposomes, polymer, and viruses. However, there have been limited efforts to characterize the surface charge of LNPs and CIEF has not been explored for this type of particle. Typically, LNPs for delivery of oligonucleotides contain at least four different lipids, with at least one being an ionizable cationic lipid. Here, we describe the development of an imaged capillary isoelectric focusing method used to measure the surface charge (i.e., pI) of an LNP\u2010based mRNA vaccine.

The rapid, potent, and transient properties of mRNA-encoded proteins make them attractive tools for the effective treatment of a variety of conditions, ranging from infectious diseases to cancer and single-gene disorders. The capability for rapid and large-scale production of mRNA therapeutics fueled the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For effective clinical implementation, it is crucial to deeply characterize and control important mRNA attributes such as purity/integrity, identity, structural quality features, and functionality. This implies the use of powerful and advanced analytical techniques for quality control and characterization of mRNA. Improvements in analytical techniques such as electrophoresis, chromatography, mass spectrometry, sequencing, and functionality assessments have significantly enhanced the quality and detail of information available for product and process characterization, as well as for routine stability and release testing. Here, we review the latest advancements in analytical techniques for the characterization of mRNA-based therapeutics, typically employed by the biopharmaceutical industry for eventual market release.",

Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression.",

Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. The main benefit of IP-RP LC over other chromatographic modes (such as AEX, SEC, and SC) is that it can be easily coupled with MS, considerably broadening its field of application. IP-RP LC-MS is often used for measuring important structural features of mRNA molecules, such as 5 \u2032 capping efficiency and 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail length [43]. Structural characterizations for the capping efficiency and the poly(A) tail by LC-MS have been recently reviewed [41,43].",

The rapid, potent, and transient properties of mRNA-encoded proteins make them attractive tools for the effective treatment of a variety of conditions, ranging from infectious diseases to cancer and single-gene disorders. The capability for rapid and large-scale production of mRNA therapeutics fueled the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For effective clinical implementation, it is crucial to deeply characterize and control important mRNA attributes such as purity/integrity, identity, structural quality features, and functionality. This implies the use of powerful and advanced analytical techniques for quality control and characterization of mRNA. Improvements in analytical techniques such as electrophoresis, chromatography, mass spectrometry, sequencing, and functionality assessments have significantly enhanced the quality and detail of information available for product and process characterization, as well as for routine stability and release testing. Here, we review the latest advancements in analytical techniques for the characterization of mRNA-based therapeutics, typically employed by the biopharmaceutical industry for eventual market release.\n## Ion-Pair Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography\nCurrie et al. showed that the formed degradation products appeared as shorter RNA fragments in front of the main peak and could be well monitored, and the relative stability of the mRNA under the various stressed conditions could be assessed [50]. Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression.\n...\nHowever, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69].

The main benefit of IP-RP LC over other chromatographic modes (such as AEX, SEC, and SC) is that it can be easily coupled with MS, considerably broadening its field of application. IP-RP LC-MS is often used for measuring important structural features of mRNA molecules, such as 5 \u2032 capping efficiency and 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail length [43]. Structural characterizations for the capping efficiency and the poly(A) tail by LC-MS have been recently reviewed [41,43].",

                    "text": "We evaluated a new online method for determining the distribution of RNA content versus LNP-RNA size, enabling advanced LNP-RNA characterization. The method utilizes a standard SEC-MALS-UV-dRI system and is implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis module of ASTRA software. The calculated RNA wt % results from four LNPs, made with different types of PEG-lipids and compositional ratios, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by and fractionation with offline RPLC analysis. This work indicates that the correction of the scattering contribution to the UV signal implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis algorithm was adequate for reliable sizedependent RNA content analysis of lipid nanoparticles. Based on these results, we conclude that the online method is, in all likelihood, suitable for rapid and facile determination of the sized-dependent payload distribution of other LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, or other carriers constructed from excipients that do not absorb UV at the characteristic absorption wavelength of the payload. The analytical advancement reported here provides additional characterization information, and potentially sheds light on understanding the therapeutic outcome of the RNA/DNA filled LNPs. We foresee the potential for use in quality control procedures, to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which would constitute a critical quality attribute of a therapeutic LNP-RNA product.",

Their data showed correlation between the cationic polymer/RNA ratio and RNA gene-silencing potency, which highlighted the importance of size-based compositional assessment of the LNP-RNAs. \n\nAlthough semi-preparative fractionation by size with offline fraction analysis provides a viable approach to analysis of size-based compositional heterogeneity, the experiment is lengthy and laborious, and not suitable for use as a routine analytical procedure. Online analysis of the RNA payload versus size, in a single automated run, would be highly desirable.\n\n## Conclusion\nWe evaluated a new online method for determining the distribution of RNA content versus LNP-RNA size, enabling advanced LNP-RNA characterization. The method utilizes a standard SEC-MALS-UV-dRI system and is implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis module of ASTRA software. The calculated RNA wt % results from four LNPs, made with different types of PEG-lipids and compositional ratios, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by and fractionation with offline RPLC analysis. This work indicates that the correction of the scattering contribution to the UV signal implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis algorithm was adequate for reliable sizedependent RNA content analysis of lipid nanoparticles. Based on these results, we conclude that the online method is, in all likelihood, suitable for rapid and facile determination of the sized-dependent payload distribution of other LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, or other carriers constructed from excipients that do not absorb UV at the characteristic absorption wavelength of the payload. The analytical advancement reported here provides additional characterization information, and potentially sheds light on understanding the therapeutic outcome of the RNA/DNA filled LNPs. We foresee the potential for use in quality control procedures, to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which would constitute a critical quality attribute of a therapeutic LNP-RNA product.",

Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures.

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n## Characterization techniques\nInsufficient systematic analysis and tracking of LNP-mRNA both on the shelf and in vivo impede the broader applications for mRNA medicines.Conventional characterizations primarily rely on size, zeta potential analyzed by dynamic light scattering, and encapsulation efficiency assessed through fluorescence methods.However, these methods often fall short of meeting the stringent standards required for pharmaceutical production.Research on the proportion of empty particles is an ongoing endeavor, yielding significant findings in academic settings.However, the translation of these discoveries into industrial production has been limited.Li et al. reported a method based on the multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) technique to examine mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations at the single-nanoparticle level [111,133].The mechanism and methodology of their equipment and technique are shown in Fig. 11.They differentiated unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs, and mRNA-loaded LNPs by employing coincidence and quantitative analysis of fluorescent tags on various LNP components and fluorescence of single mRNA molecules.Their findings indicated that a frequently cited benchmark formulation, incorporating ionizable lipid DLin-MC3, predominantly accommodates two mRNAs per loaded LNP.The presence of empty LNPs ranged from 40% to 80%, contingent on the specific assembly conditions.By altering the molar ratio of pegylated lipid and N/P ratio [this ratio refers to the ratio between positively charged amine groups (N) of the LNP and negatively charged phosphate groups (P) of RNA], they demonstrated a mechanism of kinetically controlled assembly that governs the distribution of payload and capacity within LNP.The discovery serves as a comprehensive understanding of the molecular assembly of LNP-mRNA.However, it inevitably relied on fluorescence labeling (Cy5 or YOYO) of the nucleic acid to distinguish between encapsulated and free mRNA, hindering the applicability of in situ analysis on the scalable production of mRNA-LNP.\n...\nHowever, it inevitably relied on fluorescence labeling (Cy5 or YOYO) of the nucleic acid to distinguish between encapsulated and free mRNA, hindering the applicability of in situ analysis on the scalable production of mRNA-LNP.At the same time, Wyatt Technology provides an alternative for quantified payload analysis for LNP-RNA based on size separation system, size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), or more often field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering (FFF-MALS), measuring high-resolution size distributions, particle concentration, and morphology in a single run.However, high cost associated with the analysis hinders its widespread adoption.Systematic analysis and regulatory release criteria for LNP-mRNA remain incomplete.Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing mRNA therapeutics to clinical investigation and approval.",

The 5 \u2032 cap and 3 \u2032 polyA tail allow for efficient translation, and the UTRs are designed to optimize protein expression [19]. A single mRNA molecule can be designed to code for multiple peptides [9]; alternatively, multiple mRNAs that each encode for a different protein can be mixed to create a multivalent vaccine formulation. The mRNA(s) is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to stabilize the mRNA, enable cellular uptake of the mRNA(s) for protein expression [19], and improve the in vivo stability of mRNA. \n\nAnalytics for measuring mRNA critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as identity, concentration, and integrity throughout the vaccine manufacturing process are emerging and evolving, but many existing tools are inherently singleplex and therefore not compatible with characterizing multivalent mRNA and may not be optimal for characterizing mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [20][21][22][23]. The absorbance-based quantification of nucleic acids can be performed quickly and easily using UV spectroscopy for naked mRNA or via the fluorescence-based RiboGreen assay for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [23]. However, absorbance-based methods can only measure total mRNA content and cannot provide information about integrity or distinguish the concentration of each unique mRNA in a multivalent mixture.",

Gerold, Evan Toth, Rebecca H. Blair, Rachel Y. Gao, D. Nadkarni, Sutapa Barua, Joshua Woods, K. Rowlen, Erica D. Dawson\n## Abstract\nmRNA vaccines were highly effective in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, making them an attractive platform to address cancers and other infectious diseases. Many new mRNA vaccines in development are multivalent, which represents a difficulty for the standard assays commonly used to characterize the critical quality attributes of monovalent formulations. Here, we present a multiplexed analytical tool with nucleic acid microarray technology using the VaxArray platform that measures the identity and quantity of mono- and multivalent mixtures of naked mRNA and mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle formulations in under 2 h without any additional preparation steps, such as extraction or RT-PCR. Using a quadrivalent mixture of encapsulated mRNA constructs that encode for four unique proteins in a vaccine formulation, the VaxArray mRNA assay was demonstrated to be highly specific for each mRNA with sensitivity < 1 \u00b5g/mL. The quantification of individual mRNAs within the lipid nanoparticle mixture resulted in a precision of \u226410% RSD and an accuracy of 100 \u00b1 9%.\n## Introduction\nSince the approval of the initial COMIR-NATY and SpikeVax monovalent vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, there have been on-market multivalent mRNA vaccines as well as ongoing clinical trials for multivalent vaccines targeting multiple subtypes or variants of a single pathogen [14 -16], including bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines [14,15], multivalent influenza vaccines targeting 4 hemagglutinin (HA) [14,16] proteins and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [16,17], and combination seasonal influenza/COVID-19 vaccine targets [14,16]. \n\nmRNA comprises (5 \u2032 to 3 \u2032 ) a 5 \u2032 cap, a 5 \u2032 untranslated region (UTR), the coding sequence for the antigen of interest, a 3 \u2032 UTR, and a 3 \u2032 polyA tail [18,19]. The 5 \u2032 cap and 3 \u2032 polyA tail allow for efficient translation, and the UTRs are designed to optimize protein expression [19]. A single mRNA molecule can be designed to code for multiple peptides [9]; alternatively, multiple mRNAs that each encode for a different protein can be mixed to create a multivalent vaccine formulation. The mRNA(s) is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to stabilize the mRNA, enable cellular uptake of the mRNA(s) for protein expression [19], and improve the in vivo stability of mRNA. \n\nAnalytics for measuring mRNA critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as identity, concentration, and integrity throughout the vaccine manufacturing process are emerging and evolving, but many existing tools are inherently singleplex and therefore not compatible with characterizing multivalent mRNA and may not be optimal for characterizing mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [20][21][22][23]. The absorbance-based quantification of nucleic acids can be performed quickly and easily using UV spectroscopy for naked mRNA or via the fluorescence-based RiboGreen assay for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [23]. However, absorbance-based methods can only measure total mRNA content and cannot provide information about integrity or distinguish the concentration of each unique mRNA in a multivalent mixture.",

Despite their complex lipid composition, their quality is primarily judged by particle characteristics and nucleic acid encapsulation. In this study, we present a holistic reversed-phase (RP)-charged aerosol detection (CAD)-based method developed for commonly used LNP formulations, allowing for intensified LNP and process characterization. We used an experimental approach for power function value (PFV) optimization termed exploratory calibration, providing a single PFV (1.3) in an appropriate linearity range for all six lipids. Followed by the procedure of method calibration and validation, linearity (10\u2013400 ng, R2 > 0.996), precision, accuracy, and robustness were effectively proven. To complement the commonly determined LNP attributes and to evaluate the process performance across LNP processing, the developed RP-CAD method was applied in a process parameter study varying the total flow rate (TFR) during microfluidic mixing. The RP-CAD method revealed a constant lipid molar ratio across processing but identified deviations in the theoretical lipid content and general lipid loss, which were both, however, entirely TFR-independent. The deviations in lipid content could be successfully traced back to the lipid stock solution preparation. In contrast, the observed lipid loss was attributable to the small-scale dialysis following microfluidic mixing. Overall, this study establishes a foundation for employing RP-CAD for lipid quantification throughout LNP processing, and it highlights the potential to extend its applicability to other LNPs, process parameter studies, or processes such as cross-flow filtration.",

To demonstrate the RP-CAD method's applicability for quantifying lipids at various stages of the LNP process regardless of specific process parameters, the impact of the TFR as a production parameter on the LNP attributes was studied using LNPs encapsulating a DNA-based model-siRNA. In addition to the commonly determined attributes, particle size, surface charge, and nucleic acid encapsulation, we simultaneously assessed lipid quantities and lipid molar ratio with the newly developed RP-CAD method.

Beckert, Annabelle Dietrich, J\u00fcrgen Hubbuch\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and their versatile nucleic acid payloads bear great potential as delivery systems. Despite their complex lipid composition, their quality is primarily judged by particle characteristics and nucleic acid encapsulation. In this study, we present a holistic reversed-phase (RP)-charged aerosol detection (CAD)-based method developed for commonly used LNP formulations, allowing for intensified LNP and process characterization. We used an experimental approach for power function value (PFV) optimization termed exploratory calibration, providing a single PFV (1.3) in an appropriate linearity range for all six lipids. Followed by the procedure of method calibration and validation, linearity (10\u2013400 ng, R2 > 0.996), precision, accuracy, and robustness were effectively proven. To complement the commonly determined LNP attributes and to evaluate the process performance across LNP processing, the developed RP-CAD method was applied in a process parameter study varying the total flow rate (TFR) during microfluidic mixing. The RP-CAD method revealed a constant lipid molar ratio across processing but identified deviations in the theoretical lipid content and general lipid loss, which were both, however, entirely TFR-independent. The deviations in lipid content could be successfully traced back to the lipid stock solution preparation. In contrast, the observed lipid loss was attributable to the small-scale dialysis following microfluidic mixing. Overall, this study establishes a foundation for employing RP-CAD for lipid quantification throughout LNP processing, and it highlights the potential to extend its applicability to other LNPs, process parameter studies, or processes such as cross-flow filtration.\n## Introduction\nBased on an experimental approach, we systematically varied the PFV using a simplified lipid stock solution set, focusing on identifying a single PFV for multiple lipids. By expanding the stock solution set for method calibration and validation studies, we demonstrated adequate linearity, precision, accuracy, and robustness according to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q2(R2) guideline [38], enabling lipid quantification in pure and mixed lipid solutions. To demonstrate the RP-CAD method's applicability for quantifying lipids at various stages of the LNP process regardless of specific process parameters, the impact of the TFR as a production parameter on the LNP attributes was studied using LNPs encapsulating a DNA-based model-siRNA. In addition to the commonly determined attributes, particle size, surface charge, and nucleic acid encapsulation, we simultaneously assessed lipid quantities and lipid molar ratio with the newly developed RP-CAD method. These lipid quantities allow for the calculation of lipid recoveries, providing an indicator of the process performance in LNP purification and thus enabling intensified process characterization.",

In this study, a simulation system was constructed based on the lipid components and ratios of the mRNA-1273 vaccine [31], and long-term all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Using the converged MD trajectories, structural comparisons of mRNA-LNPs were made in two acidic environments (acetic acid and citric acid) and under different (N/P) ratios, employing analyses such as density distribution, radial distribution function, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Subsequently, possible mRNA encapsulation mechanisms were proposed based on binding free energy and cluster analysis. Notably, this study simulates lipid nanoparticles formed through mRNA encapsulation using the solvent injection method, serving as a reference for another experimental study. Overall, this work reveals the molecular recognition and encapsulation processes between mRNA and LNPs. \n\nIt not only provides guidance for optimizing LNP formulations but also contributes to the precise regulation of LNP stability and mRNA drug release properties, offering significant theoretical and practical value for the development of drug delivery systems.",

This study aims to explore the mechanisms by which LNPs encapsulate mRNA, as well as the effects of different N/P ratios and acid types in nucleic acid solutions on the structure and properties of LNPs, using the ethanol solvent injection method as the encapsulation technique. Six systems were designed, based on the composition and proportions of the existing mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the self-assembly process of LNPs. Ethanol was used as a solvent instead of pure water to better mimic experimental conditions. The results indicate that lipid components self-assemble into nanoparticles under neutral conditions, with the ionizable lipid SM-102 predominantly concentrating in the core of the particles. Upon mixing with nucleic acids in acidic conditions, LNPs undergo disassembly, during which protonated SM-102 encapsulates mRNA through electrostatic interactions, forming stable hydrogen bonds. Cluster structure analysis revealed that the four lipid components of LNPs are distributed sequentially from the outside inwards as DMG-PEG 2000, DSPC, cholesterol, and protonated SM-102. Moreover, LNPs constructed under low pH or low N/P ratios using citric acid exhibited larger volumes and more uniform distribution. These findings provide a scientific basis for further designing and optimizing LNP components to enhance the efficacy of mRNA vaccine encapsulation.\n## Introduction\nInvestigating the microscopic dynamics during the preparation of mRNA-LNPs can aid in the optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations and improve mRNA delivery efficiency. In this study, a simulation system was constructed based on the lipid components and ratios of the mRNA-1273 vaccine [31], and long-term all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Using the converged MD trajectories, structural comparisons of mRNA-LNPs were made in two acidic environments (acetic acid and citric acid) and under different (N/P) ratios, employing analyses such as density distribution, radial distribution function, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Subsequently, possible mRNA encapsulation mechanisms were proposed based on binding free energy and cluster analysis. Notably, this study simulates lipid nanoparticles formed through mRNA encapsulation using the solvent injection method, serving as a reference for another experimental study. Overall, this work reveals the molecular recognition and encapsulation processes between mRNA and LNPs. \n\nIt not only provides guidance for optimizing LNP formulations but also contributes to the precise regulation of LNP stability and mRNA drug release properties, offering significant theoretical and practical value for the development of drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "Therapeutic drugs and multivalent vaccines based on the delivery of mRNA via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technologies are expected to dominate the biopharmaceutical industry landscape in the coming years. Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism for mRNA-based therapies present their own challenges in terms of characterization and analysis. Fundamentally, the lipid nanoparticle is comprised of four lipids (e.g., cationic/ionizable lipids, phospholipids, pegylated lipids, and cholesterol) at a specific ratio, each of which play a role in the stability, delivery, and efficacy of the nanoparticle. While elegant in design, similarities in the physicochemical properties of the lipids, as well as their relative abundance, require consideration when developing characterization and stability indicating methods. \n\nThe first analytical consideration to make in this regard is one about sample preparation. Ideas for sample preparation can be drawn from understanding how LNPs are formed. Ganesan and Narayanasamy have comprehensively reviewed a wide array of LNP preparation approaches [90]. Most commonly, two solutions are prepared for mixing -one is an ethanol solution of lipids and the other is an aqueous solution of mRNA. The aqueous solution is ratiometrically introduced to the ethanolic lipid solution using mixing techniques ranging from pipette aspiration to microfluidics. The assembly of the LNP can be reversed for the sake of compositional analysis. A preferred approach for this involves dissolving the particle by the addition of organic solvent. An RPLC analysis with either evaporative light scattering, charged aerosol, or mass spectrometric detection can thereafter be performed. Methanol is a commonly used organic solvent for liposome disruption where it can alter bilayer membrane structures and release the encapsulated drugs. Methanol and other organic solvents have proven to be equally effective at dissolving solid lipid nanoparticles. In fact, mixtures of chloroform and methanol and solutions containing methanol or isopropanol have also been used with success [91]. Li et al. prepared individual samples for siRNA and Fig. 8.

Currently, numerous clinical trials are being investigated using diverse applications of mRNA therapeutics for infectious diseases of viral or bacterial pathogens, for cancers, and more. 4 RNA drug product delivery in vivo is generally achieved after encapsulating mRNA in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vesicle to protect the nucleic acid cargo as it is shuttled through the cell membrane for the final translation into protein antigen. Unfortunately, this mRNA encapsulation step introduces a new analytical measurement challenge\ufffdensuring full mRNA extraction from the LNP vesicle before quantification. Encapsulation also introduces the necessity to measure mRNA quantity twice within a drug development process\ufffd within and without LNP\ufffdrequiring additional time and capabilities. Not surprisingly, extraction approaches and measurement platforms are not uniform within the mRNA community, and no shared reference material is currently available to harmonize approaches to bring measurements into concordance. \n\nTherapeutics are becoming more complex\ufffdfrom small, pure synthetic chemical derivatives to mixtures of proteins, to nucleic acid oligomers with complex structure and increased heterogeneity, and to micrometer-sized cell-based therapies. As the production of these products gets more sophisticated, establishing measurement trueness and defining traceability have become proportionately more challenging and meaningful. For mRNA therapeutics, the quantity of active substance (i.e., naked mRNA) is commonly assessed using UV spectroscopy, RT-qPCR, or RT-dPCR, whereas the drug product (LNP-mRNA) is commonly assessed by fluorescencebased assays expressed in terms of encapsulation efficiency (free mRNA/total mRNA). 5 While UV spectroscopy is both fast and inexpensive, it lacks well-defined calibration, can be nonspecific, and depends on the estimates of molar absorptivity coefficients. 6 PCR-based techniques, while specific, are limited by RNA-to-cDNA conversion efficiency and are traceable to the enzymes, primers, or initiation steps used, which may change over time or setting.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a promising delivery platform for nucleic acids, for example mRNA or siRNA, in the areas of infectious disease [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], oncology [8][9][10][11] and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [12,13]. LNPs encapsulating RNA (LNP-RNA) are formed through electrostatic capture and rapid precipitation by mixing of the payload and lipid packets comprised of cationic and neutral lipids. Various efforts have been made to study the physicochemical characteristic of the particles, such as size [14,15] and compositional heterogeneity [14], morphology [14,16,17], macromolecular structure [18] and RNA encapsulation efficiency [17,19]. Deep understanding of LNPs at the molecular level can help elucidate correlation of structure and in vitro/ in vivo performance, and develop effective manufacturing and control strategies. \n\nResearch has shown that the in vivo potency and tissue-penetrating ability of LNPs are related to particle size [20,21]. Through fractionation by semi-preparative SEC and subsequent offline size measurement of the fractionated samples by hydrodynamic light scattering (DLS), Zhang et al. studied the size dependence of LNP composition, RNA encapsulation and in vitro gene-silencing activities [15]. Their data showed correlation between the cationic polymer/RNA ratio and RNA gene-silencing potency, which highlighted the importance of size-based compositional assessment of the LNP-RNAs. \n\nAlthough semi-preparative fractionation by size with offline fraction analysis provides a viable approach to analysis of size-based compositional heterogeneity, the experiment is lengthy and laborious, and not suitable for use as a routine analytical procedure. Online analysis of the RNA payload versus size, in a single automated run, would be highly desirable.",

            "text": "Formulating lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA products is a critical step in developing mRNA-based therapeutics, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies. LNPs are lipidbased nanoparticles that encapsulate mRNA molecules, protect them from degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and enable efficient mRNA delivery into cells. The formulation of LNP mRNA products involves several key components and steps. \n\nLipid selection: The choice of lipids is a crucial factor in LNP formulation. Different lipids with varying properties, such as cationic, ionizable, and PEGylated lipids, can form LNPs with distinct characteristics. For example, cationic lipids provide a positive charge to LNPs, enhancing cellular uptake, while ionizable lipids allow for the efficient release of mRNA within cells. In addition, PEGylated lipids can improve the stability and pharmacokinetics of LNPs. mRNA encapsulation: The mRNA molecule carries the genetic information to be delivered into cells and is encapsulated within LNPs. mRNA is complexed with the lipids through electrostatic interactions, forming a lipid-mRNA complex that protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation in the extracellular environment. \n\nFormulation optimization: The formulation of LNPs is optimized to achieve desired characteristics, such as particle size, charge, and stability. Particle size is an important parameter that affects cellular uptake, biodistribution, and immune response. The surface charge of LNPs can also be controlled by adjusting the composition and ratio of lipids, which can influence their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. \n\nSterilization and quality control: To ensure product safety, LNPs intended for clinical use must be manufactured under sterile conditions. Sterilization methods, such as filtration or gamma irradiation, may be used to eliminate potential contaminants. In addition, quality control tests, including particle size analysis, encapsulation efficiency, and endotoxin testing, are performed to ensure the quality and consistency of LNP mRNA products. \n\nStorage and stability: LNPs are typically stored at low temperatures, such as \u221220 \u2022 C or \u221280 \u2022 C, to maintain stability and prevent degradation.",

            "text": "A schematic representation of a four-component lipid nanoparticle is provided in Fig. 2. \n\nThe use of LNP mRNA has proven to be highly effective for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but therapeutic applications expand well beyond just vaccines [8]. In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.",

            "text": "The siRNA-LNPs formulation of Onpattro (Patisaran) has a shelf life of three years at 2-8 \u2022 C [26]. Research by Ball et al. using ionizable cationic lipid 306O 13 as a replacement for DLin-MC3-DMA in the formulation indicates that, under aqueous conditions, the formulation remains stable for 156 days at 2 \u2022 C and pH 7, with no significant changes in particle size or siRNA encapsulation efficiency [13]. This suggests that the stability of mRNA, rather than LNPs, determines the storage conditions and shelf life of mRNA-LNP vaccines. The method of lipid encapsulation of nucleic acids not only determines the degree of protection against nucleic acid degradation but also influences how the nucleic acids escape from endosomes following the fusion of nanoparticles with the endosomal membrane. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron microscopy (EM) experiments reveal that LNPs exhibit varying numbers of layered structures, with lipid bilayers separated by acid-rich regions [27][28][29]. The internal composition of LNPs is predominantly lipid, although some research data suggest the presence of a certain degree of water [27]. This implies that, even when mRNA is encapsulated, it may still be partially exposed to the aqueous environment. This conclusion is supported not only by previous low-temperature transmission electron microscopy results of siRNA-LNPs [30], but also by similar observations of electron-dense cores in mRNA-LNPs [4]. \n\nIn recent years, although extensive research has been conducted on mRNA-LNPs (lipid nanoparticles), two important scientific issues remain unresolved. For instance, the composition and structure of mRNA-LNPs are still a matter of debate, and the encapsulation mechanism of mRNA is not yet fully understood. Investigating the microscopic dynamics during the preparation of mRNA-LNPs can aid in the optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations and improve mRNA delivery efficiency.",

As a result, many products are currently being developed in this space. Critically, well\u2010characterized and appropriately designed assays are required to monitor purity and integrity in order to maintain the efficacy and consistency of these novel products. Currently, capillary gel electrophoresis with laser\u2010induced fluorescence (CGE\u2010LIF) and ion\u2010pair reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography (IP\u2010RPLC) are techniques of choice for mRNA integrity analysis. However, most methods proposed for biotherapeutic analysis have been developed using naked mRNA without LNP components or proprietary buffer formulations, which can obscure undiscovered impurities or complex interactions between mRNA and the sample matrix. In this study, we addressed these methodological challenges by using a biotherapeutically relevant commercial mRNA\u2010LNP sample (approx. 4200 b) to refine and optimize a customizable CGE\u2010LIF method currently under consideration for mRNA\u2010LNP biotherapeutic analysis. We systematically characterized how critical method parameters\u2014such as denaturant type, concentration, and usage\u2014and LNP disruption protocols can interfere with accurate mRNA integrity analysis in CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC. We found that optimal conditions for CGE\u2010LIF assay sensitivity, variability, and resolution included sample precipitation by isopropanol, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of dye. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of both CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC are highlighted, and a discussion of key considerations when using or designing methods for mRNA integrity assessment is presented.",

To determine the encapsulation efficiency, the percentages of encapsulated RNA were determined by detecting the RNA concentrations of both outside and inside the LNP using Quant-iT TM RiboGreen R RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNA/LNP samples were diluted in TE buffer prior to addition of the dye, and the RNA concentrations outside the LNP were determined by detecting the fluorescence with a microplate reader (BioTek, USA). Afterward, the total RNA concentrations, including the RNA outside and inside LNPs, were obtained after the lipid membranes were breached using Triton X-100. To evaluate RNase protection of the encapsulated RNA, the RNA/LNP samples were treated with RNase A (Invitrogen, USA) for 30 min. After RNase inactivation with proteinase K (Invitrogen, USA), RNA was extracted and denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was performed.",

The method utilizes a standard SEC-MALS-UV-dRI system and is implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis module of ASTRA software. The calculated RNA wt % results from four LNPs, made with different types of PEG-lipids and compositional ratios, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by and fractionation with offline RPLC analysis. This work indicates that the correction of the scattering contribution to the UV signal implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis algorithm was adequate for reliable sizedependent RNA content analysis of lipid nanoparticles. Based on these results, we conclude that the online method is, in all likelihood, suitable for rapid and facile determination of the sized-dependent payload distribution of other LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, or other carriers constructed from excipients that do not absorb UV at the characteristic absorption wavelength of the payload. The analytical advancement reported here provides additional characterization information, and potentially sheds light on understanding the therapeutic outcome of the RNA/DNA filled LNPs. We foresee the potential for use in quality control procedures, to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which would constitute a critical quality attribute of a therapeutic LNP-RNA product.",

            "text": "Two imaged capillary isoelectric focusing methods were developed to provide insight into the quality and stability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, specifically, mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). A variety of stressed and lipid composition\u2010modified samples were measured and detected by their UV absorption. The results were supported by the data of an encapsulation assay and particle sizing. One method, using 9 M urea as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape offers detailed information. The summed peak area of both peaks showed RSDs from 2% to 8% when one batch was measured in triplicate and apparently depends on the size of the LNPs. In the second method, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N\u2010ethylurea was used. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the isoelectric point (pI, <0.5%). The repeatable peak area (RSD of 2%\u20137%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, which also applies to the first method, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Furthermore, experiments with the addition of a fluorescent dye were performed (fluorescence detection), which tremendously increased the sensitivity of the methods. Both methods can be used to characterize the stability of mRNA\u2010loaded LNPs, for example, when investigating various storage times at different temperatures and freeze\u2013thaw cycles, as well as the ability of the methods to distinguish lipid compositions and measure batch\u2010to\u2010batch variability.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a key platform for delivering mRNA vaccines and therapeutics with numerous innovative drugs under development. However, characterizing these complex and unstable products remains challenging. Developing fast, reliable methods to assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mRNA component is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) might offer a promising solution to address this need. Due to the presence of high concentrations of organic solvent and the possibility to work at elevated temperatures, HILIC might enable on-column disruption of LNPs while preserving the full integrity of the mRNA payload, facilitating a streamlined characterization process. To evaluate this, we developed two proof of concept HILIC methods. The first one disrupts LNPs and retains the mRNA payload using a high percentage of organic solvent and elevated temperatures. The second one, relying on milder conditions, retains only the unencapsulated mRNA, which can be used to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency. Both methods were used on Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines and on Sanofi\u2019s in-development mRNA product as model samples. Our preliminary findings suggest that HILIC holds potential for online LNP disruption, mRNA integrity assessment, and encapsulation efficiency analysis. They also highlight the limitations of small-pore-sized columns currently available on the market.",

Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control. We hope each of the above topics have shed light on some of the very important ways in which LC-based methods have aided the development of the first generation of LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals. New progress on analytical tools for LNP mRNA are bound to be realized along with further clinical success, and the field of separation science appears to be at the heart of future efforts.",

Given that mRNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) are held together by an intricate ensemble of weak forces, there are some intriguing parallels to biologic drugs, at least at first glance. However, mRNA vaccines are not without unique formulation and stabilization challenges derived from the instability of unmodified mRNA and its limited history as a drug or vaccine. Since certain learning gained from biologic drug development may be applicable for the improvement of mRNA vaccines, we present a perspective on parallels and contrasts between the emerging role of higher-order structure pertaining to mRNA-LNPs compared to pharmaceutical proteins. In a recent publication, the location of mRNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles was identified, revealing new insights into the LNP structure, nanoheterogeneity, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA molecules [Brader et al. Biophys. J.2021, 120, 276633773963]. We extend those findings by considering the effect of encapsulation on mRNA thermal unfolding with the observation that encapsulation in LNPs increases mRNA unfolding temperatures.",

LNP stability and bilayer fluidity are determined by the identities and the amounts of the various lipids employed in the formulation and LNP efficacy is determined in large part by the lipid composition which usually contains a cationic lipid, a PEG\u2010lipid conjugate, cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid. Analytical methods developed for LNP characterization must be able to determine not only the identity and content of each individual lipid component (i.e., the parent lipids), but also the associated impurities and degradants. In this work, we describe an efficient and sensitive reversed\u2010phase chromatographic method with charged aerosol detection (CAD) suitable for this purpose. Sample preparation diluent and mobile phase pH conditions are critical and have been optimized for the lipids of interest. This method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity for lipid analysis to support process and formulation development for new drugs and vaccines.",

However, they pose significant manufacturing and analytical challenges due to their intrinsic structural complexity. During product development and process control, their design, characterization, and quality control require the combination of fit-for-purpose complementary analytical tools. Moreover, an in-depth methodological expertise and holistic approach to data analysis are required for robust measurements and to enable an adequate interpretation of experimental findings. Here the combination of complementary label-free biophysical techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle-DLS (MADLS), Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), multiple detection SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been successfully used for the characterization of physical and chemical attributes of rAAV and LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Methods\u2019 performance, applicability, dynamic range of detection and method optimization are discussed for the measurements of multiple critical physical\u2212chemical quality attributes, including particle size distribution, aggregation propensity, polydispersity, particle concentration, particle structural properties and nucleic acid payload.",

            "text": "Single-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.",

Interestingly, Gao et al. used computational methods to design optimized siRNA-LNP formulations and found that nanoparticles formed with an N/P ratio of 6 had a larger volume. We speculate that the smaller volume observed in Gao et al.'s study with an N/P ratio of 3 could be due to an insufficient number of lipid components, which may have been a major factor influencing nanoparticle size [42]. Additionally, J\u00fcrgens et al. evaluated the properties and efficiency of siRNA and mRNA LNPs, and their particle size data indicate that siRNA-LNPs with an N/P ratio of 3:1 had a larger diameter compared with mRNA-LNPs with an N/P ratio of 6:1 [43], which aligns with our findings. \n\nFor the core clusters of the six systems at 300 ns, their radius of gyration (Rg), volume, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and density were calculated (see Table 2). The radius of gyration and volume of the LNP_HAc_DNA and LNP_CA_DNA systems were 3.88/4.25 nm and 311.04/402.03 nm 3 , respectively, with densities of 703.20 g/L and 687.03 g/L.

            "text": "Based on comparative MD simulations of six systems (LNP, LNP_HAc, LNP_HAc_DNA, LNP_HAc_2DNA, LNP_CA_DNA, and LNP_CA_2DNA), the structural characteristics of mRNA-LNPs have been detailed, shedding light on the potential mechanisms for mRNA encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) used in mRNA vaccines. This study specifically analyzes the effects of different N/P ratios and types of acidic environments on the formation of mRNA nanoparticles. The findings indicate that, under neutral conditions, lipid components self-assemble into nanoparticles, with ionizable lipids predominantly residing in the core of the lipid nanoparticles. When mixed with nucleic acids in an acidic environment, ionizable lipids undergo protonation, causing a redistribution of lipids that leads to the disintegration of the nanoparticles. The electrostatic interactions drive the encapsulation of mRNA, while protonated nitrogen atoms in ionizable lipids form stable hydrogen bonds with mRNA, ensuring the structural stability of the mRNA-LNP complexes. Radial distribution analysis of the mRNA-LNP components reveals that the distribution of the four lipid components within the nanoparticles follows a sequence from the outer layer to the core, as follows: DMG-PEG 2000, DSPC, cholesterol, and SM-102 (protonated). Additionally, mRNA-LNP clusters formed at lower N/P ratios exhibit larger volumes, higher densities, and greater uniformity. The type of acidic environment also affects the formation of mRNA-LNP clusters; citric acid environments are more favorable for forming larger, more uniform clusters with a looser internal structure compared to acetic acid. \n\nIn summary, the simulation results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of mRNA-LNPs formulations and for enhancing vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "PyMOL is a widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool that plays a critical role in designing and optimizing mRNA-LNP vaccines. This software enables researchers to create highresolution, 3D representations of molecular structures, providing deep insights into the interactions between lipids, mRNA, and cellular membranes (Rigsby and Parker, 2016). The ability to visually manipulate and analyze the structures at the atomic level makes PyMOL an invaluable tool for optimizing LNP formulations (Mooers, 2020;Mart\u0131-Centelles et al., 2024). \n\nPyMOL helps researchers build and visualize the threedimensional structures of LNPs. By displaying how lipids are arranged within the nanoparticle, PyMOL allows for detailed structural analysis, including the packing of lipids in the bilayer (Wang and Deserno, 2010). This visualization aids in understanding how changes in lipid composition impact the overall stability and encapsulation efficiency of mRNA. By adjusting parameters like lipid chain length, headgroup types, and ionizable lipids, researchers can explore how these factors influence the structural integrity of LNPs and their ability to encapsulate mRNA efficiently. \n\nPyMOL, using the molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP), a well-established method to calculate and visualize lipophilicity in molecules, allows researchers to observe interactions between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of lipids and the charged and polar components of mRNA. By modeling these interactions, PyMOL helps identify optimal lipid compositions that improve mRNA encapsulation and stability, ensuring that the mRNA remains protected during delivery and is efficiently released once the LNP reaches its target cells (Oberhauser et al., 2014). \n\nOne of the critical steps in LNP design is the selection of the appropriate lipid mixture. PyMOL provides a platform to examine how varying lipid components-such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and ionizable lipids-affect the structural and functional properties of LNPs Seeliger and de Groot, 2010.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.",

            "text": "Rational design and robust formulation processes are critical for optimal delivery of mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.",

            "text": "Post-manufacture monitoring of LNPs is essential for ensuring the stability and efficacy of LNP-based formulations. While CQAs such as particle size play a crucial role in formulation performance, assessing the integrity of the lipid and payload components is equally important. To achieve this, in addition to testing in vitro and in vivo efficacy, a cell-free protein expression system was employed to evaluate mRNA expression levels following extraction from LNPs, while HPLC-ELSD analysis was used to assess lipid integrity and ensure high lipid recovery (Figure 4). cell-free protein expression system was employed to evaluate mRNA expression levels following extraction from LNPs, while HPLC-ELSD analysis was used to assess lipid integrity and ensure high lipid recovery (Figure 4). Regardless of the manufacturing method used for LNPs, all formulations had total recoveries greater than 75%, with individual lipid recoveries ranging between 73 and 100% (Figure 4a), and all formulations resulted in mass ratios similar to the expected mass ratio-varying with <2% error across lipids (Figure 4b). This ensures that, although some product loss is inevitable, it occurs at the same rate across all lipid components. Unequal loss, particularly of critical components such as the ionizable lipid, could significantly compromise LNP functionality. Finally, extracted mRNA from the formulations was then used to treat CFPE systems at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, and this showed similar results to in vitro testing with no significant differences in expression levels (Figure 4c). These results confirm that low-cost microfluidic mixers do not compromise the integrity or functionality of LNPs.

            "text": "Ionizable lipid-based LNPs were formulated using a microfluidic mixing device, following a previously established protocol [38 ]. The formulation comprised ionizable lipid, helper lipid (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid conjugate (DMG-PEG20 0 0) with a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (Fig. 1 B) [38 ]. We used Firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA to   measure the efficiency of in vitro and in vivo delivery [38 ,40 ]. We examined various weight ratios of ionizable lipid to mRNA ranging from 2:1 to 20:1. The encapsulation efficiency and drug (mRNA) loading capacity are used as important criteria for evaluating the quality of LNPs. Encapsulation efficiency signifies the ratio of RNA enclosed within lipid nanoparticles to the total RNA within the LNP solution, whereas a high encapsulation efficiency indicates a low presence of free mRNA in the prepared LNP solution. On the other hand, drug loading efficiency measures the proportion of RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles concerning the RNA input during the preparation process. Consequently, a high drug loading efficiency reflects a relatively minor loss of mRNA in LNP throughout the preparation process. At ionizable lipid to mRNA weight ratios exceeding 2:1, the encapsulation efficiency of LNPs generated from three HTO lipids and SM-102 all surpassed 70% (Fig. 1 C). Notably, the drug (mRNA) loading efficiency of HTO LNP is superior to that of SM-102 (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, it was observed that LNPs exhibited negative surface charges at neutral pH, potentially due to the presence of negatively charged mRNA molecules ( Table S1) [18 ,41 ]. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the presence of more hydroxyl groups in HTO lipids could form more hydrogen bonds with mRNA than SM-102 (Fig. 1 E and F). These interactions may enhance the binding affinity between lipid and mRNA, thereby reducing the loss of mRNA during LNP preparation.",

            "text": "The FDA has published a 'Guidance for industry for liposome drug products' in 2018 83 but a similar document that is directly applicable to RNA-LNP drug products is not yet available. Prior to the approval of the mRNA vaccines, the only documented example was the registration of Onpattro \u00d2 , the first LNP-siRNA product approved. 84 The major differences between liposomal drug products and RNA-LNPs (both siRNA and mRNA) are the internal structure of the particle and the complexity of the API. As discussed before, for the mRNA-LNP products, analytical methods related to the possible interaction of the ionizable lipid and the API were requested. In addition, FDA and EMA guidelines state that for the characterization of novel excipients such as ionizable lipids or novel PEG-lipids, the level of detail provided in the submission should be comparable to that for a drug substance. 85,86 or determination of the purity and stability of lipids in the LNP, methods based on LC with CAD (charged aerosol detection) are most common, as the lipid components tend to lack a UV chromophore. Chromatographic conditions can be chosen such that the four main lipid components and their degradation products are separated. 87 he work by Kinsey et al. also includes an example of how stress testing, or a forced degradation study could be conducted for the lipid components. For detailed characterization of lipid impurities and lipid degradation products, additional analytical detection techniques based on mass spectrometry are required. 88 The identification and quantification of secondary oxidation degradation products of the lipids by LC-MS methods has been described by Abeyrathne et al. 89 For measurement of hydroperoxide levels in the lipids, methods based on iodometric titration, UV spectroscopy, chromatography, among other techniques, have been summarized. 90 ethods for the detailed characterization of the proprietary lipid components and their oxidation/degradation products are still emerging. Recently, an application note was published describing the use of electron-activated dissociation (EAD) to distinguish the oxidative impurities from ionizable lipids with great resolution and sensitivity. 73",

            "text": "Genetic therapies derived from interfering RNA (siRNA), mRNA, and plasmid DNA can potentially treat many diseases [1]. However, the immune system can rapidly degrade naked DNA and RNA. Encapsulating DNA or RNA molecules into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is a method of overcoming this problem [2]. Encapsulating RNA into LNPs also prevents cleavage by RNase in the blood [3]. Research has shown that LNPs effectively transport genetic material into target cells, both for siRNA and mRNA [4]. Furthermore, LNP is a key technology behind the success stories of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines [5]. \n\nThe LNP structure usually consists of ionizable lipids, structural lipids, and cholesterol. The ionizable lipids have positive charges at low pH and are neutral at the physiological pH. This characteristic of ionizable lipids increases LNP biocompatibility, which is beneficial for genetic drug delivery [2]. Structural lipids play a role in the stability of LNPs, while cholesterol is involved in the intracellular delivery of LNPs [6]. Moreover, cholesterol can maintain the integrity of the LNP structure [7]. LNPs also contain a small amount of DMG-PEG2000 to prevent aggregation [8]. \n\nLNPs were produced by combining nucleic acid with an acidic aqueous buffer and lipid excipients in ethanol, which has the advantage of low toxicity compared to other lipid solvents [9]. Once the LNPs are formed, ethanol must be removed promptly to maintain the integrity of the LNPs. A study by Kimura and coworkers [10] has revealed that post-treatment with ethanol dialysis can stabilize the LNP structure since ethanol can destabilize the lipid membrane. However, the mechanism at the molecular level remains to be determined, and research related to the molecular mechanism of LNPs requires extensive resources and time. \n\nMD simulations have been used to investigate the behavior of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in drug delivery applications, emphasizing their potential for optimizing LNP designs [11].",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

Intriguingly, mRNA-LNPs are known to form both spherical and highly nonspherical morphologies (9,11,16,18,19), but the origins and practical implications of these morphological variants SIGNIFICANCE The clinical utility of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines delivered in lipid nanoparticles has recently been highlighted by their use in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). The lipid nanoparticle is a complex entity in terms of structural and physical attributes that influence biological efficacy and pharmaceutics. One of the most fundamental yet elusive questions has been the nature and location of the mRNA payload inside the lipid nanoparticle. Elucidating this detail via direct experimental methods has been a major objective in the field of RNA delivery. Here, we show that a combination of dye-binding and cryo-electron microscopy pinpoints the mRNA location, providing new insights into its encapsulation state and chemical microenvironment. remain unclear. Molecular simulation studies (20) indicate that the LNP structure may involve solvent pockets, and experimental studies have shown nonspherical morphologies to be associated with segregation of the bilayer-forming 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) component, resulting in pronounced blebs (11). Despite significant efforts to pinpoint the nucleic acid payload, the precise location of mRNA molecules within LNPs has not heretofore been unambiguously identified via direct experimental methods.\n\nOne difficulty with the analysis of LNPs is that many biophysical techniques produce a globally averaged signal or have limited selectivity for the RNA molecule within the solid particle. Although cryo-EM is a powerful tool for visualizing LNPs, the mass density contrast alone is not distinctive enough to unambiguously resolve RNA from lipidic components. To overcome these limitations, we explored the concept of using an RNA-binding dye to",

            "text": "There is considerable interest in using messenger RNA (mRNA) for vaccine and therapeutic applications (1)(2)(3)(4). A major challenge with this concept is achieving efficient delivery of mRNA into cells where it can affect expression of the desired protein or, in the case of vaccines, a diseasespecific antigen protein. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as the most promising nonviral delivery vehicle for exogenous mRNA (5,6). The LNP is a complex nanostructured entity that serves to protect the delicate RNA molecule from the harshly degrading nuclease environment in vivo while facilitating intracellular delivery. It comprises several lipid components, including an ionizable lipid that plays a central role in delivery efficacy (7)(8)(9). Entrapment of RNA is achieved by combining RNA with lipids at an acidic pH (10) at which the ionizable lipid is positively charged, thus ensuring a charge-driven interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acid. After a period of maturation, pH adjustment above the pKa of the ionizable lipid results in a near-neutral surface charge desirable for clinical administration (10). The incorporation of a pegylated lipid achieves a sterically stabilized core shell nanoparticle. Thus, the internal and external molecular architectures are both implicated in influencing biological activity and pharmaceutics. Although it is clear that the different lipids are not distributed uniformly throughout the LNP, details of the assembly and internal structure remain unsettled, especially in the case of mRNA, for which various models have been proposed and continue to be debated (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). In the case of LNPs containing short interfering RNA (siRNA), small angle xray scattering and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data have been interpreted as evidence of a multilamellar structure in which the siRNA molecule is sandwiched between bilayer lipid assemblies (10,17). However, the situation is less clear when LNPs containing the much larger mRNA molecule are also considered.

This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. \n\nLNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19].",

            "text": "When the dye binds to nucleic acids, its fluorescence increases proportionally and can be used to detect the concentration of mRNA encapsulated in the LNPs. Due to the nature of LNPs, it is possible to see some mRNA grafted on the outer part of the vesicles: of course, this mRNA will not be functional due to exposure to the outer side of the vesicles. To remove unencapsulated mRNA (both the one released after dialysis and the one grafted outside the LNPs) from the quantification, the signal from intact LNPs was subtracted from the signal obtained from burst LNPs. LNP samples were first diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer, followed by 50 \u03bcL of each diluted sample added to either 50 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 TE buffer or 100 \u03bcL of 2% Triton-X in 1\u00d7 TE buffer (this step ensures bursting of LNPs). RNA standard curve, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, was prepared using a combination of 2% Triton-X 100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer and 1\u00d7 TE buffer as the diluent. All samples were run in duplicate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. Ribogreen reagent was diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer with 100 \u03bcL added to each well. Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, the plate was read at E x /E m of 480 nm/520 nm. \n\nThe stability of the encapsulated mRNA was assessed for 28 days postsynthesis. First, the RNA was extracted from LNPs by using a lithium chloride precipitation method to evaluate mRNA integrity. Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of empty or loaded LNPs were mixed with 300 \u03bcL of lithium chloride in pure ethanol (34 mg/mL solution). The solution was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min (4 \u00b0C). After the supernatant was removed, the pellet was dissolved in 500 \u03bcL of 70% ethanol in RNasefree water, and another centrifugation (12,000g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) step followed.",

            "text": "Lipid materials, owing to their lipophilic properties, facilitate efficient delivery within the body. Unlike conventional liposomes, which are spherical structures composed of a phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic interiors housing nucleic acids [38], current lipid nanocarriers exhibit a more focused approach. Liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) share similarities in their design, but they differ in their composition and function. Both are lipid-based nanoformulations and are excellent drug delivery vehicles, transporting their cargo within a protective, outer layer of lipids. However, LNPs can take on various forms. LNPs are similar to liposomes, but they are specifically designed to encapsulate a wide range of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). As a result, LNPs have become the most popular non-viral gene delivery system. Companies such as Exelead develop and manufacture LNPs to encapsulate different types of genetic payloads, including siRNA, mRNA, and saRNA. Traditional liposomes typically have one or more rings of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous pocket, but not all LNPs have a continuous bilayer structure that would qualify them as lipid vesicles or liposomes. Some LNPs assume a micellar structure, encapsulating drug molecules in a non-aqueous core. An additional lipid aids in accelerating the structural transformation of LNPs within cells, facilitating drug release. Meanwhile, the outer layer is often coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids to reinforce colloidal stability and prevent protein absorption or aggregation in circulation, thus mitigating immune clearance [30]. In addition, delivery systems for RNA delivery via anionic or zwitterionic liposomes have also emerged. Studies by Siddhesh D Patil et al. have shown that the transfection efficiency of some anionic liposomes is similar to that of cationic liposomes, while their toxicity is significantly lower [39]. The preparation process of LNPs can be more conveniently adjusted in size to adapt to more functions under novel methods such as microfluidic (Figure 2A).",

This study aims to explore the mechanisms by which LNPs encapsulate mRNA, as well as the effects of different N/P ratios and acid types in nucleic acid solutions on the structure and properties of LNPs, using the ethanol solvent injection method as the encapsulation technique. Six systems were designed, based on the composition and proportions of the existing mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the self-assembly process of LNPs. Ethanol was used as a solvent instead of pure water to better mimic experimental conditions. The results indicate that lipid components self-assemble into nanoparticles under neutral conditions, with the ionizable lipid SM-102 predominantly concentrating in the core of the particles. Upon mixing with nucleic acids in acidic conditions, LNPs undergo disassembly, during which protonated SM-102 encapsulates mRNA through electrostatic interactions, forming stable hydrogen bonds. Cluster structure analysis revealed that the four lipid components of LNPs are distributed sequentially from the outside inwards as DMG-PEG 2000, DSPC, cholesterol, and protonated SM-102. Moreover, LNPs constructed under low pH or low N/P ratios using citric acid exhibited larger volumes and more uniform distribution. These findings provide a scientific basis for further designing and optimizing LNP components to enhance the efficacy of mRNA vaccine encapsulation.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach to delivering mRNA molecules, enabling the development of mRNA-based therapeutics such as vaccines and gene therapies. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, offer unique advantages for mRNA delivery, such as protection from enzymatic degradation, improved cellular uptake, enhanced intracellular trafficking, and the controlled release of mRNA. Here, we discuss the role of nanotechnology in mRNA delivery and its potential applications. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs): LNPs are one of the most-used nanocarriers for mRNA delivery. They comprise lipids that can self-assemble into nanoparticles, encapsulating mRNA within their lipid bilayers. LNPs can protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake through endocytosis, and promote endosomal escape, allowing mRNA to reach the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into protein. LNPs have been successfully used for the delivery of mRNA in mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as well as for mRNA-based gene therapies for genetic disorders. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles: Polymeric nanoparticles are another type of nanocarrier that can be used for mRNA delivery. These nanoparticles are typically composed of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate mRNA within their matrix or conjugate mRNA onto their surface, providing protection and stability to mRNA during delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles can also be engineered to have specific surface properties, such as charge and size, to optimize the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of mRNA. \n\nInorganic nanoparticles: Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold and silica nanoparticles, have also been explored for mRNA delivery.",

            "text": "However, these techniques are not quantitative by nature, have limited throughput, or suffer from measurement challenges. 11 There is an unmet analytical need for methods that look specifically at LNP-mRNA aggregation assemblies and potentially even the encapsulation of aggregated mRNA as cargo. It is impossible to know the impact of such alternative forms on the DP efficacy and safety without an analytical method capable of distinguishing ultrahigh molecular weight forms. It is also important that the analytical method preserves the alternative forms during analysis. \n\nThe public assessment reports by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) list the specifications of the Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Spikevax (Moderna) vaccines. 7,8 Metrics include the DP size determination by DLS and purity/integrity determination by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) or CGE. The purity determination method by RP-HPLC typically involves a high column temperature and the use of an ion-pairing agent in combination with an organic solvent. 12 he integrity determination of mRNA by CGE involves the use of high amounts of a denaturing agent, i.e., 4\u22128 M urea or formamide under nonaqueous conditions. 13,14 In both methods, the harsh denaturing conditions used prevent detection of noncovalent aggregates. \n\nThe sizes of mRNA and LNP are usually between 100 and 500 \u00c5 15,16 and between 600 and 1000 \u00c5, 17 respectively. The large size requires the use of SEC columns with ultrawide pores, which pose heightened challenges with regard to column particle stability. The stability of a packed bed strongly depends on the average pore diameter and has to be carefully considered when large pore particles are packed. 18 The Zenix SEC-300 column (300 \u00c5 pore size) and SRT SEC-1000 column (1000 \u00c5 pore size) are indicated for the determination of mRNA aggregates. 14 However, aggregates of mRNA and LNPs would be unlikely to be chromatographically resolved on these columns, given that they are larger than both of these pore sizes.",

Lipid nanoparticles have three common purposes: delivery, self\u2010adjuvanting properties, and mRNA protection. Faster vaccine development requires an efficient and fast assay to monitor mRNA purity and integrity. Microchip CE is known to be a robust technology that is capable of rapid separation. Here, we describe the development and optimization of a purity and integrity assay for mRNA\u2010based vaccines encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles using commercial microchip\u2010based separation.

In addition, LNPs are lipid-based spherical vesicles and can self-assemble into precise structures like cell membranes. 164 Furthermore, LNPs are lipid-based, and nanoscale carriers that can effectively transfer mRNA intracellularly and safeguard it from RNAase during systemic circulation. 165 7][168][169] (Figure 2) \n\nModifying the lipid structure 130 and particle surface has been regarded as a strategy to increase the efficient delivery of mRNA into the cytosol. 14,170 It was discovered that LNPs having multilamellar, faceted, and lamellar lipid phases have better mRNA transfection effectiveness. 171,172 N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), for example, was a first-generation permanently charged lipid that was toxic, 173 subpar, and relied on nonscalable methods.

            "text": "EVAnalyzer was primarily developed for EV research, however, is inherently applicable also for other types of nanoparticles as long they can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. A prototypical application area is the LNP (lipid-based nanoparticle) field, which has gained substantial momentum after the successful development and global application of LNP formulated mRNA vaccines for Covid19 (Baden et al., 2020). RNA encapsulation efficiencies by empty LNPs are typically determined indirectly such as by non-membrane permeable RNA intercalating dyes (Huang et al., 2022;Michel et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2008), or fractions of RNA co-isolating with liposomes, quantified by RT-qPCR (Saha et al., 2018;Tsuji et al., 2016). We reasoned that quantitative single particle imaging enabled by EVAnalyzer might provide a straightforward and direct method to characterise RNA encapsulation at the single particle level. To test this, fluorescently labelled LNPs were prepared with Cy5-DOPE (DODAG/DOPE/Cholesterol/CPA/Cy5-DOPE = 20:49.5:20:10:0.5 m/m/m/m/m) and used either empty or for encapsulation of AlexaFluor488-siRNA at a final mol charge ratio of 6:1 (ratio of positive charges of cationic lipids to negative charges of siRNAs, Figure 9a). NTA, light scattering and cryo-TEM analyses confirmed formation of spherical LNPs for both samples. LNPs with fluorescent siRNA showed a mean particle size of 154.6 \u00b1 3.2 nm, a surface \u03b6-potential of 45.6 \u00b1 2.0 mV and a polydispersity index (PdI) of 0.136 \u00b1 0, while for empty LNPs we measured a mean particle size of 124.5 \u00b1 2.5 nm, a surface \u03b6-potential of 43.8 \u00b1 2.2 mV and a PdI of 0.115 \u00b1 0.00+ (Supplementary Figure 3a and S3b).",

            "text": "RNA-based therapeutics are gaining traction as exemplified by the current vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that utilize mRNA technology. However, delivery of RNA has proven difficult as naked RNA is rapidly degraded when administered necessitating vector-based methods. Dr. Kalina Paunovska (Georgia Institute of Technology) has been studying the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the delivery of RNA therapeutics. LNPs consist of a lipid bilayer containing phospholipids, cholesterol, PEG lipids, and ionizable fatty acids surrounding a core of genetic material such as RNA. These LNPs may also form multi-laminar bodies composed of concentric spheres with alternating layers of lipids and RNA. Each of the constituents of LNPs may be altered to improve the efficiency of delivery. However, due to the massive number of possible combinations of lipid components and RNA, LNPs are often screened in vitro with only a few hits being carried forward to in vivo studies. Furthermore, delivery of LNPs may be affected by factors not captured in in vitro models such as immunogenicity, extracellular matrix penetration, and non-target tissue distribution.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, Dr. Paunovska has developed a novel method for high throughput screening of LNPs in vivo. Joint Rapid DNA Analysis of Nanoparticles (JORDAN) utilizes DNA barcoding to label pooled LNPs prior to administration into mice (Paunovska et al., 2018a). Tissue samples are then harvested and sequenced for the barcodes to identify LNPs that were taken up efficiently by the target tissue. Using this method, Dr. Paunovska found that cholesterol esters delivered LNPs better than oxidized cholesterols in mice. This finding may be used to design high fidelity LNPs for therapeutic delivery in the future (Paunovska et al., 2018b).\n\nWhile JORDAN identifies LNPs that reach target tissues, it does not distinguish between LNPs that efficiently deliver their payload to the cytosol of cells within the target tissue versus LNPs that bind to the cell surface or are trapped within endosomes. To screen for functional delivery, Dr. Paunovska established a new method",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a type of nanocarrier system used for the delivery of small molecules, siRNA drugs, and mRNA (Baden et al. 2021). Their prevalence and use in the drug industry greatly increased following the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Hou et al. 2021). This has led to great interest in RNA-LNP delivery systems. \n\nNaked RNA is a hydrophilic, negatively charged molecule that is naturally degraded in extracellular space by RNases. Therefore, the challenge in designing a complementary LNP is one that balances these properties and protects the mRNA molecule from degradation, yet promotes delivery to cells via endocytosis (Eygeris et al. 2021). This effect is achieved by combing a mixture of lipids. An ionizable lipid or cationic lipid is one key ingredient. It balances the negative charge and independently forms an encapsulated complex with the negatively charged RNA molecule (Hajj and Whitehead 2017). LNPs also destabilizes the endosome membrane and are neutral at physiological pH to minimize toxicity (Han et al. 2021, Sun andLu 2023). Poly(ethylene glycol)anchored lipids shield the surface of the nanoparticle from charge to reduce cytotoxicity (Meng et al. 2021). Helper lipids are added to promote the fusion of nanoparticles with cell membranes (i.e. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DSPC). Cholesterol fills in the gap between the other lipids for vesicle stability (Kim et al. 2021). \n\nLNP success is defined by its transfection efficiency (TE), the ability of the LNP-mRNA complex to deliver the mRNA transcript to the target cell and induce the expression of the respective protein. TE is quantified by a proxy measurement of relative expression of a reporter gene such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or erythropoietin (Dara et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2021, Curtis et al. 2023).",

            "text": "In recent years, advances in field of nanotechnology have demonstrated potential for precision medicine. For instance, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be used for the targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules, increasing their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties beyond the Lipinski rules (1). Indeed, the development of nucleic acid therapeutics has long been hampered by the inherent hydrophilic nature, large size, and poor membrane permeability of nucleic acids (2). LNPs can be a potent alternative to viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, with an extensive range of applications such as RNA interference (RNAi) therapy or RNA-based vaccines through intracellular delivery, respectively, of short interfering RNA (siRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) (3).\n\nOne of the primary advantages associated with LNPs is their biocompatibility that enables their use in vivo for human therapy (4,5). LNPs are made of two major components: a lipid phase and a water phase containing surfactants. LNPs are generally divided into liposomes with an aqueous core or other LNPs; the latter could be solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with a solid core and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) featuring a core that is a mixture of solid and molten lipids (6). This subclass of LNPs was initially designed to improve the colloidal stability of lipid carriers and increase the drug payload into the core by controlling the release profile (7). Moreover, they are considered advantageous because their manufacturing processes can be easily scaled up for large production (8).\n\nDue to the nature of their lipid core, these particles are not well adapted for nucleic acid encapsulation. The loading of biomacromolecules such as siRNA or mRNA, therefore, occurs through the association with their shell either by chemical modifications of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) residues (9) or by incorporation of cationic lipids at the level of phospholipid monolayer, thus allowing electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids (9)(10)(11)(12). The most chosen cationic lipids are quaternised cat",

Due to the labile nature of mRNA, identifying impurities that could affect product stability and efficacy is crucial to the long-term use of nucleic-acid based medicines. Herein, reversed-phase ion pair high performance liquid chromatography (RP-IP HPLC) was used to identify a class of impurity formed through lipid:mRNA reactions; such reactions are typically undetectable by traditional mRNA purity analytical techniques. The identified modifications render the mRNA untranslatable, leading to loss of protein expression. Specifically, electrophilic impurities derived from the ionizable cationic lipid component are shown to be responsible. Mechanisms implicated in the formation of reactive species include oxidation and subsequent hydrolysis of the tertiary amine. It thus remains critical to ensure robust analytical methods and stringent manufacturing control to ensure mRNA stability and high activity in LNP delivery systems. Lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNA vaccines has become of particular importance, however, mRNA stability is a major concern. Here, the authors report on a study of lipid impurity mRNA interactions using reverse phase ion pair HPLC to identify reactions which render the mRNA untranslatable, reducing vaccine efficiency.",

            "text": "Drug and vaccine development in which the active drug substance is encapsulated with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) has gained momentum over the past decade as an efficient drug delivery system [1,2]. Several lipid-based delivery systems have been clinically approved to deliver small drug molecules such as doxorubicin and vincristine [3]. In 2018, the first LNP-based drug containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) named Patisiran was approved for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [4]. Additional LNPs are being evaluated clinically for delivery of a wide variety of nucleic acids, including siRNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), and plasmid DNA, for both therapeutic and vaccine purposes [5][6][7]. LNPs that encapsulate nucleic acid macromolecules are generally comprised of four components: (1) an ionizable amino lipid (cationic lipid); (2) a zwitterionic phospholipid such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC); (3) a neutral lipid such as cholesterol; and (4) a polyethylene glycol-lipid (PEG-lipid) [8]. The ionizable cationic lipid plays a principal role, for example, in siRNA transfection, by mediating cytosolic delivery of the siRNA through facilitated endosomal escape after LNP endocytosis. Neutral lipids, such as DSPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol, are selected to modulate the fluidity and phase behavior of the LNP, whereas PEG-lipids are utilized to improve particle circulation half-life and systemic exposure [9].",

            "text": "In recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.",

            "text": "Apart from the ionizable lipids, other lipids molecules such as PEG-lipids, phospholipids and cholesterols improve stability, delivery efficacy, tolerability and biodistribution. 5][36] Phospholipids help in the stabilization of LNPs and also facilitate endosomal escape. 37,38 The presence of cholesterol also stabilizes LNPs by modulating the membrane integrity and rigidity. It also affects the delivery efficacy and biodistribution of nanoparticles. \n\nLNPs are typically produced through the microfluidic mixing method, involving the passage of RNA and lipids dissolved in an acidic organic solvent through microfluidic channels. 39 thin this environment, the negatively charged RNA interacts with ionizable lipids, which transition to a positively charged state in the low pH surroundings, facilitating the formation of small lipid droplets that coalesce into LNPs. Following production, the LNPs are typically stored under neutral or physiological conditions. \n\nMany studies have addressed the encapsulation of RNA-based drugs in LNPs, and researchers have narrowed down various lipids that are essential to formulate RNA, 40 but the exact mechanism of how these RNAs are encapsulated in the LNPs system still needs to be understood. Several LNPs developed in the last few years are either in the preclinical phase or could never reach human trials. Thus, understanding the composition and stability of various LNPs is necessary to deliver siRNA vaccines while simultaneously looking for delivery safety. An earlier study utilized coarse-grained molecular dynamics to investigate the encapsulation of small DNAs within lipid nanoparticles. 41 Recently, Trollmanm and B\u00f6ckmann 42 elucidated the lipid arrangement influenced by the protonated and deprotonated states of ionizable lipids within a lipid bilayer. Their primary focus was on understanding lipid arrangements with different protonation states, both in the presence and absence of RNA, which they observed in bilayers. Their findings in full scale LNP indicated that mRNA-free LNPs with deprotonated ionizable lipids lacked water pockets.",

            "text": "An early discovery regarding mRNA vaccine development was a synthesis demonstration by Krieg and Melton et al. in 1984 using a virus-derived RNA synthase [21]. Furthermore, in 1989, Malone et al. reported on mRNA mixed with lipid droplets inserted into frog embryos, suggesting the possibility of externally adding mRNA as a drug [22]. However, it has been recognized that synthetic mRNA is generally unstable in serum and difficult to apply as a medicine or vaccine. This instability has been overcome with the dis-covery of delivery techniques using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, ionized lipids, and PEG lipids. Currently, LNP technology is indispensable in the development of mRNA therapeutics. LNPs formulate mRNA and protect it against nuclease digestion [23], and the mRNA formulated by LNPs is incorporated into the cells by the endocytosis mechanism. This technology was developed primarily by Cullis et al. Since the 1990s, they have been working on developing the technology to use LNPs to deliver short (antisense) oligonucleotides that control gene expression in cells [24]. Several oligonucleotides have been approved as LNP therapeutic agents for genetic diseases [25]. In 2012, Cullis et al. started experimenting with applying LNP technology to mRNA delivery. In 2012, Geall et al. successfully prepared the first LNPs encapsulating an mRNA vaccine [26]. LNPs developed in this way are used in current COVID-19 vaccines. The development of LNP technology has made it possible to stably administer mRNA into cells. However, LNPs taken into cells by endocytosis reside within the endosomes. Therefore, it is necessary to release the mRNA from within the endosome, but the endosomal escape efficiency is generally only about 2% at most [27]. Furthermore, although delivery to the liver and spleen has been achieved, delivery to other tissues is difficult, and it is necessary to develop LNPs with tissue specificity.",

Nanostructures can be formed by artificial design or by natural self-assembly mechanisms, which rely on intermolecular forces to automatically arrange into ordered structures. It provides detailed capabilities for modifying lipid types and ratios, essential for achieving optimal mRNA encapsulation and stability. \n\nNANOdesign allows for comprehensive adjustments to lipid composition, which directly impacts the efficiency of mRNA encapsulation (Li et al., 2023). Researchers can explore different lipid types, such as phospholipids, ionizable lipids, and cholesterol, to determine the optimal combination for creating stable and effective nanoparticles. By adjusting these components, they can influence the fluidity and permeability of the lipid bilayer, directly impacting the retention and protection of mRNA within the LNP. NANOdesign also controls particle size, which is crucial for effective cellular uptake. It simulates how different formulation parameters impact the size and uniformity of the nanoparticles, ensuring they fall within the ideal range for delivery. Additionally, NANOdesign allows for modifications to surface properties, such as charge and hydrophilicity, which can alter cell membrane permeability. These adjustments can enhance the vaccine's efficacy and improve its overall stability (Salatin et al., 2015). The tool models the release kinetics, encapsulation efficiency, and stability of mRNA within the LNPs, allowing researchers to optimize the release profile for controlled delivery. It also assesses the stability of LNPs under various conditions, including temperature and pH changes, to ensure the mRNA remains intact throughout storage and administration.",

Here, we consider a central aspect of accuracy, measurement traceability, which establishes trueness in quantity. In this study, LNP-mRNA is measured in situ using a novel liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach with traceable quantification. Previous works established that oligonucleotide quantification is possible through the accounting of an oligomer\u2019s fundamental nucleobases, with traceability established through common nucleobase calibrators. This sample preparation does not require mRNA extraction, detergents, or enzymes and can be achieved through direct acid hydrolysis of an LNP-mRNA product prior to an isotope dilution strategy. This results in an accurate quantitative analysis of mRNA, independent of time or place. Acid hydrolysis LC-MS is demonstrated to be amenable to measuring mRNA as both an active substance or a formulated mRNA drug product.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the formulation of mRNA vaccines due to their exceptional ability to encapsulate mRNA within a lipidbased structure, providing a robust barrier against ribonucleases and facilitating their delivery into the cytosol. LNPs generally comprise four components: an ionizable lipid that dictates particle charge, cholesterol, a helper lipid, and PEGylated lipids that aid in particle stability, formation, and membrane-membrane fusion in the cell. The lipid composition of LNPs allows them to merge seamlessly with cellular membranes. This integration enables the direct translocation of mRNA into the cytoplasm, bypassing the endosomal pathway and reducing the risk of degradation within lysosomal compartments. Once inside the cell, the encapsulated mRNA is released, allowing translation of the encoded antigens and subsequent induction of a targeted immune response [185]. \n\nFurthermore, the versatility of LNPs allows for their optimization in terms of size, charge, and surface properties. Particle size is directly linked to biodistribution. Particle sizes between 200 and 400 nm tend to accumulate in the spleen after intravenous administration, whereas smaller particles, ideally between 20 and 50 nm, are necessary for effective trafficking into lymph nodes [186,187]. By adjusting these parameters or incorporating specific targeting ligands, LNPs can be tailored to enhance cellular uptake and direct delivery to specific cell types or tissues [188,189]. This targeted delivery not only improves the efficacy of the vaccine but also minimizes potential off-target effects [190], making LNPs an indispensable tool for developing advanced mRNA vaccine formulations. These strategies collectively enhance mRNA vaccine stability, delivery efficiency, and therapeutic potential, which are critical for their application in preventing infectious diseases and treating conditions such as cancer.",

            "text": "One of the most developed methods for mRNA delivery is co-formulation into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 10 LNP formulations are typically composed of (1) an ionizable or cationic lipid or polymeric material (see Materials Used for Non-viral mRNA Delivery), bearing tertiary or quaternary amines to encapsulate the polyanionic mRNA; (2) a zwitterionic lipid (e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [DOPE]) that resembles the lipids in the cell membrane; (3) cholesterol to stabilize the lipid bilayer of the LNP; and (4) a polyethylene glycol (PEG)lipid to lend the nanoparticle a hydrating layer, improve colloidal stability, and reduce protein absorption. 19,20 though the mechanism of mRNA delivery by the LNPs is not fully understood, it is generally accepted that these multicomponent LNPs are taken up by endocytosis and can electrostatically attach and fuse with the cell membrane using inverted non-bilayer lipid phases. 21 Interestingly, LNPs can also be exocytosed, posing a challenge to cellular delivery. 22 Initial clathrindependent endocytosis, followed by macropinocytosis, has been identified as a common mechanism for LNP delivery inside cells. 22,23 nce inside the cell, LNPs are routed into early endosomes, followed by late endosomes, and finally the lysosomes where the mRNA contents are enzymatically degraded. 24 A hypothesis termed the proton sponge effect proposes that a few percentage (1%-2%) of LNPs evade degradation as the ATP-driven gradual acidification of the compartments from pH 6.5 to 5-6 promotes protonation of the residual amines of the LNPs and disrupts the endosomal membrane that leads to the endosomal escape of the mRNA content. 25",

In this study, a simulation system was constructed based on the lipid components and ratios of the mRNA-1273 vaccine [31], and long-term all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Using the converged MD trajectories, structural comparisons of mRNA-LNPs were made in two acidic environments (acetic acid and citric acid) and under different (N/P) ratios, employing analyses such as density distribution, radial distribution function, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Subsequently, possible mRNA encapsulation mechanisms were proposed based on binding free energy and cluster analysis. Notably, this study simulates lipid nanoparticles formed through mRNA encapsulation using the solvent injection method, serving as a reference for another experimental study. Overall, this work reveals the molecular recognition and encapsulation processes between mRNA and LNPs. \n\nIt not only provides guidance for optimizing LNP formulations but also contributes to the precise regulation of LNP stability and mRNA drug release properties, offering significant theoretical and practical value for the development of drug delivery systems.",

Currently widely used are LNPs with cationic or ionizable lipids [110,111], which usually contain cationic or ionizable lipids, cholesterol, co-lipids and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [112]. Ionizable lipids are the most important components responsible for nucleic acid encapsulation during preparation and lysosomal escape after cellular uptake. Ionizable lipids are positively charged under acidic pH conditions and interact electrostatically with negatively charged mRNA and increase the encapsulation efficiency, which in turn forms LNP-mRNA through interactions with other lipid components. LNP-mRNA is electrically neutral at physiological pH and is unable to interact with anions Review Discover Oncology (2025) 16:673 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-02542-y on the cellular membrane, which reduces cytotoxicity [113]. After the cell absorbs LNP-mRNA, the pH in the endosome drops, which causes ionizable lipids to get protonated. These lipids then interact with the endosomal membrane, disrupting it and allowing mRNA to escape into the cytoplasm to synthesis target proteins there [114,115]. As a class of amphiphilic lipids, PEG lipids are essential for controlling the stability, half-life, and clearance of LNPs. plays a vital part. The accurate delivery of LNP-mRNA has been made possible by research on PEG length, in vivo shedding kinetics, and adsorbed protein crowns. Phospholipids and cholesterol are essential for enhancing lipid bilayer stability, facilitating membrane fusion, and facilitating endosomal escape [113,116]. SLN are spherical nanoparticles with an inner core of solid lipids used to encapsulate the drug, and an outer bilayer composed of surfactants.",

            "text": "In order to solve the problem that the naked mRNA will be lysed by the lysosome, extensive research has been conducted to develop the protection system which is able to deliver mRNA successfully. Among these, LNP technology has been developed and proven to be efficient in stabilizing mRNA in the cells. \n\nLNP, a lipid nanoparticle, is a lipid vesicle with a homogeneous lipid core. Small molecule and nucleic acid medication delivery are its principal uses. LNP is made up five different kinds of components, and nucleic acid is the main active component among them. The remaining four structural distribution ratios are ionizable cationic lipid (about 50%), cholesterol (about 38.5%), neutral lipid (about 10%), and PEG-lipid (about 1.5%) [12]. The precise structure is displayed in Figure 2. The cholesterol mainly stabilizes the nanoparticle structure and carries out endocytosis mediated by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) structure receptors, and promotes mRNA intracellular uptake and cytosolic entry [13]. PGE-lipid can improve the overall stability and also be used to control the particle size of nanoparticles and prolong the metabolism time of nanoparticles in blood [14]. And the primary component of LNP is the ionizable cationic lipid. The negative charge, hydrophilicity, difficulty passing through the cell membrane, and fragility of bare nucleic acids make it easier for them to be obliterated by around nuclease in the body. So we need a positively charged lipophilic carrier for delivery. Therefore, the ionizable cationic lipid can be electrostatically adsorbed with nucleic acids, and can directly affect the delivery efficiency of mRNA.",

            "text": "The overwhelming impact of LNPs in mRNA vaccines (21) as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA) (22) and other RNA therapies (23) follows a continuous development of liposomal therapeutics over five decades. Initial lipoplexes (24,25) were designed as complexes of cationic lipids and nucleic acid, stabilizing and compacting the nucleic acid cargo into nanoparticles by electrostatic and hydrophobic forces (26). In LNPs (27)(28)(29)(30), combination of the cationic lipid with cholesterol, phospholipids, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid merges the advantages of lipoplexes and liposomes: robust encapsulation of RNA into nanoparticles by artificial cationic lipids on the one hand, complemented by the properties of natural lipid membrane forming components and protective PEG-lipid on the other hand, and optionally additional modifications for chemical or ligand targeting. Conceptual benefits of LNPs include their controlled self-assembly in well-established production processes based on low-molecular weight natural or artificial lipid components. The combinatorial space of four lipid components and nucleic acid provides potential for fast optimization. In contrast to standard liposomes or polyplexes, the LNP architecture is highly adaptable for efficient packaging of different nucleic acid cargos, ranging from small siRNA (22) to large CRISPR/Cas9 mRNA (23). \n\nThe LNP assembly according to common practice is already a dynamic two-phase process. The lipid mixture dissolved in ethanol is turbulently mixed with an aqueous acidic (pH 4) nucleic acid solution. By this, the lipids convert into small cationic micelles and vesicles based on protonation of the ionizable lipid, complexing the nucleic acid. Specific buffer conditions can modulate the assembly process (31). In the second maturation step, removal of ethanol by dialysis against physiological buffer (pH 7.4) deprotonates the ionizable lipid and stabilizes LNPs.",

However, the correlation between LNPs\u2019 physiochemical characteristics and their potency still remains unclear. The lack of regulatory guidance on the specifications for mRNA LNPs is also partially due to this underexplored relationship. In this study, we performed a three-month stability study of heat-stressed mRNA LNP samples. The mRNA LNP samples were analyzed for their mRNA degradation, LNP particle sizes, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In vitro cell potency was also evaluated and correlated with these above-mentioned physiochemical characterizations. The mRNA degradation\u2013cell potency correlation data showed two distinct regions, indicating a critical cut-off size limit for mRNA degradation. The same temperature dependence was also observed in the LNP size\u2013cell potency correlation.",

This study evaluates the impact of lipid mixture molar concentration and the addition of sucrose as a cryoprotectant on the size and stability of LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, we formulated LNPs with varying lipid concentrations and analyzed their size, size distribution, and encapsulation efficiency through dynamic light scattering and a RiboGreen assay. Results indicated that higher lipid concentrations not only improved encapsulation efficiency but also maintained LNPs within the ideal size range of 80-120 nm, crucial for optimal biodistribution and immune cell uptake. Furthermore, the addition of sucrose significantly stabilized the LNPs against size changes during freeze-thaw cycles, particularly at lower temperatures. This study underscores the importance of optimizing lipid and sucrose concentrations to enhance the stability and functionality of LNPs, providing insights that could enhance the efficacy and storage stability of mRNA vaccines.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe variation in molar concentrations of mixed lipids affects the particle size of LNP-mRNA.\nBuffer exchange using a membrane filter with centrifugation technique can reduce the size and uniformity of LNP particle distribution.\nThe addition of sucrose affects the particle size of LNP-mRNA.\nThe addition of 10 % sucrose as a cryoprotectant can maintain the particle size of LNP-mRNA at 4 and \u201320 \u00b0C.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

This is despite the fact that it is only semi-quantitative in nature, as it is a two-dimensional imaging technique [33]. While autofluorescence is often a problem with fluorescence imaging, luminescence imaging can, in principle, be expected to have an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio. Recent improvements in charge-coupled device cameras have made them more sensitive. Particularly in the development of gene and mRNA therapeutics, luminescence imaging has been widely used to evaluate the tissue distribution of exogenous protein expression and its change over time in the same individual, using luciferase as a reporter [34,35]. The protein expression characteristics of standard mRNA/LNPs have been reported after their administration through several routes [34,35]. Pardi et al. reported the mRNA translation patterns in mice of the LNPs (~80 nm in size) that consisted of ionizable cationic lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (50/10/38.5/1.5 M ratio) and luciferase mRNA (RNA/total lipid ratio of~0.05 wt/wt) [34].

This involves the silencing or replacement of mutant genes or the production of therapeutic proteins.

Nucleic acids are known to be rapidly degraded by nucleases and impermeable through the lipid layer of the cellular membrane. [2,3] o overcome these challenges, the nucleic acids can be chemically modified or complexes of polymers and genetic material (socalled polyplexes) can be utilized. [4,5] Formulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be another effective strategy for transporting nucleic acids. [6] Numerous U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LNP-based drugs have been on the market for almost 30 years, e.g., for the delivery of doxorubicin, but only one transports nucleic acids, in this case siRNA (Onpattro). [6,7] In the last few years, two new LNP-based vaccines, that encapsulate mRNA, i.e., Comirnaty and Spikevax, have been introduced to the market. [6,8] The LNPs in these vaccines consist primarily of four lipid components: An ionizable lipid, a neutral phospholipid, cholesterol, and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid. [6,8] Ionizable lipids not only enhance the biocompatibility in the neutral state, but also ease the endosomal escape upon protonation. In addition, they also interact with the mRNA and can efficiently encapsulate it. [9] hospholipids and cholesterol are primarily incorporated to provide structural stability to the LNPs, while the PEG-lipid plays a crucial role in controlling particle size, zeta potential, and reducing aggregation. Furthermore, the PEG-lipid extends the circu-lation time of the nanoparticles due to its stealth properties. [6]",

            "text": "In addition, icIEF can be employed to assess the surface charge of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines (Loughney et al., 2019(Loughney et al., , 2602(Loughney et al., -2609)). This technique is capable of differentiating the pI of LNPs that contain one or more types of ionizable lipids, aiding in the verification of LNP identity during manufacturing processes. As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations. Four different batches of LNP containing different cationic lipid to mRNA ratios were subjected to icIEF analysis (Figure 11). The results indicate that the cationic lipid is situated on the surface of the LNP, while the mRNA is located within. This is a reasonable assumption, given that the LNP fulfils the function of a hydrophobic protective barrier, thereby protecting the mRNA. \n\nTwo distinct icIEF approaches have been developed, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines, particularly those encapsulated in LNPs. These methods are effective for characterising the stability of mRNA-loaded LNPs under different conditions, such as varied storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, and are capable of detecting batch-to-batch variability. Overall, icIEF analysis has proven to be highly suitable for characterising mRNA vaccines. It has been an essential analytical tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to play a significant role in the development of future mRNA-based products (Krebs et al., 2022(Krebs et al., , 1971(Krebs et al., -1983)). The assessment of batch-to-batch consistency is of pivotal importance in the context of regulatory compliance. Consequently, other research groups developed robust and reproducible methodologies for the fulfilment of these tasks.",

            "text": "We confirmed the completeness of mRNA incorporation into the lipoplex using an electropherogram, which did not show the original mRNA band and any intermediate bands. \n\nPreviously, it was shown that to protect RNA from hydrolysis by RNases, there is no need to include nucleic acids inside lipid nanoparticles, as RNA sorption on LNPs' surfaces is sufficient [4,33]. We also confirmed the resistance of mRNA in the lipoplex to the action of endonuclease RNase A. The absence of the hydrolytic cleavage of mRNA by RNase in lipoplex samples of various compositions allowed us to confirm the completeness of mRNA incorporation into LNPs. \n\nIn these experiments, we used SYBR Green I (SG) as an indicator, the fluorescence intensity of which increases by 3 orders of magnitude upon intercalation into doublestranded DNA [36]. Although this dye predominantly binds double-stranded nucleic acids, the ability of SG to be included in regions of paired nucleotides, accompanied by a significant increase in fluorescence intensity when it is almost completely absent in solution, makes it possible to use SG as an indicator of RNA integrity. The complexation of mRNA with LNPs protects the nucleic acid from RNase cleavage, and the initial signal from SG does not changes upon incubation with an enzyme. At the same time, free mRNA loses sections of paired nucleotides during hydrolysis, which leads to a decrease in the signal from SG. In our experiments, after 40 min of mRNA incubation with RNase, the signal from SG reached background values, which indicated the complete hydrolysis of the nucleic acid, as confirmed by the electrophoresis data. Enzymatic methods with SYBR Green I have been used for DNA analysis [70]. However, most publications have referred to the detection of double-stranded DNA and the use of SG for PCR analysis (see, for example, [71]), and we have not found any papers on SG application for direct RNA measurements. \n\nThe use of SG allowed us to additionally evaluate the nativeness of the secondary structure of mRNA during the formation of complexes with LNPs of various compositions.",

Assuming an average molar mass of 330 Da per nucleotide in RNA, the molar ratio between DOTAP and RNA was calculated. mRNA synthesis followed the protocol provided by the HyperScribe All in One mRNA Synthesis Kit Plus 1 (APExBIO Technology LLC, Houston, Texas, USA), with T7 RNA polymerase based on the linearized plasmid pGEM-3zf(+)/RP1 1079-1518 .

The addition of 5mCTP and \u03c8UTP modifications significantly reduced the immunogenicity of the in vitro transcribed mRNA and improved its stability and translation efficiency. The purified mRNA was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further use. mRNA was encapsulated in LNPs through a self-assembly process. The pre-prepared aqueous mRNA solution and lipid nanoparticle solution dissolved in ethanol were transferred to a microfluidic device, where the aqueous phase and organic phase were merged at a 3:1 ratio.

LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA\u2010rich \u201cbleb\u201d structures. Here, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300 mm sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of the bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.",

            "text": "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability. The developed methods are very sensitive in showing even the smallest changes in the samples, as evident from the measurements of the samples after 1 week of storage in the refrigerator. In addition, empty and loaded LNPs can be clearly differentiated. Therefore, the presented methods offer several advancements compared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is",

            "text": "In vivo delivery of exogenous mRNAs is one of the major challenges in mRNA therapy. Therefore, substantial research has focused on developing more efficient delivery systems. Since a detailed discussion of each delivery platform is beyond the scope of this review, the interested reader is referred to other excellent reviews for more in-depth information on in vivo delivery of mRNA [90][91][92]. \n\nAmong the available delivery platforms for mRNA therapeutics, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are composed of a complex of synthetic or naturally occurring lipids or lipidlike molecules, are the most widely used. Generally, LNPs consist of ionisable lipids and stabilising molecules such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The exogenous mRNA is encapsulated within the lipid shell by electrostatic interactions between the ionisable lipid and the negatively charged mRNA [90]. LNP-encapsulation has been used for targeted delivery of mRNAs to specific cell types [93] as well as for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in vivo in mice [94]. Furthermore, a recent study where LNPs were used to deliver mRNA in utero into mouse foetuses highlights the immense prospect of this platform to aid mRNA therapy in correcting genetic defects before birth [95]. \n\nThe versatility of LNPs in mediating mRNA delivery is generally due to the ability to tailor the composition of the individual components within the complex. In this regard, modulating the type(s) of the ionisable lipids in the LNP plays a crucial role in the stability and successful intracellular delivery of the mRNA cargo. This has been most prominently demonstrated during the design of LNPs used for the delivery of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. For example, BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) utilises the cationic lipid ALC-0315 in its carrier LNP whereas mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) utilises a different ionisable lipid, SM-102 [96].",

Cationic lipids bind to negatively charged nucleic acids through their positive-charged hydrophilic heads, and the hydrophobic lipid tails encapsulate them. On the other hand, neutral lipids can be used to improve transfection efficiency and stability. The quantity of charged groups per molecule, geometric shape, and type of the lipid anchor are all important factors in transfection efficiency [62]. The LNP-encapsulated saRNAs induce higher antibody titers, pathogen neutralization (IC50), and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses than electroporated pDNA [62]. Recently, the combination of LNPs with dendritic cell (DC) targeting, UTR optimization, lipopolymer design, and ionizable lipids has advanced the field of saRNA vaccination. However, there are concerns about the toxicity of cationic LNPs, caused by membrane disruption, as well as endosomal escapes that interact with LNPs. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) that are also used for mRNA vaccine delivery are typically made from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. They have a wide range of physicochemical properties, which may be structurally modified for regulated release of the gene contents [62]. Cationic polymers encapsulate mRNA via electrostatic interactions to generate polymer-mRNA polyplexes. Polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) and polyethylenimine (PEI) are two commonly used polymers. PNPs preserve mRNAs and also facilitate their entrance into cells.",

Cationic or ionizable lipids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) or clinically approved DLin-MC3-DMA, primarily interact with negatively charged mRNA backbone to form electrostatic bonds, thus stabilizing the particles with enhancing encapsulation efficiency as well as the transduction efficacy [17,26,29,30].Sterols, mostly present as cholesterol, are in charge of securing the particle's formation as a building block supplement.The cholesterol also shows the potential of enabling cellular uptake via ApoE-binding and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [31,32].Helper lipids, resembling the cell membrane bilayers, maintain LNP stability by filling the particles with hydrophobic lipid tails [33,34].PEG-anchored lipids regulate particle size by controlling the fusion rate of vesicles during LNP formation while playing a substantial role in enhancing the in vivo bioavailability and biocompatibility, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacology [35][36][37].",

            "text": "Lipid-derived nanoparticles are widely used for in vivo delivery of mRNA vaccines [10,21,24,96]. They are composed of nano-sized particulates that are composed of synthetic lipid materials. LNP-based mRNA vaccines encapsulate RNA and protect it from RNAse-mediated degradation (Figure 2A) [21,97]. In addition, LNPs deliver mRNA molecules effectively through endocytosis mechanisms (Figure 2B). LNPs are generally composed of a functional lipid component that is crucial for the intracellular RNA delivery [98][99][100]. The cationic or ionizable lipid materials, such as 1,2-di-O-octadecyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA), N, N-Dimethyl-2,3bis[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienyloxy]propan-1-amine (DLinDMA) and N1, N3, N5tris(3-(didodecylamino)propyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (TT3), with one or multiple amino groups, can be positively charged at a certain pH, which helps encapsulate the negatively charged mRNA molecules via electrostatic interactions and associate with the cell membrane [26,101,102]. Further, the ionizable cationic lipids interact with the anionic endosome membrane, which leads to the formation of a disruptive non-bilayer structure, which leads to the release of the mRNA into the cytosol. It has been indicated that the hydrophilic head of the lipid material determines the acid dissolution constant (pKa) and influences the delivery efficiency of the LNPs [103]. Although the lipid materials enhance efficacy, they might have some side effects on the cells [104].",

Liposomes, meanwhile, generally exhibit low encapsulation efficiency of oligonucleotides [108] , making them impractical for development towards in vivo transport and delivery of nucleic acid vaccines.\n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), in their modern definition, are nanosized (i.e. < 1 \u03bcm) lipid systems made of two or more (generally four) lipids at varying ratios, and are differentiated from liposomes by lacking a hollow core: rather, they consist of a discontinuous mix of the different lipid components, and, depending on their formulation and cargo, may form a nanostructured core, a homogeneous core shell, multilamellar vesicular structures, or other selfassembled morphologies [109][110][111]. A scheme of classical LNP formulation components and morphology under cryogenic transmis-  Lipid nanoparticle formation utilizing a microfluidic platform with a staggered herringbone micromixer (SHM). Within the microfluidic channels, the SHM allows the aqueous phase (containing the nucleic acids, e.g. mRNA, under an acidic pH) and the water-miscible organic phase (containing the lipids and cholesterol) to proceed from laminar flow (pre-SHM) through several cycles of chaotic mixing until complete mixing of the phases has occurred (cycle 15). This process facilitates the complexation of cationic/ionizable lipids (dark pink) with the nucleic acids and the formation of micelles and early particle structures formed by the lipid mix, typically consisting of a cationic/ionizable lipid, a helper lipid (orange), cholesterol (brown), and a PEG-lipid (light pink), and eventually mRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles.\n\nsion electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is shown in Fig. 2 .

For novel excipients (e.g. cationic lipids), detailed information on the production process and quality control, including raw materials and intermediates, should be provided where possible. A detailed characterization of the LNPs should be performed, as well as a specific description of any formulation features that may affect the vaccine's quality, safety and efficacy, the impacts of which should be considered in the formulation development process [96]. The proportion of ionizable lipids in LNP lipid compositions affects the encapsulation rate of the mRNA vaccine and the nanoparticle selfassembly process; lipid species, the charge of the headgroup, and the hydrophobicity of the tail affect the particle size, morphology, and stability of the mRNA vaccine [97]. \n\nThe use of HPLC equipped with a CAD for qualitative and quantitative detection of lipid components in mRNA vaccines has been added to the second edition of the 'Analytical Procedures for mRNA Vaccine Quality -Draft Guidelines' issued by the USP [55]. Ionizable cationic lipids in mRNA vaccines have been shown to activate the innate immune response and act as vaccine adjuvants. Cholesterol may also activate the innate immune response and act as a vaccine adjuvant, so it is necessary to investigate and elucidate biological functions in mRNA vaccines and to establish quality standards with respect to these functions [98]. Some studies have reported that the presence of water in the inner core of the LNP affects the storage stability of mRNA vaccines, the amount of which is mainly related to the lipid composition and the internal structure after assembly with mRNA [91].",

            "text": "One of the primary advantages of POLYVIEW-3D is its ability to model lipid bilayer formation and nanoparticle morphology. The software allows researchers to simulate how lipids are organized within the nanoparticle, which is essential for determining the overall stability and functionality of LNPs. Lipid composition plays a crucial role in the efficiency of mRNA encapsulation, as well as the nanoparticle's ability to protect and deliver mRNA to target cells (Abumanhal-Masarweh et al., 2019). POLYVIEW-3D enables users to explore how variations in lipid composition-such as the inclusion of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol-affect the nanoparticle structure, influencing factors such as encapsulation efficiency, particle size, and surface charge. By adjusting these parameters, researchers can fine-tune the LNP design for optimal mRNA delivery (Watson et al., 2005;Arno et al., 2020). \n\nThe tool is especially valuable for examining LNP interactions with cell membranes. POLYVIEW-3D leverages the fluorescent marker Rhodamine 123 (Rho123) to visualize and analyze the activity of the P-glycoprotein membrane transporter in the MDCKII-MDR1 transgenic cell line (Sklena\u0155\u01d2va\u0301et al., 2021). This analysis is crucial for understanding how LNPs are taken up by cells, including immune cells like DCs, which play a pivotal role in the immune response to mRNA vaccines. By studying these interactions, POLYVIEW-3D aids in ensuring that mRNA-LNPs are efficiently delivered to the appropriate target cells, such as DCs, and interact with key receptors, including TLRs, to trigger the desired immune response (Porollo and Meller, 2007). \n\nPOLYVIEW-3D also facilitates the analysis of nanoparticle morphology and shape, which are key factors in the effectiveness of LNPs. Nanoparticle shape influences how LNPs interact with cell membranes during endocytosis and how they release their encapsulated mRNA into the cytoplasm (Mrazek et al., 2014).",

            "text": "LNPs are the most widely used nanovectors for mRNA delivery to date [1,81], shielding the access of RNases to mRNA. LNPs are usually composed of four components: cationic/ionizable lipids, helper lipids (e.g., phospholipids), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified lipids (a.k.a. PEGylated lipids), and cholesterol [1,44,81]. The suggested structures of mRNA-encapsulated four-component LNP are shown in Figure 4a [81]. The cationic/ionizable lipids are responsible for mRNA binding. Helper lipids such as phospholipids improve targeted cellular uptake. Poly(ethylene glycol)-modified lipids (i.e., PEGylated lipids) and cholesterol are responsible for mRNA-LNP stability [1,81]. In an earlier study, researchers coated mRNA onto a positively charged liposome (forming RNA-lipoplex) at a charge ratio [lipid (+): mRNA (\u2212)] of 1.3:2 [82]. This made mRNA fully resistant to mouse serum degradation, thereby effectively transfecting the spleen upon injecting RNA-lipoplex intravenously [82]. Current research has moved on to tuning the chemical structure of lipids to control the stability of LNPs for controlled mRNA release and reduced degradation. \n\nearlier study, researchers coated mRNA onto a positively charged liposome (forming RNA-lipoplex) at a charge ratio [lipid (+): mRNA (\u2212)] of 1.3:2 [82].

Despite the extended refrigeration period, the DMKD-PS LNPs demonstrated minimal size changes, unlike other particles that exhibited significant size alterations. Observing the size of mRNAcaptured LNPs at refrigeration temperature over 16 weeks, DMKD-PS shows consistent size, indicating structural stability. This outcome arises from the strong binding between mRNA and LNPs, which maintains their structural integrity over time. Notably, factors such as particle size and stability are influenced by the binding ratio of nucleic acids to lipid carriers [36], underscoring the importance of this interaction in determining the physical properties of the LNPs. These results demonstrate that DMKD-PS LNPs not only effectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their stable structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration. \n\neffectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their s structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration.",

            "text": "Finally, although naked mRNA can be directly injected for immunization, this method of delivery is rather inefficient. Indeed, mRNA molecules must be able to penetrate a cell's lipid membrane in order to reach the machinery required to translate the transcripts into proteins. Thus, delivery methods facilitating the cytosolic localization of mRNA vaccines are important for achieving efficient protein translation. In early studies, standard laboratory lipid encapsulation methods, such as lipofectamine [5], worked well for in vitro applications. These methods, however, had limited efficacy when tested in vivo and were also found to be highly cytotoxic [4]. The advent of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation was a turning point in the development of mRNA vaccines, as LNPs are able to efficiently deliver mRNA in vivo [30,31]. When injected intramuscularly, mRNA-LNPs can be internalized and quickly translated by antigen-presenting cells at both the injection site and in draining lymph nodes, thus promoting the initiation of adaptive immune responses [32]. Additionally, LNPs can protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases. Although the precise composition of the LNPs used by many vaccine developers is proprietary information, it is known that LNPs contain a combination of ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, phospholipid and PEGs that self-assemble into~100 nm nanoparticles encapsulating the mRNA [33][34][35]. Of the vaccine candidates in clinical trials, LNPs are the standard method being used to introduce mRNA vaccines to participants. Additional delivery methods that are not used by any SARS-CoV-2 preclinical or clinical candidates have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [4].",

All HL LNPs exhibited uniform particle sizes (54-76 nm), with PDIs below 0.2, indicating good colloidal stability. The encapsulation efficiency of HL LNPs was generally over 90%, except for HL-2, which had an encapsulation efficiency of around 60%. This result of HL-2 with a shorter tail suggests that tail length plays an important role in encapsulating mRNA. A comparison between HL-3 and its tail-controlled lipid TL-4 further revealed HCQ's role in mRNA encapsulation. TL-4 failed to encapsulate mRNA efficiently, with efficiency below 5%, likely due to its low cpKa of 6.4, which is too low to be protonated and capture mRNA efficiently.",

            "text": "LNPs were formulated by mixing an aqueous solution containing the mRNA constructs (EGFP or Luc) with an ethanolic phase containing the lipids using the NanoAssemblr \u00ae microfluidic platform from Precision NanoSystems Inc.(Vancouver, BC, Canada) [6]. The theoretical composition of the LNPs is estimated based on the precise mass of individual components (ALC-0315, DSPC, or DOPE; cholesterol or DX; ALC-0159) added to the ethanolic phase. Since LNPs were then produced using the nanoprecipitation method, all initial components were expected to remain encapsulated, and the molar ratios were assumed to match those of the lipid mixture. \n\nAs a first approach, LNPs composed of ALC-0315, DSPC, cholesterol, and ALC-0159 were synthesized using the NanoAssemblr \u00ae Spark\u2122 (Vancouver, BC, Canada) microfluidic system. In the lipid mixture, cholesterol was partially replaced with increasing DX concentrations, ranging from 25% to 75% (Figure 1). These two compounds, classified as steroids, have similar chemical structures and molecular weights, with DX at 392.5 and cholesterol at 386.7 KDa [16]. Due to its hydrophobic nature (logP of 7.02 and 1.87 for cholesterol and DX, respectively), DX is well-suited for LNP formulation, facilitating coassembly with other lipids through hydrophobic interactions [10]. The effect of this modification on the structural properties of the LNPs was studied in order to select the optimal conditions for mRNA encapsulation while maintaining DX The effect of this modification on the structural properties of the LNPs was studied in order to select the optimal conditions for mRNA encapsulation while maintaining DX incorporation into the lipid structure. The mean size of the LNPs showed a minimal increase after 50% and 75% DX replacement, from the initial 103 nm to 116 nm and 113 nm, respectively (p < 0.05). The PDI values remained below 0.1, indicating good homogeneity in the formulations.",

The 5 \u2032 cap and 3 \u2032 polyA tail allow for efficient translation, and the UTRs are designed to optimize protein expression [19]. A single mRNA molecule can be designed to code for multiple peptides [9]; alternatively, multiple mRNAs that each encode for a different protein can be mixed to create a multivalent vaccine formulation. The mRNA(s) is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to stabilize the mRNA, enable cellular uptake of the mRNA(s) for protein expression [19], and improve the in vivo stability of mRNA. \n\nAnalytics for measuring mRNA critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as identity, concentration, and integrity throughout the vaccine manufacturing process are emerging and evolving, but many existing tools are inherently singleplex and therefore not compatible with characterizing multivalent mRNA and may not be optimal for characterizing mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [20][21][22][23]. The absorbance-based quantification of nucleic acids can be performed quickly and easily using UV spectroscopy for naked mRNA or via the fluorescence-based RiboGreen assay for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [23]. However, absorbance-based methods can only measure total mRNA content and cannot provide information about integrity or distinguish the concentration of each unique mRNA in a multivalent mixture.",

            "text": "The approval of mRNA vaccines against the SARS-Cov2 virus introduced a new paradigm in vaccination and paved the way for new possible applications of this technology towards a multitude of other treatments. The mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines is based on the internalisation of mRNA, which contains the antigen coding sequence within cells to induce them to express the encoded protein and present it to the immune system. An mRNA sequence is typically composed of an open reading frame which encodes the target antigen and is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs), a five-prime (5 ) cap, and a terminal poly (A) tail [80]. Naked mRNA has been shown to degrade rapidly inside the body via a large variety of mechanisms. It is therefore necessary to increase the stability of mRNA-based vaccines as part of their formulation strategy. To this end, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been demonstrated to be very effective delivery vehicles and are currently the most widely used systems for the encapsulation and delivery of mRNA vaccines. LNPs are typically obtained by mixing different ratios of four components: an amino lipid; a phospholipid; cholesterol; and a PEG-ylated lipid [81]. The use of ionisable amino lipids reduces the interactions between blood stream cell membranes as compared to the cationic form. When LNPs are internalised in endosomes, the acidic environment leads to amino lipid protonation, facilitating the breaking of the endosome membrane and endosomal escape. The other lipid components within the LNP formulation are used to improve various attributes of the LNPs, such as their stability, delivery efficacy, tolerability, and biodistribution. Cholesterol has been shown to modulate the rigidity of the membrane, leading to an overall increase in the stability of the structure. Phospholipids have several different roles within the LNP, including improving encapsulation and cellular delivery. PEG-ylated lipids are used to modify zeta potential and particle size, prolonging the time that LNPs can circulate within blood and reducing their rate of clearance [82].",

They are crucial for encapsulating and stabilizing mRNA molecules, facilitating their effective delivery into target cells (Li et al., 2022a). The structural composition of LNPs, typically including lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Hald Albertsen et al., 2022), directly influences their efficiency and efficacy. Key structural features, including lipid headgroup interactions and the arrangement of hydrophobic tails, play a critical role in the ability of LNPs to fuse with cell membranes and effectively deliver mRNA payloads. Designing and optimizing LNPs for mRNA cancer vaccines demands advanced computational tools capable of modeling and visualizing these complex structures and interactions. Tools such as NANOdesign, POLYVIEW-3D, and PyMOL are indispensable in this process. Figure 4 depicts the various sections of the mRNA-LNP complex that must be designed, optimized, and characterized using these bioinformatics tools. This figure highlights how these tools contribute to achieving stable, functional, and highly efficient mRNA-LNP formulations, addressing aspects from pharmacology to pharmaceutical applications. By utilizing these resources, researchers can fine-tune parameters such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface properties to improve the performance and stability of LNPs in mRNA cancer vaccines.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising carriers for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery, with several FDA approved formulations on the market and many in clinical trials 1,2 . LNPs were designed to overcome challenges with delivery of naked nucleic acid payloads, including instability due to degradation by biological machinery and inability to cross membrane barriers. LNPs are synthesized via coassembly, often rapid solvent mixing, of five distinct components: ionizable (cationic) lipid, helper phospholipid, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid, sterol, and nucleic acid. The frontrunner for LNP synthetic methods, with respect to synthesis consistency and ability to scale-up manufacture, is high flow rate microfluidic mixing. This methodology involves the rapid combination of aqueous (containing nucleic acid cargo) and organic (containing lipid mixture) phases, which results in the formation of LNPs with low polydispersity and high encapsulation efficiency [3][4][5][6][7] . Aside from optimization of the synthetic approach, tailoring the lipid composition is arguably the most critical component of LNP formulation 8 . \n\nEach lipid component plays a role in LNP cargo encapsulation and delivery efficiency. Cationic or ionizable lipids (under acidic pH) promote electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged backbone of nucleic acids. This electrostatic interaction facilitates encapsulation of nucleic acid cargo within the electron dense LNP core. Permanently cationic lipids can cause unwanted toxicity and immune response issues, resulting in the increasing adoption of ionizable lipids 9 . Ionizable lipids are positively charged during LNP formation (pKa 6-6.5), while mostly neutral at physiological pH. Maintaining neutral pH during circulation helps prevent adsorption of negatively charged biological molecules, thereby preventing rapid clearance by immune cells and increasing circulation time. The ionizable lipid also facilitates nucleic acid cargo release due to electrostatic interactions with the anionic endosomal membrane, which occurs because of the protonated state of the ionizable lipid under www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

We have determined a discrete distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mRNA copies with an average of 5 copies per particle for our LNP formulation. However, potential users should keep two limitations in mind. First, this assay cannot distinguish between full length and degraded mRNA and thus confirm the integrity of the encapsulated nucleic acid. An LNP with 5 mRNA copies will have the same density as a particle with 10 half copies. This must be monitored by other assays such as (capillary) gel electrophoresis during drug substance/drug product characterization. Second, the data analysis assumes that the density and the ionic strength of the solvent inside the particle is the same as that of the bulk solvent. This may not be critical for dilute buffers like PBS but may become an issue in formulations containing high concentrations of excipients, especially salt as it may alter the vbar of the nucleic acid. A special attention should also be paid to the preparation of the D 2 O containing buffer (D 2 O is hygroscopic) as the low density of empty and full particles requires only a few percent of D 2 O to match the density.",

Furthermore, nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by endogenous nucleases in physiological fluids. To overcome these challenges, LNPs incorporating ionizable lipids have been developed as delivery vehicles for siRNA and mRNA, serving both to protect the delicate cargo from degradation in vivo and to enable delivery into the cell. LNPs for mRNA delivery generally comprise a zwitterionic phospholipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and an ionizable lipid. 45,46 Engineering the lipid structure 47 and particle surface has thus been pursued as a strategy to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape 48,49 while specific nanostructural features of the LNP, such as nonlamellar lipid phases, have also been suggested to affect delivery efficiency. 50 LNP interfacial interactions with the cell membrane initiate the internalization of the mRNA; then, inside the cell, the more acidic environment protonates the ionizable lipid, reversing the electrostatic interactions to release the RNA cargo for translation and subsequent protein expression. This is of course an oversimplified description, and the reader is directed to some excellent recent reviews that address these intracellular aspects in more detail. 45,51 The LNP morphology, lipid packing, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA are thus plausibly connected to the delivery efficiency, emphasizing the central significance of higher-order structure associated with both the mRNA and LNP. \n\nThe challenges of LNP preparative scale-up and large-scale processing represent another interesting point of distinction between mRNA-vaccines and biologic drugs. While LNPs may be prepared at bench-scale using pipets and simple manual mixing, 52 their cGMP scale-up for clinical/commercial use employs finely controllable rapid-mixing platforms involving multiple processing steps. 53,54 In contrast, the large-scale production of many biologic drugs can be based on relatively simple thaw\u2212filter\u2212fill drug product production processes.",

The final chromatographic conditions consisted of a step gradient with two isocratic holds after various chromatographic conditions were explored during method development. \n\nPotential degradants such as myristic acid, lyso-PC 1 and 2, and stearic acid are more hydrophilic than their parent lipids and eluted in the first isocratic hold. The four main lipid components are highly hydrophobic and eluted in the second isocratic hold. Two isocratic holds were chosen to minimize the effect of each analytes response factor based on mobile phase composition [20]. Impurities or degradants were monitored by loss of four main lipid peaks and percent impurity analysis for any addition of new, unspecified peaks. Percent impurity analysis was performed by integrating any peaks apart from the void, system, and parent lipid peaks. This analysis was monitored and compared in stability studies to the zero time point. As previously mentioned, based on the relative response of each analyte, the universal response of both parent lipids and their degradants are not achievable with this method. It would be worth exploring this method with the use of an inverse gradient or another means to a more universal response for impurity analysis utilizing a CAD. \n\nFigure 2A shows the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1, and DSPC. These lipid components are separated in order of increasing retention time 9.60, 10.15, 12.00, and 13.40 min. Figure 2B illustrates the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing the four lipids PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC in order of increasing retention time at 9.25, 10.15, 11.75, and 13.40 min. In both formulations, the four main lipids were baseline resolved for identification and content analysis. \n\nOf the four lipid analytes, three of them (PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, and DSPC) have an overall neutral charge and are not affected by mobile phase pH.",

            "text": "The emergence of mRNA vaccines since the 2019 coronavirus pandemic has led to significant advances in vaccinology by utilizing mRNA molecules to encode antigens, eliciting potent immune responses against pathogens. [1] However, mRNA molecules are inherently unstable and have limited immunogenicity, necessitating in-depth advancements in delivery systems for enhanced efficiency. [2] To address these challenges, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising solution to facilitate efficient mRNA delivery, and this area has been the focus of extensive research due to the potential of LNPs across various biomedical applications. [3] Rational de-delivery and expression efficiency as LNPs typically include four key components: ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugates. Each of these components is crucial for mRNA encapsulation, cellular uptake, and protection against degradation. [4] otably, ionizable lipids, forming the LNP core, typically consist of a head, linker, and tail. The head contains amino groups and other compounds that determine the charge and solubility, influencing interactions with membranes. The linker comprises esters, amides, and disulfide bonds, while the tail includes chains of 8 to 18 carbon atoms, which can vary in structure and biodegradability. [5] The pH sensitivity of ionizable lipids, influenced by the head group, leads to changes in charge in response to pH fluctuations, affecting release efficiency in the body. [6] Under neutral pH, ionizable lipids in mRNA/LNP complexes remain stable, but in acidic endosomal environments, they protonate, bind to endosomal lipids, destabilize membranes, and release mRNA. [7] The tail of the ionizable lipid also plays a critical role in the release of nucleic acids into the cytoplasm and the overall transfection efficiency. For instance, branching aliphatic chains in the tail can significantly enhance the nucleic acid transfection efficiency by facilitating the formation of crown-like structures, which contribute to rapid nucleic acid release.

            "text": "Introduction Lipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically successful vectors for hepatic delivery of nucleic acids. These systems are being developed for non-hepatic delivery of mRNA for the treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis or retinal degeneration as well as infectious diseases. Localized delivery to the lungs requires aerosolization. We hypothesized that structural lipids within LNPs would provide features of integrity which can be tuned for attributes required for efficient hepatic and non-hepatic gene delivery. Herein, we explored whether naturally occurring lipids that originate from the cell membrane of plants and microorganisms enhance mRNA-based gene transfection in vitro and in vivo and whether they assist in maintaining mRNA activity after nebulization. Methods We substituted DSPC, a structural lipid used in a conventional LNP formulation, to a series of naturally occurring membrane lipids. We measured the effect of these membrane lipids on size, encapsulation efficiency and their impact on transfection efficiency. We further characterized LNPs after nebulization and measured whether they retained their transfection efficiency. Results One plant-derived structural lipid, DGTS, led to a significant improvement in liver transfection of mRNA. DGTS LNPs had similar transfection ability when administered in the nasal cavity to conventional LNPs. In contrast, we found that DGTS LNPs had reduced transfection efficiency in cells pre-and post-nebulization while maintaining size and encapsulation similar to DSPC LNPs. Conclusions We found that structural lipids provide differential mRNA-based activities in vitro and in vivo which also depend on the mode of administration. Understanding influence of structural lipids on nanoparticle morphology and structure can lead to engineering potent materials for mRNA-based gene therapy applications.",

            "text": "Interest in the use of LNPs as a drug delivery platform for gene delivery has seen an exponential increase over the past decade, with the regulatory approval of three LNP-based nanomedicine products: one therapeutic, and two vaccines for use in clinical settings. Since oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs can consist of a range of constituents, screening of prototype formulations during early development is crucial. As the range of academic and industrial applications of LNPs has seen tremendous growth, established techniques within the nanomedicine field have translated into adopted routine techniques for characterising the physicochemical attributes of LNP formulation candidates. Trend analysis of LNP research highlights that novel high-resolution analytical pipelines have not experienced an equivalent growth in their implementation in line with advancements in lipid research and they remain under-utilised for studying prototype formulations (figure 1). \n\nThe goal of this study was to apply high-resolution analytical techniques for profiling LNP nanomedicine physicochemical properties during early prototype development to facilitate clinical translation for therapeutic applications. In this work we use DOTAP-LNPs as a model LNP system, using PolyA as a model payload. We report the evaluation of process parameter manufacture and purification steps on LNP physical parameters, and an assessment of their physicochemical stability under refrigerated and ultra-low temperature storage (\u221280 \u2022 C) conditions using increasing-resolution orthogonal techniques. These advanced techniques provide deeper insights into LNP CQAs, enabling better control over CQAs and thereby advancing their translation. \n\nAnalysis of process parameter samples demonstrated that post-dialysis exchange of manufacturing buffer to formulation storage buffer resulted in unmasking of surface charges, increasing the LNP particle size distribution through sub-population formation and decreasing PolyA recovery (table S2). Our results highlight the importance of filter membrane selection. Both the PES and PVDF membranes that were selected were hydrophilic and low-binding: thus, ideally suited to biological aqueous formulated samples. The PVDF membrane contains electronegative fluoride groups, whereas PES contains sulfone moieties.",

            "text": "In this study, we discuss the effects of different N/P ratios on the encapsulation of mRNA by lipid components and whether the type of acid used during the preparation of mRNA-LNPs plays a significant role. Additionally, we explore the mechanism of mRNA encapsulation and the structure of mRNA-LNPs. In the discussion section of this paper, we compare current research on mRNA vaccines with our study through Table 3.  [31]. \n\nIt was consistently found that the key to the mRNA encapsulation process lies in the redistribution of ionizable lipids in response to pH changes \n\nThe structure of mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has long been a subject of debate, particularly regarding the presence of internal solvent cavities. Our study demonstrates the formation of solvent cavities between the lipid layers and mRNA, encapsulating the mRNA. The choice of N/P ratio, which is a critical aspect in the formulation of mRNA vaccines, has been widely discussed. We found that an N/P ratio of 6 promotes better fusion between clusters when compared with a ratio of 3, although this conclusion remains controversial. The choice of acidic solvent for preparing the nucleic acid solution also affects the formation of lipid nanoparticles. Our findings align with those of Cheng et al., who have also observed that mRNA-LNPs formed with citric acid are larger [37]. However, we have discovered that LNPs formed with acetic acid are more compact. Regarding the mechanism of mRNA encapsulation, the prevailing view is that ionizable lipids play a crucial role. We propose that ionizable lipids encapsulate mRNA through electrostatic interactions driven by protonation, leading to a redistribution of components. \n\nWith the rapid development of mRNA delivery systems, exploring optimized N/P ratios and more appropriate acidic solvent choices will be key directions for the further improvement of the performance of mRNA-LNPs. Additionally, combining molecular dynamics simulations with experimental techniques could reveal more details about the internal microstructure of nanoparticles, paving the way for breakthrough advancements in mRNA vaccines.",

Particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were measured using a particle analyzer (Figure 2) (Table 1). All LNP formulations were hydrated in normal saline and their final pH was adjusted to a physiological pH of 7.4. \n\nWithout mRNA complexation, SM-102 LNPs displayed a nonhomogeneous particle size distribution. The ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs had an average size of approximately 200 nm, whereas the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs measured 150 nm or less (Figure 2a). Upon mRNA complexation, a shift towards a more homogeneous size distribution was observed in all LNP types, accompanied by slight size changes (Figure 2b). In summary, the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs exhibited reduced size and stabilized PDI values when mRNA was encapsulated. Although the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs increased in size, they remained below 200 nm. Notably, the DMKD LNPs showed a minor increase in PDI, and a decrease in zeta potential was observed for all LNPs after mRNA complexation (Table 1). The size distribution of the ALC-0315 and SM-102 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) was found to be more stable when mRNA was encapsulated. These LNPs typically use an ionizable lipid forming a monolayer, with mRNA and the lipid creating a reverse micelle core for particle stabilization [32][33][34]. The same pattern was observed in LNPs using DMKD and DMKD-PS. Unlike ALC-0315 and SM-102, DMKD-based LNPs, which use a cationic rather than an ionizable lipid, have a bilayer liposome structure. The inclusion of negatively charged nucleic acids either inside or on the particle surface stabilizes this structure.",

Mature mRNA is single-stranded, with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Start and stop codons define the open reading frame (ORF) of the relevant gene, which is surrounded by untranslated regions (UTRs) (Fig. 1). Any mRNA molecule can be synthesized through in vitro transcription using phage RNA polymerases in a cell-free system, 36 enabling mRNA generation from an encoding plasmid, unlocking immense possibilities for customized mRNA development (Fig. 2). 37 herapeutic mRNA primarily exhibits pharmacodynamic action in cytoplasm, 33,38 requiring successful cellular uptake, intracellular release (endosomal escape) and translation into protein (Fig. 2). Cytoplasmic bioavailability of mRNA is limited by two factors: rapid degradation by extracellular RNases; and the inability of large negatively charged mRNA molecules to passively diffuse through cell membranes. 38 Eukaryotic cells can actively uptake naked mRNA but often with low uptake rate and cytosolic transfer. 39 anoparticles can deliver therapeutic mRNA, enabling its internalization into cells through the endosomal system. Cationic nanoparticles are commonly employed because they encapsulate negatively charged mRNA. An ideal nanoparticle possesses appropriate charge density and molecular weight; low toxicity and immunogenicity; and desirable pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. dispersion, biodegradation and clearance capacity). 40 LNPs, characterized by an aqueous core and lipid bilayer shell, have emerged as efficient tools for mRNA encapsulation and delivery. 41 LNPs typically comprise four specific lipids: an ionizable or cationic lipid for RNA loading; helper or neutral lipids as the particle base; cholesterol for particle stabilization; and lipids attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve stability, prevent lipid aggregation and shield the particle charge. 42 he pharmacokinetics of mRNA-based treatments are largely determined by the mRNA and encoded protein half-lives.",

            "text": "Upon intramuscular injection, mRNA-LNPs (mRNA lipid nanoparticles) are first taken up by host cells, where the mRNA is subsequently released intracellularly. The mRNA sequence is then translated into the spike protein by ribosomes. Following translation and processing within the host cells, the spike protein appears on the cell surface in a membrane-bound form, providing an antigenic target for B cells. Some of the transiently produced spike proteins enter the antigen presentation pathway, where they are presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to T cells, facilitating T cell antigen recognition (see Figure 1E) [11]. \n\nAdditionally, vaccine production mainly involves three steps: preparation of lipid and nucleic acid solutions, mixing of lipid and nucleic acid solutions, and storage of mRNA-LNPs. Initially, four lipid components are dissolved in ethanol, based on their molar ratios, and nucleic acids are dissolved in an acidic buffer solution to prepare an mRNA aqueous solution. The lipid-ethanol solution and the nucleic acid aqueous solution are then rapidly mixed to form nanoparticles, typically with an N/P ratio of 3:1 or 6:1 during mixing. Finally, excess lipids and ethanol are removed through methods such as dialysis [12]. Currently, existing mRNA vaccines are preserved for extended periods through freezing, with cryoprotectants such as sucrose and trehalose commonly added to the mRNA-LNPs formulations (see Figure 1F) [13]. \n\nThe success of COVID-19 vaccines has garnered widespread attention to the study of mRNA-LNPs, with current research focusing primarily on three areas [8]: (i) mRNA sequence design and nucleotide modification, (ii) optimization of LNP formulations, and (iii) long-term storage. Nucleotide modification is considered one of the most significant breakthroughs in the field of mRNA therapeutics, as unmodified messenger RNA can be recognized by cellular RNA sensors, leading to the activation of the innate immune response [14,15], which significantly reduces mRNA translation in host cells [16,17].",

            "text": "Following their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising tools for delivering mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. Ionizable lipids are among the essential components of LNPs, as they play crucial roles in encapsulating mRNA and facilitating its release into the cytosol. In this study, 17 innovative ionizable lipids using vitamin B5 are designed as the core structure, aiming to reduce toxicity, to maintain vaccine efficiency, and to ensure synthetic feasibility. The top\u2010performing LNP in terms of mRNA vaccine delivery in the mouse model is LNP 5097, which is generated by incorporating ionizable lipid I97. mRNA\u2282LNP 5097 demonstrates favorable structural and physicochemical properties, high mRNA transfection efficiency, and long\u2010term stability. Moreover, mRNA\u2282LNP 5097 specifically delivers the mRNA to the spleen and lymph nodes in model mice, induces balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses, and elicits the production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies with low toxicity. The findings here suggest the high utility of LNP 5097, which includes novel vitamin B5\u2010derived ionizable lipids with reduced toxicity, in mRNA vaccine research for both infectious diseases and cancer.",

            "text": "As Table 3 listed, LNPs are formulated with ionizable lipids (e.g., 1,2dilinoleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane, also known as DLinDMA), PEGmodified lipids (PEG-lipids), neutral lipids, and cholesterol. The diameter of LNPs is about 80 nm, and their surface charge is usually neutral in the physiological environment [22]. As the key element of LNPs, ionizable lipids are used to stabilize nucleic acids during the preparation of nanoparticles [105]. They also mediate the fusion of LNPs with the membrane of endosome, enabling the release of nucleic acids into the cytoplasm. The PEG-lipids stabilize the nanoparticles [22] and hinder the plasma proteins from binding to the nanoparticles and prolong the blood circulation [106]. Neutral lipids and cholesterol are important for the structural integrity of nanoparticles and the escape from endosome and promote the membrane fusion of nanoparticles [107,108].\n\nHowever, mRNA vaccines delivered by LNPs must be maintained at an ultra-low temperature for shipping and long-term storage. To design a more stable LNP-based mRNA vaccine, Qin et al. encapsulated mRNA encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 into a liquid formulation of LNPs (called ARCoV) [96] (Fig. 1A), which can be stored at room temperature for at least 1 week and has more advantages than mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 in transportation and preservation. ARCoV is being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials (NCT04847102) since April 2021.\n\nSahin et al. developed a liposomal RNA (RNA-LPX) vaccine that encoded four non-mutated tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) of melanoma to target DCs in lymph nodes [110]. The RNA-LPX was prepared by complexing mRNA with cationic liposomes manufactured with the cationic synthetic lipid R-DOTMA and the phospholipid DOPE using the ethanol injection",

            "text": "In recent years, the delivery of antigenic mRNAs into the cytoplasm and their translation into antigenic proteins to acquire immunity has been well documented [1][2][3]. mRNA molecules exhibit low immunogenicity, allowing for repeated administration, and their single-stranded nucleic acid structure is beneficial for large-scale production [4][5][6]. Additionally, as mRNA metabolism is restricted to the cytoplasm, the risk of specific sequence integration into the genome is minimal, rendering them safer than DNA vaccines [7,8]. However, mRNA's inherent structural vulnerability, particularly its susceptibility to RNase degradation, can lead to inefficient delivery, consequently reducing its therapeutic effectiveness [9][10][11][12]. \n\nVarious carriers have been developed to address these structural challenges [13][14][15][16][17], among which lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successful [18,19]. LNPs are typically composed of ionizable lipids, PEGylated lipids, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH, are ionized under specific acidic conditions within the cell [20], facilitating endosomal escape and lysosomal avoidance [21][22][23][24]. PEGylated lipids, which are a combination of lipids and polyethylene glycol (PEG), enhance particle stability and prolong systemic circulation [25]. Similarly, cholesterol and phospholipids contribute to the structural integrity of the particles [26]. \n\nDespite these advancements, LNPs used for mRNA delivery require very inconvenient storage at \u221280 \u2022 C, reflecting a limitation in structural stability, especially when compared to the 4 \u2022 C storage requirement for DNA vaccines [27,28]. To overcome this shortcoming, mRNA was encapsulated in LNPs formulated with positively charged O,O \u2032 -dimyristyl-Nlysyl aspartate (DMKD) in this study. \n\nDMKD is a positively charged lipid at physiological pH.",

The encapsulation of mRNA by the LNPs was verified using a gel retardation assay (Figure 3a). In the absence of RNase A treatment, mRNA was detected in the LNPs. However, the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs displayed smeared bands, indicating suboptimal mRNA binding. In contrast, no mRNA was released from the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs. Upon RNase A treatment, mRNA was not detected in the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs, suggesting inadequate protection, whereas DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs showed robust mRNA binding. The primary aim of this gel retardation assay is to evaluate the strength of the binding between LNPs and mRNA, particularly their ability to retain mRNA without external release. In the assay, LNPs that are strongly bound to mRNA do not move through the agarose gel pores, remaining in the well. While LNPs with ALC-0315 and SM-102 partially retained mRNA in the well, most were unable to capture nucleic acids effectively and migrated through the gel. In contrast, DMKD-based LNPs exhibited a strong affinity for nucleic acids, mostly remaining in the well. When exposed to RNase A, only the DMKD-based LNPs retained nucleic acids, indicating superior protection of mRNA from RNase and a strong, lasting bond that prevents mRNA release into the external environment. \n\nFurthermore, the structural integrity of mRNA with DMKD-PS LNPs at 4C was assessed using a gel retardation assay (Figure 3b). Remarkably, the DMKD-PS LNPs maintained mRNA complexation even after 16 weeks.

            "text": "Formulation with lipids is one of the most common approaches to enhancing nucleic acid delivery. Mixing polyanionic nucleic acid drugs with lipids leads to the condensing of nucleic acids into nanoparticles that have a more favourable surface charge, and are sufficiently large (~100 nm in diameter) to trigger uptake by endocytosis. Lipoplexes are the result of direct electrostatic interaction between polyanionic nucleic acid and the cationic lipid, and are typically a heterogeneous population of relatively unstable complexes. Lipoplex formulations need to be prepared shortly before use, and have been successfully used for local delivery applications 228 . By contrast, liposomes comprise a lipid bilayer, with the nucleic acid drug residing in the encapsulated aqueous space. Liposomes are more complex (typically consisting of cationic or fusogenic lipids (to promote endosomal escape 231 ) and cholesterol PEGylated lipid) and exhibit more consistent physical properties with greater stability than lipoplexes 232 . For example, some lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), also known as stable nucleic acid lipid particles (Fig. 4f), are liposomes that contain ionizable lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-lipid conjugates 233,234 in defined ratios and have been successfully utilized in multiple instances. Landmark examples are the silencing of hepatitis B virus and APOB by siRNAs in preclinical animal studies 137,235 and, more recently, the approval of patisiran, an siRNA that is delivered as an LNP formulation 236 . Encapsulation of nucleic acid cargos provides a means of protection from nuclease digestion in the circulation and in the endosome. Additionally, ionizable LNPs also associate with APOE, which further facilitates liver uptake via LDLR-mediated endocytosis 237 . Similarly, LNPs containing lipidoid or lipid-like materials have demonstrated robust siRNA-mediated silencing in rodents 238,239 and non-human primates 240 .",

            "text": "The intracellular delivery of polynucleotides, which is crucial for gene therapy and messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics, requires sophisticated delivery systems.This is due to the inherent susceptibility to enzymatic degradation of polynucleotides and to their limited bioavailability, which primarily stems from their large size and net charge.mRNA-based therapies, while not requiring entry to the cell nucleus, necessitate targeted delivery to the appropriate cells and efficient release of mRNA in the cytosol, where it is made available for translation (1).While several different delivery methods exist, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as one of the most attractive and effective delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics, as underscored by their important role in the development of two Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nSince the pioneering work of Safinya et al. (2), a correlation has been established between lipid structure in the LNP and transfection efficiency.Experimental evidence indicates a significant uptake of LNPs through ApoE-LDLr receptor-mediated endocytosis (3,4), whereas the main bottleneck for LNP delivery is attributed to the endosomal escape (5,6).Nowadays, LNPs for mRNA delivery are designed and formulated with cationic ionizable lipids so that they form inverse hexagonal phases (7) upon endosomal acidification.This phase transition promotes the escape of mRNA from the endosome, thereby ensuring efficient translation and protein expression (7,8).Accordingly, the most prominent hypothesis ascribes the efficiency of mRNA-LNP delivery systems to the pH-dependent formation and stability of the inverse hexagonal phase in the LNP core (7).In this context, the study of Jayaraman et al. (9) on short interfering RNA (siRNA) LNPs has led to the common assumption that transfection efficiency may be maximized by an optimal apparent pK a value of the ionizable lipid component.However, data from the same study also highlight that LNPs based on ionizable lipids with similar apparent pK a values show orders of magnitude differences in biological efficacy.",

The condensation of nucleic acids in nonviral vectors has been accomplished using various cationic polymers or lipids [35]. pDNA, a double-stranded nucleic acid, and mRNA, a single-stranded nucleic acid, have different condensation behaviors depending on the carrier system. For example, pDNA condenses into rod-shaped structures when complexed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) polycations, while mRNA forms spheres [36][37][38]. In the case of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nanosized lipid aggregates complexed with nucleic acids in the core by means of electrostatic interaction, the optimal formulation composition differs between the delivery of pDNA and mRNA. For example, mRNA LNPs show efficient protein expression by using saturated helper lipids, whereas unsaturated helper lipids are preferred in pDNA LNPs [39]. Notably, nonviral vectors should provide nucleic acids with sufficient protection against nuclease degradation, while maintaining a high margin of safety in the biological milieu.",

In this report, supramolecular chemistry concepts are incorporated into the rational design of a new ionizable lipid, C3-K2-E14, for systemic administration. This lipid incorporates a cone-shaped structure intended to facilitate cell bilayer disruption, and three tertiary amines to improve RNA binding. Additionally, hydroxyl and amide motifs are incorporated to further enhance RNA binding and improve LNP stability. Optimization of messenger RNA (mRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation conditions and lipid ratios produce LNPs with favorable diameter (<150\u00a0nm), polydispersity index (<0.15), and RNA encapsulation efficiency (>90%), all of which are preserved after 2\u00a0months at 4 or 37\u00a0\u00b0C storage in ready-to-use liquid form. The lipid and formulated LNPs are well-tolerated in animals and show no deleterious material-induced effects. Furthermore, 1\u00a0week after intravenous LNP administration, fluorescent signal from tagged RNA payloads are not detected. To demonstrate the long-term treatment potential for chronic diseases, repeated dosing of C3-K2-E14 LNPs containing siRNA that silences the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) gene can modulate leukocyte populations in vivo, further highlighting utility.",

The consistent z-average diameters and zeta potential means obtained from repeat measurements of mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 summarized in Table 7 confirm that neither aggregation nor fusion are present and that the lipid nanoparticles are stable during the measurement period. Any change in zeta potential values across repeat measurements would suggest that changes in the composition of surface components may be occurring. Repeat measurements are important to perform to ensure that there are no stability issues present Figure 10 summarizes the zeta potential values (in mV) as a function of pH for mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 prepared in 10 mM NaCl. The zeta potential values of both mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 show similar values at both low and high pH values. However, they exhibit different isoelectric points (pI) with mRNA-LNP1 having a pI at pH 5.90, whilst mRNA-LNP2 has a pI at pH 5.21. This difference in the pI values is due to the different ionizable lipids which are present in both lipid nanoparticle samples. The pI values of the two mRNA-LNP samples do not correspond with the pKa values of the different ionizable lipids present in the nanoparticles but does correlate with the lipid to mRNA ratio and are consistent with other observations reported [25]. \n\nPerforming pH titrations is important in understanding how sensitive samples are to changes in pH conditions and how this could influence formulation stability.",

            "text": "Various challenges may arise with mRNA transport and delivery to target cells due to their innate physical and biochemical properties. To facilitate diffusion across plasma membranes, mRNAs must overcome their negative charge and hydrophilicity. An early study in 1989 showed successful transfection of mRNA using a cationic liposome structure [30]. Recent advances in development of an ionizable lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform show efficient mRNA encapsulation, high cellular transfectability, as well as minimal impacts on cell viability and adverse immune responses [31]. Due to their size and surface charge characteristics, cells internalize LNPs through endocytosis, and lipid ionizations under low-pH Viruses 2024, 16, 1404 3 of 14 conditions facilitate their escape from endosomes, thereby enabling release of the cargo into the cytoplasm [32]. Optimization of LNP size is crucial for mRNA encapsulation and improving half-life, with smaller LNPs being less likely to be taken up by phagocytes [33]. For pharmaceutical applications, particularly for parenteral administration, particles are recommended to be 100 nm or smaller for optimal uptake [34,35]. Furthermore, LNP surface charge is primarily determined by the ionic charge of the lipid head groups and is typically expressed through zeta potentials, with potentials less than \u221230 mV or greater than 30 mV ensuring interparticle repulsion and stable suspensions [36]. While such elements impact LNP stability to favor usage of these constructs as mRNA delivery vehicles, other factors such as surface composition and internal constituents further influence their cellular uptake, stability, and half-life. LNP interaction with extracellular proteins, such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), allows for redistribution of lipids between the LNP shell and core to alter its internal structure, ultimately enabling mRNA release [37]. Composition-wise, LNPs typically contain a helper lipid to enhance cell binding, cholesterol to cushion the lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize recognition by serum proteins and clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, with the proportions of these components significantly influencing LNP efficacy [32].",

When SG is included in nucleic acid regions with paired nucleotides, the fluorescence of the dye increases by more than a thousand times [36]. The intensity of fluorescence can be used to judge the integrity of the nucleic acid since when it is hydrolyzed, the fluorescence intensity decreases. Under our experimental conditions, a solution of lipid particles with SG without mRNA did not exhibit fluorescence. During the incubation time (1 h and 40 min), the fluorescence of the standard mRNA sample did not change; during the same time in the solution with the added RNase A, the fluorescence dropped to the background value, which indicated the complete hydrolysis of the nucleic acid. In samples with lipoplexes and RNase A, we did not observe a drop in fluorescence. This fact indicates the complete protection of RNA from the action of the enzyme under experimental conditions and, accordingly, the complete inclusion of RNA in particles (Figure 3b). \n\nDuring the formation of a lipoplex with most LNP compositions, the intensity of SG fluorescence did not change compared with the fluorescence of native mRNA (Figure 4). We only observed two exceptions, i.e., LNPs containing 1.7% of the GM3 ganglioside (sample S8) and LNPs with 44% of oleoylcholine from all cationic lipids (sample S13), for which we observed significant decreases in SG fluorescence intensity of 14% and 38%, respectively (Figure 4). At the same time, mRNA remained unavailable for hydrolysis by RNase. It can be assumed that the inclusion of gangliosides in the composition of LNPs and the use of a DOTAP/Ol-Ch mixture as cationic lipids led to a change in the secondary structure of mRNA after the formation of a lipoplex with a decrease in the number of paired nucleotides.",

            "text": "The accelerated advent of mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines, highlighted by the battle against SARS-CoV-2, underscores the urgency to refine lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for efficient mRNA delivery. In this work, we introduce a novel series of ionizable lipids characterized by double ethanolamine head groups, significantly amplifying mRNA binding affinity. A succinct three-component formulation is subsequently delineated, obviating the conventional dependency on phospholipids inherent in traditional four-component LNPs. Intriguingly, this formulation enables particle formation under neutral pH conditions, a notable departure from the acidic milieu traditionally required, attributable to the enhanced nonionic interactions predominating in mRNA encapsulation. The resultant particles exhibit exceptional stability, superior mRNA encapsulation efficiency, and maintain robust delivery efficacy. When deployed as a vaccine platform, the formulation elicited pronounced humoral and T-cell immune responses, concurrently exhibiting a favorable toxicity profile with a reduced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Our exploration suggests that by fine-tuning the non-electrostatic interactions between the ionizable lipid and mRNA, the dynamics of particle formation can be considerably divergent from the prevailing paradigms of mRNA-LNP formation, hinting at a broader horizon for lipid optimization within the realm of mRNA delivery systems.",

Hydrophilic oligonucleotides cannot be readily taken up across cellular membranes and are prone to degradation by endogenous nucleases, therefore the use of delivery vectors for both protection and delivery is required 3 . Delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) or polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are being explored in an attempt to bolster the intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides, however, these systems still have disadvantages concerning safety, stability and most importantly delivery efficacy 4 . Despite progress in the development and design of LNP and PNP vectors 5 , the delivery efficacy of short oligonucleotides using synthetic nanoparticles remains poor. It is estimated that only 1.5-3.5% of siRNA cargo taken up by cells reaches the cytoplasm, with approximately half of the nucleotide cargo released when an endosomal disruption event does occur 6,7 . Oligonucleotides such as mRNA are considerably larger (~600-10,000 kDa) than ASOs/siRNA (~4-14 kDa), likely diminishing delivery yields even further 5 . Endosomal escape is therefore one of the most substantial bottlenecks for successful oligonucleotide delivery. Improving endosomal release is a key driver for delivery system design and will be of great importance for the further development of oligonucleotide therapeutics, particularly for treatments that require high therapeutic protein levels. \n\nLNPs are of particular interest as delivery vectors due to their relative stability, low toxicity and ease of large-scale preparation 8 . However, optimising the chemical and physical features of these entities to improve functional delivery is a complex task. LNPs are typically comprised of four major lipid components: an ionisable lipid, a sterol, a phospholipid and a lipidated polyethylene glycol (PEG).",

            "text": "Due to its inherent instability, mRNA-encoding monoclonal antibodies require carrier assistance or delivery platforms to protect against nucleases and ensure effective delivery. Various strategies have been developed, including lipid-based, polymer-based, peptidebased, virus-like replicon particle, cationic nano-emulsion delivery, and direct injection into cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most versatile and potent delivery system [101]. These nanoparticles are composed of ionizable amino lipids, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids, and cholesterol and are negatively charged nucleic acid delivery platforms [114]. The ionizable amino lipids facilitate self-assembly, cellular uptake of mRNA, and escape from the endosome by interacting with the endosomal membrane. Polyethylene glycol prolongs circulation time by preventing the binding of mRNA and plasma proteins, which would otherwise lead to clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. \n\nPhospholipids support the structure of the lipid bilayer, while cholesterol stabilizes the lipid nanoparticle structure [115]. These lipid nanoparticles provide two key advantages as a delivery platform for mRNA. Firstly, they protect mRNA from degradation by endosomal enzymes. Secondly, they can take advantage of existing cellular pathways to enhance mRNA expression. The first mechanism involves utilizing the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) pathway, a highly efficient delivery system [116]. Subsequently, the lipid nanoparticles are taken up through TLR4-mediated endocytosis, forming a vesicle that fuses with endosomes. Following this, the LNPs escape from endosomes, releasing mRNA into the cytoplasm to initiate protein synthesis. \n\nLNPs are a popular delivery platform for mRNA due to their ability to protect mRNA from degradation and promote mRNA expression through endogenous cellular pathways. However, LNPs also have inherent immunogenicity that can lead to immune responses, which may not be desirable for in vivo expression of mAbs [117][118][119].",

            "text": "The authors obtained a good separation profile for liposomes and three main acceptor domains (albumin, HDL, and LDL) [58]. This study confirmed that rigid liposomes and PEGylated fluid liposomes showed higher stability in human plasma when compared to non-PEGylated fluid liposomes. This means that the bilayer composition of a liposomal formulation plays a significant role in stability and drug release in biological media. Hence, separation of the plasma-liposome sample by AF4 seems to be a potential alternative to already established methods. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are typically spherical nanoparticles with a solid lipid core that act as a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system [84,85]. LNPs were first approved as a drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the drug Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [86]. It became more widely known in late 2020 because some COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA-1273 [87] and BNT162b [88], used PEGylated-lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery [89]. Similar to liposomal drug formulations, determination of payload content relative to LNP size can be important to understand the efficacy and safety. AF4 has been successfully used for the separation and characterization of lipid-based drug delivery systems; however, electrostatically interacting LNP complexes with the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating are more prone to destabilization during the focusing step in the conventional AF4 channel [90]. \n\nNon-focusing AF4 channels (frit-inlet or dispersion channel) can circumvent the instability of the LNPs during conventional AF4 separation. In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39].",

We also report on 'real life' experience of the stability of marketed mRNA vaccines published in the public domain so far. A brief discussion of packaging is also included, mainly due to the lack of published data on this important aspect to date. \n\nSensitive and selective analytical techniques are required to monitor the integrity of mRNA and mRNA-LNP complexes. Therefore, a section of this review is devoted to a discussion of the state-of-theart analytical toolbox especially in the context of stability-indicating methods. Finally, there are two topics that are not covered in this review. \u221212 In contrast, the focus of this review is a topic that has not gained the same attention: the long-term and in-use stability issues with mRNA formulated as drug product. Second, only few references to small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation studies are provided due to their limited applicability to mRNA formulations. Compared to mRNA, siRNA is a short and uniformly structured, and it frequently contains replacements at the 2'-OH on ribose to provide a more chemically stable analog, e.g., 2'-F or 2'-OMe). As a result, marketed siRNA products can be stored as liquid formulations in a refrigerator, e.g., Onpattro \u00d2 . 13 e mRNA Molecule Chemical Components of the mRNA Structure Natural and IVT-transcribed mRNAs are delicate, high molecular weight (MW), macromolecules that are rich with specific information required for in vivo performance that can be easily lost by chemical degradation along the mRNA strand.

Previous reports had indicated that including unsaturated fatty acids as lipid tails leads to an increased delivery efficiency of LNP formulations. 35 This is potentially due to their lower transition temperatures and their ability to enhance membrane \ue104uidity. 36 Indeed, the overall zeta potential of OleSurf LNPs was increased and mRNA encapsulation efficiency was 90.5% with mRNA concentration of 43.25 ng mL \u22121 , which is comparable to that of the common lipid D-Lin-MC3- DMA (MC3). When formulated in LNPs, OleSurf resulted in 85 nm particles having low polydispersity with a slightly positive zeta potential (Table 1). The cryo-TEM image revealed the presence of bleb structures, and these \ue103ndings, in conjunction with the results from Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), indicated colloidal stability (Fig. 4). The physicochemical characteristics of LNPs, such as the particle diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and surface charge (zeta potential), play a signi\ue103cant role in determining their biological effectiveness. 38 Previous studies had highlighted the substantial impact of these physicochemical characteristics on the overall success of LNPs in gene delivery. 39 Since LNPs can undergo changes in their particle properties over time, during storage, potentially affecting their biological performance, we conducted measurements to track changes in particle size and zeta potential over a seven-day  Paper Nanoscale Advances period while keeping the samples refrigerated. Remarkably, no noticeable difference in size, PDI, charge or encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was observed during storage (Table S1 \u2020). In the context of LNP-based mRNA formulations, future efforts may be directed towards improving the stability of lipids to prevent mRNA leakage, particularly in the bloodstream following administration. 40 Gaining insights from current research that focuses on developing cationic lipids to precisely adjust their surface charge, it is bene\ue103cial to explore potential modi\ue103cations in other LNP constituents, including cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEG.",

Here, we evaluate a model RNA-LNP formulation with a selection of routine and high-resolution orthogonal analytical techniques across studies on the manufacturing process parameter impact and formulation stability evaluation under refrigerated and ultra-low temperatures. We analysed a model cationic RNA-complexed LNP formulation via the process impact on formulation critical quality attributes, short-term refrigerated stability evaluation and frozen-storage stability using zetasizer dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. We also evaluated freeze-/thaw-induced stress on LNP formulation using high-resolution field-flow fractionation.

Thus, functional mRNA delivery is quantified as the percentage of tdTomato + cells, and the contribution of each LNP is quantified by sequencing as normalized delivery 25\u221227 (Figure S3a). \n\nWe performed three experiments, creating one library for each lipid charge.

Unlike siRNA, mRNA molecules are larger, single stranded and more susceptible to nuclease degradation. The payload versatility of our formulation approach was assessed by utilizing FLuc mRNA as the model payload. A similar stepwise increasing concentration of DOTMA to replace ionizable lipid in the LNP formulation was explored (Table 2). Physicochemical properties indicated an increase in charge with the increase in relative DOTMA concentration (Fig. 2a). 20% DOTMA containing LNPs showed the highest encapsulation efficiency with downward trend at higher concentrations, though all formulations exhibited around 70% mRNA encapsulation (Fig. 2a). The addition of DOTMA also translated to effective protein expression in vitro, with performance trend similar to that observed for siRNA DOTMA LNPs (Fig. 2b and c). Interestingly, mRNA-LNP formulations caused loss in viability in RAW 264.7 cells while still showing mRNA expression. We observed that with increasing concentration of permanently charged lipid from 0-30%, the cell viability declines but improves at higher DOTMA concentrations. We also noticed that the expression remains almost the same despite the loss in viability. This observation is specific to RAW 264.7 cells, Caco-2 cells dosed with the same mRNA-LNP formulation do not show any loss of viability. A recent publication observed that C12-200 containing LNPs with fLuc mRNA was amongst the highest expressing formulation and demonstrated higher inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells [26]. The observed inflammation was linked to endosomal damage, crucial for endosomal escape and, subsequently, for effective mRNA expression. In an inflamed state, macrophages often adopt an M1 phenotype, potentially leading to increased uptake of LNPs [27]. The decreased viability in RAW 264.7 cells could be attributed to phenotype-associated excessive phagocytosis, lipid accumulation and subsequent cationic lipid-dependent toxicity.",

            "text": "SOMA capsules, while bypassing degradation by digestive enzymes, were able to inject the LNP-mRNA formulation directly into the gastric lining in vivo in mice and pigs leading to a high transfection efficiency both locally and in the systemic circulation. These findings represent a unique paradigm for mRNA vaccine delivery in circumstances where intravenous or subcutaneous delivery modes may prove difficult [105]. \n\nLNPs can be further modulated by the inclusion of branched polymers called dendrimers which contain an inner core and several layers of branched structures, at the exterior of which different functional groups can be incorporated. Drug cargoes can be encapsulated within dendrimers either via covalent or non-covalent interactions [106]. Dendrimer-based lipid nanoparticles (DLNPs) are robust in terms of tissue-targeted delivery of mRNA and monitoring of therapy. By incorporating PEGylated fluorescent dyes along with the mRNA within the DNLP, mRNA expression may be enhanced and simultaneously tumours may be visualised upon imaging [107]. \n\nLipid-based vectors smaller than LNPs have also been employed for mRNA packaging and delivery. Nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs), which are analogous to high-density lipoprotein, are discoidal complexes consisting of a lipid bilayer with apolipoproteins. With a smaller yet adjustable diameter, NLPs are more compact compared to LNPs [108,109]. NLPs composed of cationic lipids may have the potential for enhanced in vivo delivery of large selfreplicating mRNAs. For example, cationic NLP encasing of mRNA enhanced protection from RNAse degradation and boosted mRNA expression in vivo in mice. By fine-tuning the composition of the cationic lipids and including additional components, such as glycerol monooleate, the translation efficiency of the mRNA could be further improved [110]. \n\nCompact packaging of mRNA may also be achieved by bundling mRNA molecules by hybridisation with oligonucleotide crosslinkers and then packaging within PEG-coated polyplex micelles (PMs). This was shown to improve mRNA stability and expression in vivo in mice [111].",

            "text": "Therapeutic approaches have expanded beyond small molecules to include nucleic acids, peptides, proteins and antibodies, and, over the last few years, biomolecules have gained considerable attention with a large number in clinical pipelines as vaccines or treatment of several different diseases [1]. However, these molecules are highly unstable in the physiological environment, since they undergo a rapid degradation process driven by proteases and ribonucleases. Moreover, their physical characteristics such as anionic charge and high molecular weight hamper the passive diffusion across the cell membranes as well as endosomal escape in the cytosol [2]. To mitigate these setbacks, drug delivery technologies were adapted to address the new challenges and nanocarriers have been studied to protect the payload from premature degradation and to enhance drug retention in the target site [2][3][4][5]. Among these, lipid-based nanocarriers are often the preferred choice for carrying sensible biomolecules since they naturally interact with cell membranes, and they have shown less risk of undesirable immunogenic effects [2,3,6]. Liposomes, self-assembled vesicles based on lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous core, are the earliest version of lipid-based nanocarriers and they are widely exploited for biomedical and biotechnological purposes. Several clinically significant liposomal drug products (i.e., DaunoXome \u00ae , Myocet \u00ae , Onivyde \u00ae and Vyxeos \u00ae ) have been approved and released for different pathologies in the last 25 years [7]. Next generations of lipid nanocarriers, namely lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, show more complex structures and enhanced physical stability [6]. In particular, RNA-loaded LNPs comprise stable complexes between synthetic cationic lipids and anionic nucleic acids, which are condensed in the core of the LNPs.",

            "text": "Synthetic nucleic acid is providing new forms of vaccination and new means of modulating protein expression. Most recently, it has been in vitro transcribed mRNA that has garnered widespread attention [1,2]. An mRNA drug substance is a marvel of recent breakthroughs in biotechnology. mRNA can be produced by cell free synthesis, made to contain novel nucleobases, and still be manufactured to contain important post transcriptional modifications. To be properly recognized by a human ribosome, mRNA must be endcapped on its 5'-end with a triphosphate bridged guanosine-based moiety and modified on its 3'-end to contain a poly adenosine tail. Moreover, Karik\u00f3 and Weismann have found it to be highly advantageous for mRNA pharmaceuticals to contain pseudouridine as it can increase the resulting molecule's biological stability and significantly increase levels of in vivo translation [3]. These and other structural features of an mRNA molecule are shown in Fig. 1. Another major breakthrough that has helped unlock the potential of these molecules has been the formulation of lipid components to effectively encapsulate and thereby provide a vehicle for their cellular endocytosis [4][5][6][7]. Cationic lipids are at the heart of this technology, and they serve as ion pairs and counter ions to the negatively charged backbones of the nucleic acid therapeutics. With these stabilizing intermolecular interactions, the nucleic acids adopt structures that can be further built upon with cholesterol and zwitterionic phosphatidyl choline lipids and ultimately some amphipathic hydrophilic counterparts to yield solid lipid nanoparticles and corresponding drug product. Various lipid molecules, both naturally occurring and man-made, are being explored to achieve more ideal structure-function and stability properties. As one might predict, the stoichiometries of each one of the drug product components in an LNP mRNA must be robustly optimized and carefully measured. A schematic representation of a four-component lipid nanoparticle is provided in Fig. 2.",

            "text": "The DOPE molecule is a truncated cone owing to the presence of a double bond in the cis configuration in each alkyl chain and of a small polar group, which allow for the formation of hexagonal layers. For this reason, during an endosomal release of RNA, the presence of DOPE within LNPs can accelerate the fusion of the two membranes, thus improving the efficiency of de-encapsulation of nucleic acids. The phospholipid content of modern LNPs is ~10 mol% (Hald et al., 2022). \n\nAnother important component of LNPs that is relevant to their clinical use is the PEGylated lipid, whose proportion in LNPs is ~1.5 mol%. PEGylated lipids are responsible for some key properties of LNPs (Hald et al., 2022;Evers et al., 2018): particle sizes and their distribution as well as resistance to aggregation. The PEGylated lipid also modulates the body's immune response, determines the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the nanoparticles, and affects the efficiency of nucleic-acid encapsulation. \n\nThe use of nonviral systems of delivery of nucleic acids by means of nanoparticles, especially LNPs, opens up unprecedented opportunities for their targeted delivery to desired organs. The classic four-component composition of LNPs (an ionizable cationic lipid, cholesterol, helper lipid, and PEGylated lipid) helps LNPs to get into most organs and tissues, with predominant localization to the liver. Several in vivo studies have shown that modifications of lipid composition help to \"redirect\" the nanoparticles to the lungs and spleen (Meyer et al., 2022;Dilliard et al., 2021;Gueguen et al., 2024).",

            "text": "mRNA-encapsulated lipid NPs can be applied for production of the therapeutic proteins and gene-editing complexes for correcting disease-induced mutations in the hepatocytes [148]. Synthetic NP vectors composing of the nucleic acids poly(\u03b2-amino esters) have been shown promising for delivery of nucleic acids against a variety of diseases [149]. For expanding this advantage for systemic mRNA delivery, hybrid lipid-polymer NPs have been developed to deliver mRNA into the lungs [150]. Co-formulation of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) with polyethylene glycol-lipid has led to the development of mRNA formulations with enhanced stability and potency and capable of mRNA delivery to the lungs in mice following intravenous injection [151] indicating the effectiveness of degradable lipid-polymer NPs for systemic mRNA administration. Molar ratios and components of lipid NPs which usually consist of the cholesterol, phospholipids, polyethylene glycol lipids, and cationic lipids, may be optimized for ensuring efficient delivery of the nucleic acids to the tissue and providing potent silencing of genes [152,153]. Increasing the molar components of lipid NPs with additional molecules for tuning NP internal charge can facilitate the delivery of therapeutics in an organ-specific fashion and affect the cellular fate of NPs [154]. Based on the ideality of nanomaterials for delivery of antigens, RNA vaccines could be packaged within the lipid NPs as vectors [155]. This type of vaccines are currently under Fig. 5.

[117]. development for fighting against the coronavirus pandemic. mRNA vaccines could be suitable substitutes to the traditional vaccine technology that may be due to their high potency and short cycles of production [156]. mRNA vaccine entrapped in the lipid NPs can generate vigorous immune responses and it is possible to improve the tolerability of the vaccine without influencing its potency [157,158].",

The type of nucleic acid that can be encapsulated in LNP includes but is not limited to mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), siRNA, and single guide RNA (sgRNA). 6 LNP is composed of different lipids, which makes it easier for quality control since lipids are easier to purify than other types of carriers, such as macromolecules or viruses. 7 Furthermore, it is easy to develop new LNP by changing the lipid structures or lipid compositions, which added the versatility of LNP. 8 Generally, LNP was composed of four types of lipids, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids (Figure 1). The ionizable lipid is the most important component that is responsible for nucleic acid encapsulation in preparation and lysosomal escape after cellular uptake. 9 The headgroup of ionizable lipids is positively charged at acidic conditions, which allows the electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acid and increases the encapsulation efficiency. 10",

On the other hand, the operational simplicity of the drug product is offset by the complexity of biologic drug substance production processes, which are based on microbial fermentation or mammalian cell culture. mRNA is produced synthetically at large scale using the in vitro transcriptase reaction. 55 \u221258 The literature indicates there are many processing and compositional factors that can influence the outcome of the nanoprecipitation reaction, and it is also apparent that the chemical nature of the component lipids can affect the LNP morphology, 48 even to the extent of producing distinctive faceted particle geometries. 50 The siRNA-LNP literature reflects a fairly concordant description of the LNP assembly supported by biophysical studies. Presumably, due to their small size (\u224820 nucleotides) and double stranded character, the siRNA molecules can be more readily accommodated within a structural arrangement directed predominantly by preferences of the lipids. The much larger mRNA molecules evidently require a different accommodation. A direct comparison of LNP formation using siRNA versus mRNA under the same LNP preparative scheme showed that mRNA formed LNPs with very large bleb features, whereas the siRNA-LNP counterpart were devoid of these. 56 When one recognizes that cryo-EM mass density in the blebs can be assigned to mRNA, it follows that the nature of the encapsulated RNA molecule itself can influence LNP morphology and the degree of lipid association. Clearly, the encapsulation of large mRNA molecules is more complex than common representations of the LNP as a sphere with RNA lipid-bound in the core. 59 On the basis of our recent study pinpointing the location of mRNA within the LNP, 1 we suggest that LNPs may be better represented as a continuum of states corresponding to varying degrees of mRNA-lipid association as shown in Figures 2 and  3.",

            "text": "For effective use, mRNA vaccines must target cells, tissues, and organs with sufficient bioavailability for effective translation. Additionally, mRNA vaccines must undergo endocytosis by appropriate cells for cellular entry. Even if mRNA were able to avoid toxigenic PRR interaction, naked mRNA degrades too rapidly for adequate bioavailability, resulting from its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack and hydrolysis through the presence of a 2 hydroxyl group, contributing to hydrogen bonding instability. Moreover, naked mRNA is attacked by the immune system and destroyed. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various delivery devices to protect mRNA during transit to the target cell cytosol. Among these are lipid nanoparticles (LNP); besides protecting mRNA directly from degradation and aiding in endosomal escape, they are scalable and quickly produced [36]. LNPs were developed initially to transport small interfering ribonucleic acids. Four components comprise an LNP: a phospholipid, an ionizable cationic lipid, a lipid-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG), and cholesterol [22]. The phospholipid maintains the bilayer structure of the nanoparticle, ionizable cationic lipids (ICL) allow the release of mRNA molecules from endosomes into the cytosol, and PEG and cholesterol are used as stabilizers. Each of these components can be fine-tuned for maximal antigen delivery and expression. The proper charge profile and shape of ICLs are paramount. For example, appropriate ICLs generally have a pKa between 6 and 7. LNPs are assembled at low pH, which protonates the ICL. This allows its inclusion in the LNP, where they bind to mRNA and helper phospholipids [37]. At physiologic pH, ICLs are deprotonated and thus contribute to LNP neutrality, which is needed to prevent toxicity. Once imported into acidic cellular endosomes, ICLs protonate, which enables them to bind with negative phosphate groups on endosomal membranes to disrupt the endosome and release the mRNA into the cytosol [38].",

            "text": "Third, regardless of the nature of the amine introduced (primary, secondary, or tertiary), these lipids were able to efficiently encapsulate mRNA. Thio-lipids may rely on more than electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ionizable headgroup and negatively charged mRNA phosphates to form LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency-\u03c0-\u03c0 and sigma hole interactions with mRNA may also be implicated in the encapsulation process (22)(23)(24)(25). The lipids that failed to quantitatively encapsulate mRNA had either steric or solubility constraints. However, not all these lipids could deliver mRNA into cytoplasm. Investigating the cpKa of the most potent lipids and experimental pKa of the LNP formulations revealed no clear correlation between lipid efficacy and ionizability. For example, lipid 20b contained only a secondary amine incorporated into the thiophene backbone structure yet was more potent than its modified counterpart. Moreover, the resulting LNPs had an unusual pH response profile, suggesting a partial positive charge across a broad pH range. We acknowledge that more work is needed to fully understand the structure-activity relationship of these lipids. \n\nOrgan-specific delivery via LNPs and nanomedicines can be achieved via either active targeting [i.e., targeting ligands (21,26,27)] or passive targeting (i.e., specific properties of the nanoparticle such as size or charge). Little is understood about the adjustments required to achieve passive targeting for specific organs; however, strong evidence suggests that the nature of the biomacromolecular corona formed on the nanoparticle surface may direct the delivery to specific organs (28)(29)(30)(31). For example, ionizable but not cationic LNPs can bind to apolipoprotein E and utilize low-density lipoprotein receptor to enter hepatic tissues (32). The LNP ionization seems to be a major determinant in the corona composition, although LNP reorganization upon exposure to serum proteins may also contribute to this phenomenon (31).",

            "text": "Plasmid DNA (pDNA) plays an essential role in cell and gene therapy and can be delivered via different methods, including electroporation for ex vivo therapy or lipid nanoparticles for in vivo delivery. 1,2 Topological forms such as the open-circular impurities or multimers need to be characterized as they may affect the transfection efficiency. 3 Their separation is typically performed by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and anion exchange chromatography (AEC). 4 Limitations in the AEC analysis of pDNA include adsorption issues more pronounced for the open-circular forms and limited resolution between the various topological forms. 5 Conversely, CGE suffers from poor reproducibility and challenges associated with the identification of unknown impurity peaks. \n\nMessenger RNAs (mRNAs) as pharmaceutical drugs have garnered significant interest since their successful use in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccines to keep the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under control and reduce the risks of lifethreatening events. 6 The accelerated approval of these vaccines by health authorities (HAs) have curbed the pandemic emergency. However, questions remain about the nature of LNP and mRNA impurities and their potential effects on efficacy and safety. Specifically, mRNA aggregates are not listed in the COVID-19 vaccine specifications and the justification of specifications is not readily available to the public. 7,8 Both the mRNA drug substance (DS) and LNP drug product (DP) may self-associate to form aggregates. The large sizes of mRNA and LNP and extreme differences in their respective physicochemical properties are major obstacles to their analytical characterization. \n\nThe determination of LNP size and polydispersity is conventionally performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). 7,8 However, limitations exist with DLS, including the inability to differentiate bimodal size populations. 9 LNP structure and morphology are commonly visualized by imaging or scattering techniques such as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 10 However, these techniques are not quantitative by nature, have limited throughput, or suffer from measurement challenges. 11",

            "text": "RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines represent a novel and expanding class of medicines that have been invaluable during the coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic. The global deployment of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was a prominent milestone for those modalities, building confidence in mRNA research and further substantiating investigations of other mRNA-based medicines, such as enzyme replacement and enhanced cell therapies (Damase et al., 2021). The success of these mRNA therapies depends on their encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), assisting in the transport of exogenous nucleic acids to tissues while simultaneously preventing degradation by endo-and exonucleases (Guevara et al., 2020;Hou et al., 2021). Lipid nanoparticles are noncovalent assemblies of multiple molecular components and are typically composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized lipids (Lee et al., 2013;Hassett et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2021).It has been established that xenobiotic components, such as PEG-functionalized and ionizable lipids stabilize LNP formulation throughout manufacturing and storage, assist in cell surface binding, cellular uptake, and facilitate mRNA endosomal escape (Chan et al., 2012;Shi et al., 2021;Kalyanram et al., 2022). However, studies that assess the in vivo fates of LNP-mRNA formulations have focused on the mRNA distribution, and only to a much lesser extent, the biodistribution and clearance of LNP components and their metabolites (Hou et al., 2021). A comprehensive analysis to evaluate the biodistribution and clearance of both the mRNA and LNP constituents is crucial to fully assess the safety and efficacy of these components in both preclinical and clinical settings and inform the continued development of improved mRNA-LNP based medicines.\n\nAs studies into LNP formulations continue, emerging evidence suggests that LNPs have the potential for organ-and tissue-specific tropism of mRNA-based medicines (Rostami et al., 2014;Veiga et al.",

Based on this observation, all the IVT mRNAs applied in following investigations were prepared via enzymatic capping approach. We further evaluated the properties of purified IVT mRNAs versus unpurified counterparts after encapsulation in LNP, including their particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI). The LNP encapsulating the purified mRNA (LNP-P) exhibited better uniformity and smaller sizes than those from counterpart with unpurified mRNA (LNP-U); both groups predominantly exhibited as negatively charged nanoparticles (Fig. 3F). Additionally, the purification process had minimal impact on the morphology of the nanoparticles (Fig. 3G), the encapsulation efficiency of LNP formulations and the IVT mRNA capping rates (Fig. 3H), implying the advantages of this purification approach in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of IVT mRNA within LNP.

            "text": "It is perhaps not surprising that LNP lipid compositions optimized for siRNA delivery to the liver are not optimal for delivery of mRNA. As noted, reasons for the enhanced transfection properties of LNP mRNA systems containing 40 mol % ESM could include the improved stability of the encapsulated mRNA as well as the enhanced transfection potency following uptake into cells as indicated by the in vitro results presented here. \n\nThere are many other factors that could also play a role in increasing transfection potency for the high-ESM LNP system. For example, the protein corona adsorbed by the LNPs in the presence of serum proteins can dramatically affect cell tropism. 35 In addition, it should be noted that a dose based on mg mRNA/kg body weight of the LNP mRNA systems containing high levels of helper lipids such as ESM results in more LNPs per dose with a lower number of copies of mRNA per LNP. For instance, for LNP mRNA systems prepared at an N/P value of 6 with a diameter of 50 nm it can be calculated that a dose of LNP with the ESM/MC3/Chol/PEG-lipid (40:33:25.5:1.5 mol/mol) lipid composition contains approximately 1.7 times as many LNPs compared with an equivalent dose of LNP with the Onpattro lipid composition. Furthermore, if it is assumed that all of the LNPs contain mRNA it can be calculated that the average number of mRNA per LNP decreases from $2.1 copies per LNP for the Onpattro composition to $1.3 for the LNP containing 40 mol % ESM. However, as noted by Li et al., cryo-TEM and other common nanoparticle characterization methods such as small-angle neutron scattering, NMR, and nanoparticle tracking analysis, could not effectively resolve these payload characteristics at the singlenanoparticle level, primarily due to difficulty in distinguishing empty LNPs from those with a payload, and in quantifying mRNA molecules in mRNA-loaded LNPs. 36",

            "text": "To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. The main benefit of IP-RP LC over other chromatographic modes (such as AEX, SEC, and SC) is that it can be easily coupled with MS, considerably broadening its field of application. IP-RP LC-MS is often used for measuring important structural features of mRNA molecules, such as 5 \u2032 capping efficiency and 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail length [43]. Structural characterizations for the capping efficiency and the poly(A) tail by LC-MS have been recently reviewed [41,43].",

Fig. 6 indicates that DOG-IM4 LNPs retained most of their in vivo bioactivity (<20% loss) after 25 weeks of storage at 4 \u2022 C, while in the same conditions, L319 and MC3 LNPs lost more than 80% of their bioactivity (Fig. 6, Panel E). At 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C, hEPO expression from the DOG-IM4 LNPs declined rapidly over 3 weeks but appeared to remain stable for at least one week at 25 \u2022 C (Fig. 6, Panel A). The limitation of these observations being the inherent variability of a bioactivity assay performed in different mice at different points in time, we tried to correlate these observations with an evolution of the physicochemical characteristics of the LNPs. The loss of bioactivity upon storage at 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C was found to correlate with an accelerated mRNA degradation at these temperatures as assessed by performing fragment analysis on the mRNA after extraction from the LNPs (Fig. 6, Panel B). An apparent increase in DOG-IM4 LNP average particle size from 130 to 150 nm, which correlated with mRNA degradation when the LNPs were stored at 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C was also observed (Fig. 6, Panel C). There was no apparent change in mRNA encapsulation (Fig. 6, Panel D) and LNP lipid integrity (Fig. 7) during this accelerated stability study. Note that mRNA integrity analysis could not be performed on L319 and MC3 LNPs due to poor mRNA extraction yields from these LNPs. The other physicochemical parameters of the L319 and MC3 LNPs (particle sizes, mRNA encapsulation and lipid integrity), however, remained stable over the 25-week storage period at 4 \u2022 C (data not shown).\n\nBased on the outstanding stability of DOG-IM4 LNPs and the high and homogeneous HI titers obtained with DOG-IM4 and",

This type of core structure has been previously found in both unloaded and siRNA (small interfering RNA) containing LNPs, as demonstrated by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) (Kulkarni et al., 2019. Similarly, studies of mRNA-LNPs have shown electron dense cores ( Fig. 2) (Arteta et al., 2018;Eygeris et al., 2020;Leung et al., 2015;Patel et al., 2020;Tanaka et al., 2020). Thionine was used for cryo-TEM contrast enhancement (Brader et al., 2021).\n\nAlthough their lipid core is a common feature of mRNA-LNPs, characteristics of the exact structure of this core and its dependence on lipid ingredients (molar ratios) and the localization of the mRNA are still under debate (see Fig. 3). mRNA is certainly located inside the LNPs, as determined by the RiboGreen assay. RiboGreen is a dye that exhibits fluorescence when bound to single stranded mRNA, but cannot enter the LNPs. In mRNA-LNP formulations, such as those used in mRNA vaccines, the fraction of accessible mRNA is very low (Arteta et al., 2018;Patel et al., 2020) and thus, encapsulation efficiencies, derived from Ribo-Green assays, are typically > 90%. Taken together, the cryo-TEM (Fig. 2) and encapsulation evidence shows that the mRNA-LNPs form nanoparticles with encapsulated mRNA that is protected from the external medium. There are 3 models proposed for the structure of mRNA encapsulated by LNPs; these mainly originate from siRNA-LNPs analysis (Fig. 3).\n\nThe dawn of mRNA vaccA limitation of this is that the encapsulated cargo affects the structure of LNPs: siRNA is very different from mRNA in structure and size (Table 2) and the molar N/P (ionizable cationic lipid over phosphate) molar ratios differ, 3 versus 6, respectively (Table 1). mRNA is at least 100-fold larger than siRNA and this affects the structure of",

            "text": ", in 2005, Drs. Kariko and Weissman found an effective way to evade the innate immune response by modifying the mRNA's nucleosides [4]. This major breakthrough completely altered the pharmaceutical potential of mRNA therapies and resulted in substantial investment in associated research, leading to important discoveries in mRNA modification and purification to reduce the innate immune response and improve mRNA stability.\n\nThe challenge for effective application of mRNA vaccines lies in the delivery at both the micro and macro levels. Naked mRNA is rapidly degraded by extracellular RNases, it can be immunogenic, and alone, it cannot penetrate cell membranes to be transcribed in the cytosol. Thus, intracellular delivery is essential to facilitate cellular uptake of mRNA and to protect it from RNase degradation. To date, numerous delivery methods have been developed, including ex vivo loading of dendritic cells, physical delivery methods, cationic peptide protamine, and cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivery, among which LNPs seems to be the most appealing and commonly used tool [2]. LNPs often consists of four components: (1) cationic or ionizable lipids, smart macromolecules that can be functionalized to improve the entrapment of mRNA, to increase cellular uptake efficiency, and promote endosomal escape; (2) lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is used for reducing particle sizes, preventing particle aggregation, increasing circulation time and reducing uptake by untargeted cells; (3) cholesterol that stabilizes LNPs complexes; and (4) phospholipids, which support lipid bilayer structure [2]. Although each of the LNPs' components has been under intensive study for LNPs delivery optimization using different formulation expertise, challenges, such as inefficient transfection and nonspecific targeting, remain for bringing the full potential of mRNA vaccines into play. Continuing research into diverse delivery platforms is still a priority to guide the development and optimization of intraellular delivery systems.\n\nThe authorization of mRNA vaccines for use is only the first of many steps to achieving effective application and success in battling the current pandemic.

By visualizing the changes in nanoparticle morphology and surface charge as lipid composition is modified, researchers can determine the best formulation for maximizing mRNA encapsulation, delivery efficiency, and stability under physiological conditions. PyMOL helps fine-tune these compositions, optimizing the LNP's ability to deliver mRNA effectively while maintaining stability during storage and transport (El Khoury et al., 2023). In addition to lipid composition, the surface properties of LNPs, including charge, hydrophobicity, and hydrophilicity, play a crucial role in their interaction with cellular membranes. PyMOL allows researchers to model how altering these properties impacts the nanoparticle's ability to be taken up by cells. PyMOL helps in understanding how LNPs interact with cellular membranes during the process of endocytosis. By simulating the insertion of LNPs into the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane, PyMOL enables researchers to visualize how LNPs may fuse with the membrane and release mRNA into the cytoplasm. This insight is vital for designing LNPs that optimize cellular uptake and ensure the efficient delivery of mRNA into cells for translation (Yong, 2015). PyMOL allows researchers to visualize the impact of particle size and morphology on the functionality of LNPs. Particle size is critical for effective cellular uptake, and by using PyMOL, researchers can simulate how varying nanoparticle sizes and shapes affect the overall performance of mRNA delivery. The tool helps visualize how the size and shape of the LNPs influence their stability, encapsulation efficiency, and release kinetics, which are essential factors for improving vaccine efficacy (Cao et al., 2020;Sebastiani et al., 2021). \n\nPyMOL can also be used to simulate the effects of various environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength on the stability and function of LNPs.",

The tissue-specific distribution could potentially be facilitated by multiple factors, including LNP particle size, lipid components, and incorporation of specific targeting proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies on the LNP surface (Veiga et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2021;Di et al., 2022). Although these properties of LNPs are enticing for future drug development, reports have identified variability in delivery of these constructs with greater inflammatory responses associated with the use of xenobiotic lipids which is not apparent with naturallyoccurring LNP components (Ndeupen et al., 2021). As naturally occurring LNP components (e.g., lipids, cholesterol, cholesterol esters) undergo in vivo processing similar to that of endogenous analogs and xenobiotic lipid clearance routes are typically unknown (Scioli Montoto et al., 2020), a thorough assessment of safety and reactogenicity after LNP administration is needed. It is thus crucial that studies focus on both the primary biodistribution of the intact mRNA-LNP as well as the redistribution of its constituents and metabolites to evaluate the immunogenic potential of the intact mRNA-LNP formulation, its constituents, and their metabolites.\n\nStudies investigating mRNA-LNP biodistribution have traditionally used methods such as intracellular enzymatic reporters to track the delivery of intact encapsulated mRNA into host cells (Hassett et al., 2019;Aldosari et al., 2021;Delehedde et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2021). Such methods provide information on the biodistribution of intact mRNA-LNPs, but because the reporting capacity of these techniques is dependent solely on the viability and successful delivery of the intact mRNA, this method has limited use in determining the in vivo fates of constituents, metabolites, or of damaged mRNA-",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are enabling the rapid advancement of nucleic acid therapeutics to the clinic, including promising new modalities like CRISPR ( 1 ,2 ) to treat and possibly cure previously intractable diseases. LNPs typically consist of four components including polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids, ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol and phospholipids in specific molar ratios. The design space for optimizing the four components of LNPs as well as the formulation parameters is very large, potentially to a scale of 10 10 unique LNP formulations ( 3 ). This establishes the need to screen LNPs in a high throughput way. \n\nTypically, a high throughput screen will be done in vitro using a suitable model and lead candidates selected for in vivo studies. While these in vitro screens help to identify promising leads, evidence of poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo results ( 4 ,5 ) make the case for high throughput in vivo screens where the particles can be assessed in a relevant physiological and pathological context. To make in vivo screening of LNPs more efficient, the high-throughput approach should achieve the same outcome as an individual group screenwhich is lead identification and optimization based on functional delivery of the LNP cargo. Novel methods to screen for LNPs in vivo have been developed including the use of DNA barcodes (bDNA) to identify LNPs that target endothelial cells and other tissues ( 6 ,7 ). This approach allows for the screening of > 100 LNPs in a single pool but requires coformulation of the functional nucleic acid (siRNA or mRNA) with a small DNA barcode. The formulation of different types of nucleic acids has however been shown to change the structure of the LNP and potentially alter the LNP delivery, potentially changing the outcome of the screen ( 8 ,9 ). Another approach utilizes barcodes encoded for in the 3 untranslated (UTR) region of the functional mRNA, thus formulating only one type of nucleic acid -an improvement over the bDNA approach ( 9 ).",

The mRNA-LNPs were approximately 100 nm in diameter and had a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.2-0.25 (Figure 2C), measured using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. TPO mRNA-LNP mediated a highly efficient transfection of HEK293T cells, which resulted in abundant TPO secretion (Figure 2D). To examine the duration and biodistribution of protein production by mRNA-LNPs in vivo, 0.5 mg/kg luciferase mRNA-LNPs were administered into mice by intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) injections. The i.v. administration resulted in mRNA-LNPs being delivered to the liver, while the i.m. route targeted both the liver and the injection site (Figure 2E). In the liver, luciferase mRNA was translated, and a strong bioluminescence signal was recorded in the first 24 h after injection. Translation rate decreased quickly in the liver, showing an approximately 10-fold decrease per day. Quantification of luminescence values indi-cated that i.v. delivery is far more efficient than i.m. delivery. However, protein expression in the muscle decayed slowly and tended to last longer (Figures 2E and 2F).",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are proposed to enhance mRNA delivery efficiency; however, their design is suboptimal. Here, a rational method for designing LNPs is explored, focusing on the ionizable lipid composition and structural optimization using machine learning (ML) techniques. A total of 213 LNPs are analyzed using random forest regression models trained with 314 features to predict the mRNA expression efficiency. The models, which predict mRNA expression levels post\u2010administration of intradermal injection in mice, identify phenol as the dominant substructure affecting mRNA encapsulation and expression. The specific phospholipids used as components of the LNPs, as well as the N/P ratio and mass ratio, are found to affect the efficacy of mRNA delivery. Structural analysis highlights the impact of the carbon chain length on the encapsulation efficiency and LNP stability. This integrated approach offers a framework for designing advanced LNPs and has the potential to unlock the full potential of mRNA therapeutics.",

            "text": "The ability to deliver mRNA to a target location holds promise for a variety of disease indications. In order to achieve the full potential that mRNA-based therapies have to offer, there is a need for advanced delivery systems that can deliver the mRNA in an efficient manner to target cells. Targeted delivery allows for reduction of potential side effects and increased payload delivery. 2,3 Nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve organ/cell specificity (through both passive and active targeting methods), payload release control, and solubility improvement. 3 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in particular have emerged as a promising delivery vehicle for mRNA due to their ability to protect the mRNA and achieve targeting specificity. Optimization of LNP formulations has thus become a major effort in the field. \n\nFactors such as the protein corona effect limit an exact understanding of why some formulations effectively target different organs and cells, 4 which makes ''rational'' design of NPs for specific targets challenging. Large-scale NP screening is therefore an important strategy for identifying the most effective formulations, but current methods are low throughput and therefore potentially miss the most promising formulations. 3 mproved methods for large-scale in vivo screening are particularly important because in vitro models cannot accurately model the biodistribution that occurs within the body. However limitations in current in vivo methods include throughput and the use of a large sum of animals and/or use transgenic animal models that do not allow for larger animal models to be used. 5 Therefore, there is a need for a more advanced high-throughput in vivo screening method. \n\nThe recent publication in Nature Biomedical Engineering, titled ''Peptideencoding mRNA barcodes for the highthroughput in vivo screening of libraries of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery,'' addresses this gap with a peptide barcoding assay that, when paired with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), has the ability to screen tissue targeting NP formulations in a highthroughput and in vivo manner. 1 Briefly, this new method leverages different peptide barcodes correlating to different LNPs to enable screening of multiple LNPs within the same mouse.",

Lipid oxidation can occur in unsaturated fatty acid moieties (not present in Comirnaty and mRNA-1273) and with cholesterol, potentially as a result of a hydroperoxide attack, an impurity present in the PEG-group of PEG2000-C-DMG (Jaeger et al., 1994;Wang et al., 2019). Oxidative impurities may also result in oxidation of encapsulated mRNA. The carboxylic ester bonds in lipids, such as DSPC and the ionizable cationic lipids, are susceptible to temperature-and pH-dependent hydrolysis (Fig. 6).\n\nAnother key aspect of LNP stability is physical degradation. There are three main types of physical instability that can occur: aggregation, fusion, and leakage of the encapsulated pharmaceutical ingredient. Aggregation of LNPs during storage and fusion of LNPs has been reported (Ayat et al., 2019;Ball et al., 2016). To increase stability on the shelf, LNPs are often formulated with PEG-lipids (Burke et al., 2013;Ryals et al., 2020). The PEG-molecules at the surface prevent the individual LNPs from aggregating. The other type of physical degradation -leakage of the mRNA-mainly affects the stability of the encapsulated product. Of note, encapsulation efficiencies are typically > 90% and release of the RNA payload from LNPs during storage has not been reported (as measured with the RiboGreen test). mRNA that is not encapsulated ('naked mRNA') is hardly taken up by cells; besides, it degrades rapidly and is, therefore, not available for translation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions -rarely observed upon intramuscular injection of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines-may be related to the PEG-lipids. Therefore, alternative lipids to prevent aggregate formation have been investigated. Introduction of polysarcosine-modified lipids stabilized lipid-based systems against aggregation while reducing the immunostimulatory response (Nogueira et al., 2020). Additional testing is needed to establish whether such PEG-lipid alternatives improve the",

As early as the 1990s, liposomes were being utilized to deliver mRNA cargoes to mice in vivo ; in the proceeding decades, lipid-based systems such as Lipofectamine (Invitrogen; a lipoplexing agent), Stemfect (Stemgent; a lipoplexing mix), and TransIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio LLC; a cationic polymer/lipid formulation) were designed and made commercially available to aid in vitro cell transfection of nucleic acids, including mRNA [ 98 , 99 ]. A number of other technologies, including 'elastic' liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, 'lipobrids' and lipidpolymer hybrid nanoparticles have been developed in the past decade and may be adapted for delivery of nucleic acids [100][101][102][103]. However, these so-called 'soft' lipid nanostructures [104] , i.e. micelles, liposomes and lipoplexes, with generally only one or two different lipid components in their formulation, can suffer from a lack of reproducibility in their production [105] and have low stability. Micellar particles can degrade if diluted below their critical micelle point, for example, and increasing the ratio of incorporated surfactant in order to promote particle stability can further result in increased cytotoxicity [ 104 ]. Lipoplexes have demonstrated little success in in vivo application, owing to particle instability and a broad size distribution, ranging even up to a few microns in diameter [ 106 , 107 ]. Liposomes, meanwhile, generally exhibit low encapsulation efficiency of oligonucleotides [108] , making them impractical for development towards in vivo transport and delivery of nucleic acid vaccines.\n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs)",

The APE lipid nanoparticles (APE-LNPs) were formulated by microfluidics, mixing ethanol and aqueous phases at a 1:3 volumetric ratio using syringe pumps (Pump 33 DDS, Harvard Apparatus), as previously described. 43 The ethanol phase was prepared by solubilizing a mixture of ionizable APE, DOPE, cholesterol, and C14-PEG 2000 at a molar ratio of 50:25:23.5:1.5 and A 9:1 nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) ratio. The aqueous phase contained mRNA suspended in 10 mM citrate buffer at pH 3.2. The APE-LNPs formulated with DOPC and DSPC were prepared by substituting DOPE. The APE-LNPs labeled with DiR were formulated as described above, with an ethanol phase composed of APE, DOPE, cholesterol, DiR, and C14-PEG 2000 at a molar ratio of 50:25:22.5:1:1.5, and the same aqueous phase composition. The concentration of mRNA encapsulated into APE nanoparticles was determined by the Quant-iT RiboGreen assay (ThermoFisher), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The efficacy of mRNA encapsulation into APE-LNPs was calculated by comparing measurements in the absence and presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nanoparticle size, polydispersity (PDI), and \u03b6-potential (ZP) were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). APE-LNP hydrodynamic diameters are reported as the average Z-average of at least two independent measurements. The stability of the APE-LNPs was evaluated by measuring the size of the particles stored at 4 \u00b0C at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 using DLS, as described above.",

Viral vectors, gene guns, electroporation, penetrating peptides, polymers, and liposomes are among the most widespread approaches [82,83]. Naked unformulated mRNA was shown to be expressed in cells [84], however cellular uptake is less than 0.01% [85]. Notably, most of these methods are only suitable for in vitro purposes. \n\nLiposomes are the first delivery approach used in nanopharmaceuticals as a kind of universal carrier for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargoes: proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules [86]. A liposome is a 20-1000 nm formation with one or more lipid bilayer containing aqueous and hydrophobic compartments. In 1994, Harashima et al., demonstrated a positive correlation between the size of such particles and the opsonization and macrophage phagocytosis uptake in vivo [87]. This means that liposome size should be carefully measured for delivering purposes [88]. \n\nTo date, the most common way of delivering mRNA for therapeutic purposes was lipid nanoparticle (LNP) injection. LNP consists of positively charged cationic and ionizable lipids that mediates complexing with negatively charged mRNA. Moreover, such formulation is necessary for cellular uptake and endosomal escape [89,90]. Cationic lipids in LNPs are neutralized with anionic cell lipids and promote nucleic acid entering the cytoplasm through the disruption of LNP complexes. Although LNPs are non-immunogenic and nontoxic in comparison to viral vectors, they still have some cytotoxicity [91] that is dependent on the structure of hydrophilic heads or PEG (polyethylene glycol) modifications of lipids, which are widely used to increase in vivo stability [92]. This may cause membrane damage or vacuolization of the cytoplasm and may affect important cellular pathways and cell cycle stages. There are many new lipids under development for lowering cytotoxic effects without decreasing delivering efficiency. \n\nProducing LNPs is difficult and hardly scalable.",

Many new mRNA vaccines in development are multivalent, which represents a difficulty for the standard assays commonly used to characterize the critical quality attributes of monovalent formulations. Here, we present a multiplexed analytical tool with nucleic acid microarray technology using the VaxArray platform that measures the identity and quantity of mono- and multivalent mixtures of naked mRNA and mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle formulations in under 2 h without any additional preparation steps, such as extraction or RT-PCR. Using a quadrivalent mixture of encapsulated mRNA constructs that encode for four unique proteins in a vaccine formulation, the VaxArray mRNA assay was demonstrated to be highly specific for each mRNA with sensitivity < 1 \u00b5g/mL. The quantification of individual mRNAs within the lipid nanoparticle mixture resulted in a precision of \u226410% RSD and an accuracy of 100 \u00b1 9%.",

Since the freeze-dried formulation prepared via the alcohol dilution-lyophilization method maintained its gene expression efficiency for at least 4 months at 4 \u00b0C, this formulation would be one of the preferable forms of mRNA-LNPs. Stabilization by freeze drying is more important for mRNA-LNPs than siRNA-LNPs since the mRNA-LNPs lose their gene transfection efficiency during the storage for a month (Figure 2), while the siRNA-LNP maintains its gene knockdown activity without lyophilization [21] Zhao et al. evaluated the protein expression activity of lyophilized LNPs that were prepared using an ionizable lipid (TT3) after a long-term storage [26]. Consistent with our observations (Figure 2), the authors also found that the protein expression activity of the lipid-based nanoparticle system decreased to approximately 25% of that of the original preparation in 4 weeks. It was assumed that the functional half-life of the lipid-based nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA is approximately 1-2 weeks. It was also reported that the system lost its in vivo activity in 1 week, even in lyophilized form. In the case of RNA vaccines, it was reported that the production of antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was not changed after the injection of LNPs that had been stored for at least 6 months in suspension form at 4 \u00b0C [27].

While extensive research has focused on lipid composition, the impact of preparation solutions on LNP performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigated the effects of pH, salt type, and concentration across key preparation solutions\u2014mRNA aqueous, dilution, exchange, and storage solutions\u2014on the physicochemical properties, stability, and expression efficiency of SM102-based mRNA/LNPs. Findings revealed that the pH of the mRNA aqueous solution was critical, with a pH of 4 optimizing encapsulation efficiency (EE) and cellular expression. The exchange solution\u2019s pH significantly influenced biodistribution, particularly liver-specific expression following intravenous and intramuscular administration. Sucrose was identified as essential for freeze-thaw stability, with a 300 mM concentration minimizing aggregation and mRNA leakage. Furthermore, preparation solutions were shown to influence the structural integrity of LNPs, impacting their in vivo and in vitro performance. These insights highlight the importance of preparation conditions in optimizing LNP formulations for clinical applications, offering a foundation for enhanced therapeutic design and delivery.

            "text": "The current rapid advancement in ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics research depends on innovations in drug delivery, especially the development of a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-based system. The conventional LNP formulation typically contains four components, including an ionizable cationic lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol or a cholesterol derivative, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, with each contributing to the formulation\u2019s overall stability and effectiveness. Among these four types of lipids, the phospholipid component is often known to provide structural support for the nanoparticles but is also a class of bioactive molecules with strong cell signaling potential. This study explores the possibility of incorporating some known structurally related bioactive phospholipids as the fifth component of a conventional four-component LNP formulation and assesses the impacts of such an approach on the physicochemical properties and biological functions of the mRNA LNP formulation. We screened a library of mRNA LNP formulations containing 7 different structurally related bioactive phospholipids at molar concentrations of 5%, 15% and 30% in addition to a conventional four-component LNP formulation (base). We observed differences in physicochemical properties between the mRNA LNP formulations that could be attributed to both the types of phospholipids examined and the molar concentrations used. Cryo-EM analysis revealed structural similarity between the Base formulation and the other formulations. We also characterized the protein expression level in HeLa cells and picked up a distinct cytokine panel signature for each formulation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Further immunophenotyping analysis showed that most cells that were transfected were CD4+ T cells, and the addition of the different bioactive phospholipids slightly altered cellular tropism. This exploratory study illustrates how adding the bioactive phospholipid can be used to modulate the LNP function, further expanding the design space for RNA LNP formulations and potentiating LNPs for use as RNA therapeutics.",

The results suggested that siRNA-LNP systems have a nanostructured core consisting of a periodic arrangement of inverted micelles with aqueous cores, some of which contain siRNA duplexes. The proposed formation involved three key stages; first, rapid mixing between the aqueous siRNA phase and the lipid ethanol phase, second, the association of cationic lipid with siRNA to form hydrophobic nucleating micellar structures, and third, the coating of the nucleating structures by remaining lipids (potentially the PEG-lipids) as they reach their solubility limits in the ethanol/water system. 185 Further studies have shown that LNP\u2212siRNA systems can exist in a continuum of bilayer and nanostructured micellar structures where the morphology depends on the lipid composition and siRNA content. As the DLin-KC2-DMA content increased beyond 70 mol % siRNA encapsulation efficiencies decreased. This effect was even more pronounced for formulations containing higher percentages of PEG-lipid. Proof of concept data also demonstrated encapsulation of mRNA, plasmid DNA, and gold nanoparticles into LNP systems using microfluidic formulation techniques. 186 More recent studies of lipid mixtures loaded with siRNA and characterized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering at clinically relevant siRNA content levels have proposed a revised LNP structure which includes a combination of siRNA-bilayer structures and an amorphous core. Based on structural observations where the size of the amorphous LNP core depends on the amount of ionizable lipid (20\u221250 mol %), the amorphous core appears to be enriched with the ionizable lipid. 145 The effect of mRNA on the structure of MC3-based LNPs with encapsulated mRNA has also been reported. In a small-angle scattering study, Lindfors and co-workers observed a disordered inverse hexagonal structure in mRNA-loaded LNPs which was absent in unloaded particles.

However, liposomal delivery is plagued with low encapsulation efficiency. To overcome this problem, lipoplexes based on cationic lipids were developed. These cationic lipids interact with negatively charged nucleic acids to yield high encapsulation and delivery efficiency. Nevertheless, lipoplexes suffer from high toxicity caused by the cationic lipids. Besides, the positive charge of cationic lipids could result in their rapid plasma clearance and short circulation time. Different from liposomes and lipoplexes, LNPs are prepared from ionizable lipids that are positively charged at acidic pH (enabling nucleic acid binding) and neutral at physiological pH (eliminating toxicity caused by cationic lipids). 24 LNPs enter into cells via endocytosis, and within acidic endosomes, the ionizable lipids are protonated. This protonation allows the lipids to readily interact with negatively charged endosomal membranes and thereby induce the fusion process for endosome disruption and nucleic acid release, leading to effective delivery (Figure 3A). It should be mentioned that LNPs are multicomponent systems encompassing ionizable lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and pegylated lipid.",

However, existing technologies have limitations that have prevented the reliable analysis of size variants for large nucleic acids and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this work, nucleic acid and LNP aggregation was examined using prototype, low adsorption ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the column\u2019s physicochemical properties. A large difference in aggregate content (17.8 vs 59.7 %) was found for a model messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by different manufacturers. We further investigated the nature of the aggregates via a heat treatment. Interestingly, thermal stress irreversibly decreased the amount of aggregates from 59.7 to 4.1% and increased the main peak area 3.3-fold. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, plasmid DNA topological forms and multimers were separated by analytical SEC. The degradation trends were compared to the data obtained with an anion exchange chromatography method. Finally, unconjugated and fragment antigen-binding (Fab)-guided LNPs were analyzed and their elution times were plotted against their sizes as measured by DLS. Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) was coupled to SEC in order to gain further insights on large species eluting before the LNPs, which were later identified as self-associating LNPs. This study demonstrated the utility of ultrawide pore SEC columns in characterizing the size variants of large nucleic acid therapeutics and LNPs.",

            "text": "In order to benefit from RNA molecules in curing diseases and/or alleviating symptoms, RNA must be delivered properly and protected from degradation by nucleases. Therefore, RNA molecules should be encapsulated or packaged to allow efficient delivery, cellular uptake, and intracellular release, hence improving the desired function of the RNA molecule. \n\nOne approach involves the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are considered among the most advanced and promising non-viral RNA delivery systems for treating a broad range of diseases. LNPs' advantages and disadvantages are based on their components, i.e., structural lipids, cationic ions, stealth lipids, and cholesterol. For instance, using the appropriate ratio of cholesterol stabilizes the structure of the LNPs and interferes with the membrane permeability and elasticity [89,90]. The presence of cationic lipids is important for loading negatively charged nucleic acids. Although these cationic lipids can mediate efficient nucleic acid encapsulation and disrupt the endosomal membrane to enable cytoplasmic delivery, they also induce cytotoxicity and opsonization with plasma proteins, thus raising a safety red flag that indeed limits their use. Instead, pH-sensitive ionizable cationic amino lipids were developed. They are neutral in charge when administered and become ionized after cellular uptake [91]. One example is the ionizable amino lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3), which is one of the LNP components used to deliver the first FDA-approved siRNA to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Coelho et al. [92] identified anti-transthyretin siRNA and encapsulated it in LNPs, generating ALN-TTR02, a drug that silences the transthyretin (TTR) gene, hence decreasing its production. In the phase I clinical trial, they noted an 82% TTR reduction [93]. ALN-TTR02 development was sponsored by Alnylam Pharmaceutics; they also completed two phase II clinical trials (ClinicalTrial.gov",

            "text": "Immunogenicity has been observed with direct inoculation of naked mRNA, as seen in the first naked mRNA vaccine clinical trial by Weide et al. in 2008, where successful injections of autologous mRNA in melanoma patients demonstrated its safety and feasibility. Additionally, an anti-tumour humoral immune response was also elicited in some patients, but clinical regression was not observed (65). These observations could be attributed to the fact that mRNA is often unstable in vivo, undergoing degradation by extracellular RNases before they can be internalized (66). \n\nTo address mRNA stability, delivery strategies include encapsulating mRNA within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), DCs or DC extracellular vesicles (DEVs). LNPs are now widely used as a vehicle for mRNA delivery, and initial iterations were composed of cationic amphipathic lipids that strongly bound the negatively charged mRNA to protect it during delivery. The first major breakthroughs typifying the use of cationic lipids came from an in vitro study by Malone et al., when he successfully transfected Photinus pyralis Luciferase mRNA into human and other animal cells using cationic liposomes as a delivery system (67). In vivo mouse model studies more recently performed by Kranz et al. in 2016, demonstrated that Agencoding mRNAs in complex with liposomes (RNA-LPX) induce robust effector and memory T cell immunity, and tumour rejection. This was due to the liposome facilitating efficient DC uptake upon injection. Additionally, they also initiated a Phase I trial using their RNA-LPX technology, the first ever clinical trial of an mRNA-encapsulated liposome vaccine, a milestone that set the precedent for several following studies using liposome-encapsulated RNA vaccines (68). While they greatly improve mRNA stability, LNPs have been reported to still trigger damaging immunostimulation and oxidative stress (69,70). As such, newer LNP technologies use ionizable lipids, which aid in improved mRNA delivery and safety.",

In the case of mRNA, it was recently shown that LNP disintegration and subsequent mRNA translocation across the endosomal membrane preferentially occur in early endosomes, 20 in which the charge of the endosomal membrane is primarily controlled by phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. 21",

INN Patisiran is approved for polyneuropathy associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) and is used for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR). 103 Patisiran consists of a minimally modified siRNA (for TTR mRNA) and is encapsulated into four lipid constituents: MC3 (ionizable cationic lipid), PEG-DMG (PEG-lipid), cholesterol (sterol), and distearoylphosphatidyl-  choline (DSPC; phospho 10 helper lipid). 1 LNPs are formed by mixing the lipids in ethanol and the nucleic acids in an acidic aqueous solution. Subsequently, ionizable cationic lipid MC3 interacts with negatively charged nucleic acids to form the core. \n\nThere is an enhancement of polarity during the fabrication process, and the more polar lipids (PEG-lipid and DSPC) coat the surface of the LNPs. 104 PEG-DMG is important for LNP size control and stability. 102 Notably, PEG-DMG's sheddable nature allows LNPs to bind to ApoE in the blood, which facilitates the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes through the interaction of ApoE with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). \n\nLNPs have many benefits, such as large RNA cargo capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, redosability (safety), scalability, and ease of modification and functionalization. 94,105",

            "text": "However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergentbased deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. \n\nMolecules 2025, 30, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 46 \n\nwhile both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles.",

To demonstrate the RP-CAD method's applicability for quantifying lipids at various stages of the LNP process regardless of specific process parameters, the impact of the TFR as a production parameter on the LNP attributes was studied using LNPs encapsulating a DNA-based model-siRNA. In addition to the commonly determined attributes, particle size, surface charge, and nucleic acid encapsulation, we simultaneously assessed lipid quantities and lipid molar ratio with the newly developed RP-CAD method. These lipid quantities allow for the calculation of lipid recoveries, providing an indicator of the process performance in LNP purification and thus enabling intensified process characterization.",

            "text": "Naked mRNA molecules are large, hydrophilic, negatively charged, and highly sensitive to nuclease degradation. Due to these characteristics, the mRNA cannot easily pass through the cell membrane and be delivered into the cytoplasm where it can be translated into immunogenic protein. To overcome these hurdles, different types of nanoparticle delivery systems have been developed to protect mRNA from degradation, as well as enable cellular uptake and endosomal escape [15]. \n\nOne of the main approaches to the formulation of mRNA is based on its complexation by electrostatic interactions with cationic components, such as lipids and polymers. Currently, LNPs are the most promising lipid-based nanoparticles used as an mRNA delivery system, as represented in the leading mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection [16,17]. The components of LNP formulations include an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids. Despite their undeniable effectiveness, PEG lipids presented in LNP are suspected to be responsible for the manifestation of some sideeffects after administration in humans and mice [18][19][20]. Thus, the development of mRNA delivery systems without a PEGylated component or mRNA loading optimization are alternatives for obtaining new, efficient, and safer vaccinal formulations. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have been widely studied as nonviral vectors for mRNA delivery [21][22][23][24][25][26]. These hybrid nanoparticles present a polymeric core/lipid shell structure which combines the stability of the hydrophobic polymer and biocompatibility of lipid bilayers [27]. Additionally, the cationic lipid shell facilitates the adsorption of negatively charged mRNA onto the surface of nanoparticles and avoids their aggregation. These hybrid nanoparticles can be prepared by conventional bulk methods in which polymeric nanoparticles are mixed with preformed liposomes or lipid solution [28]. However, the bulk method relies on a multistep procedure and tends to have high batch-to-batch variation [29].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely recognized as crucial carriers of mRNA in therapeutic and vaccine development. The typical lipid composition of mRNA-LNP systems includes an ionizable lipid, a helper lipid, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid, and cholesterol. Concerns arise regarding cholesterol's susceptibility to oxidation, potentially leading to undesired immunological responses and toxicity. In this study, we formulated novel LNPs by replacing cholesterol with phytochemical-derived compounds, specifically ginsenoside Rg2 and its derivative phytosterol protopanaxadiol (PPD), and validated their efficacy as mRNA delivery systems. The mRNA-LNP complexes were manually prepared through a simple mixing process. The biocompatibility of these Rg2-based LNPs (Rg2-LNP) and PPD-based LNPs (PPD-LNP) was assessed through cell viability assays, while the protective function of LNPs for mRNA was demonstrated by RNase treatment. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA delivery and expression in A549 and HeLa cells were analyzed using optical microscopy and flow cytometry. The expression efficiency of Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP was compared with that of commercially available LNPs, with both novel formulations demonstrating superior transfection and EGFP expression. Furthermore, in vivo tests following intramuscular (I.M.) injection in hairless mice demonstrated efficient luciferase (Luc) mRNA delivery and effective Luc expression using Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP compared to commercial LNPs. Results indicated that the efficiency of EGFP and Luc expression in Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP surpassed that of the cholesterol-based LNP formulation. These findings suggest that Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP are promising candidates for future drug and gene delivery systems.",

The results indicate that, in all four systems, the peak positions of the lipid components are in the order of SM-102(+), cholesterol, DSPC, and DMG-PEG, suggesting that the protonated ionizable lipid is closest to the nucleic acid. Previous studies have indicated that under low pH conditions, protonated SM-102 tends to localize at the hydrophilic surface of the nanoparticles. Marketa et al. also found in their study of the spatial distribution of four lipid components in RNA self-assembly systems that ionizable lipids adhere most closely to RNA, while DSPC and PEG are positioned the furthest away [44]. However, during the nucleic acid encapsulation process, protonated SM-102 migrates from the surface of the cluster to the interior of the lipid nanoparticles, encapsulating the nucleic acids, indicating that protonated ionizable lipids play a crucial role in nucleic acid encapsulation. Additionally, the SM-102(+) peak values for the systems LNP_HAc_DNA, LNP_HAc_2DNA, LNP_CA_DNA, and LNP_CA_2DNA are 0.408, 0.442, 0.500, and 0.564, respectively. The radial distribution peaks of ionizable lipids with nucleic acids are higher and more concentrated in citric acid environments, suggesting that citric acid is more favorable for the interaction between ionizable lipids and nucleic acids.

            "text": "Snapshots of the six systems were obtained at three time points: 0 ns, 100 ns, and 300 ns. The self-assembly of the four lipid components in acidic and neutral environments showed notable differences in the final conformation at 300 ns. Initially, the four lipid components were uniformly distributed within the box at 0 ns. Over time, they aggregated into small clusters, which then merged to form larger clusters. \n\nIn the acidic environment, the LNP_HAc system formed numerous small, discrete clusters, with the largest cluster exhibiting a flocculent structure (see Figure 3A). In contrast, the LNP system in the neutral environment formed a single, more regular spherical large cluster (see Figure 3B). This suggests that, in a neutral environment, lipid molecules aggregate into spherical clusters, which, when mixed with acidic nucleic acid solutions, disaggregate into flocculent structures that may facilitate the encapsulation of nucleic acid molecules. To test this hypothesis, a spherical cluster from the neutral environment was subjected to MD simulation in an acidic environment. The resulting snapshots showed that the spherical cluster fragmented during the simulation, supporting the earlier hypothesis (see Figure S1). Comparing the systems with an N/P ratio of 6:1 in acetic acid and citric acid environments (i.e., LNP_HAc_DNA and LNP_CA_DNA), the encapsulation of nucleic acids and the self-aggregation of lipid components occur simultaneously. Subsequently, the lipid clusters merge with the nucleic acid clusters to form nucleic acid nanoparticles (see Figure 3C,D). In studies of the complexation of single-stranded mRNA with lipids, Rissanou et al. observed, through kinetic snapshots and cluster number analysis, that the self-assembly of clusters in the system coincided with the encapsulation of RNA [40,41]. \n\nWhen multiple nucleic acid strands are present and the N/P ratio is reduced to 3:1 (i.e., in the LNP_HAc_2DNA and LNP_CA_2DNA systems), the nucleic acid clusters merge with each other to form larger nanoparticles.",

Using stealth-based nanomaterials is a common strategy for enhancing the stability and prolonging the circulation duration of mRNA molecules [40]. In this context, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) emerges as the gold standard for nanoparticle formation due to the hydrophilic nature of PEG, low cellular toxicity, and high biocompatibility [41]. The concept of PEGylation encompasses the modification of biological molecules through covalent conjugation with PEG. PEGylation modifies the physical and chemical properties of the mRNA compounds, including their conformation, electrostatic binding, and hydrophobicity [42]. This modification results A few parameters of the PEG-Lipids can be adjusted to improve the encapsulation efficiency. For example, the amount of PEG is inversely proportional to the size of the LNP, hence, the higher the PEG content, the smaller the size of the LNP. A higher molecular weight of PEG and a longer lipid chain can increase the circulation time of the LNPs in the biological system.",

The particle architecture is determined by how the various components interact with one another to establish a stable equilibrium through self\u2010assembly. The Coulombic attraction between the anionic oligonucleotide cargo and the ionizable amino lipid within the encapsulation media contributes to the coalescence of the particles, but other interactions are also involved. Prior exploration of amino lipids for mRNA delivery via a traditional medicinal chemistry approach suggests that hydrogen bonding between a hydroxyl headgroup and the mRNA contributes to improved LNP in vivo expression. Herein, expansion of that work culminating in the discovery of a novel squaramide lipid that enables robust LNPs with high levels of expression is described. Molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical evidence both support the hypothesis that the squaramide is making specific interactions with mRNA resulting in particles with a more stable and efficient structure.",

This follows a series of clinical successes beginning with patisiran (Onpattro\u00ae), the first approved RNA interference drug [3,5]. Particularly, the mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines marketed by Moderna and Pfizer, are a great example to show how research and development of drug delivery systems (DDSs) over the years has contributed to the health and welfare of humanity [6,7].\n\nLNPs refer to all nanoparticles composed of lipids, including a variety of classes such as liposomes. Nowadays, the term is often used to refer to stable nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles, particularly in the field of nucleic acid and mRNA DDSs; therefore, this article follows this narrow usage. The strategy for developing LNPs for delivering nucleic acid and mRNA-based therapeutics has been fairly established, and several review articles focusing on the concepts, basic components, and fundamental technologies have already been published [1e4,8e10]. Thus, they are only briefly described here.\n\nIonizable lipids play a critical role in LNPs [11e13]. Dlin-MC3-DMA [14], used in patisiran, SM-102 [15] and SS-cleavable pHactivated lipid-like material (ssPalm) [16,17], which are biodegradable lipids, and lipidoid C12-200 [18e20] are a few examples for this. In addition to the encapsulation of nucleic acids and mRNAs into LNPs, ionizable lipids contribute to efficient endosomal escape and release of nucleic acids and mRNAs from LNPs after uptake by cells ( Fig. 1) [12]. One of the major challenges in designing DDS was that polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification improved the blood stability of nanoparticle formulations after systemic administration, but also inhibited their uptake into target cells [21e23]. A simple strategy to overcome this problem was the development of 1,2",

In the case of LNPs, it has been shown that faceted internal and surface structures form between the nucleic acids and the lipidic components of the carrier, increasing the efficiency of RNA transfection due to a superior capacity to trigger dynamic membrane fusion and endosomal escape [16]. \n\nIf the determination of the particle structure per se is a very complex task, methods to measure the thermal stability and the evolution of surface charge of the nanoparticle vectors in biological environments could provide information about key structural properties and understand the relationship between these and the physical\u2212chemical properties of the nanovaccines and their dynamic changes in biological environments. As practical examples, the thermal stability of the nanocarrier structure can be explored by measuring particle size with DLS thermal ramps and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, changes in the surface charge of the nanocarrier responding to pH changes in physiological environments could be measured by performing a titration with electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). \n\nHighly complex, multicomponent, multifunctional viral and non-viral delivery vectors such as mRNA-LNPs and rAAVs require fit-for purpose robust measurement methods for their characterization and the optimization of their stability [17,18], as summarized in Table 1. Complementary information on particle size, size distribution, concentration, charge, and chemical composition are required to reliably study the effects of pH, incubation time, temperature, and other stress conditions on the stability and function of these complex molecular assemblies.",

            "text": "Although this understanding is gradually forming in the biotherapeutic context for mRNA products [25,[31][32][33], many studies examine only naked mRNA [12,26,34] or use proprietary buffer formulations with closed instrumentation [35,36]. Although informative, unknown impurities may go uninvestigated due to missing components or unpredictable interactions with undisclosed components. Indeed, lipids are important to the mRNA impurity profile as Packer et al. reported the discovery of novel mRNA-lipid impurities, which were undetectable in a CGE method but present by IP-RPLC [25]. Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood. Given the emergence of this modality and the potential for novel impurities, it will be important to establish standard methods to accurately assess known CQAs while also maintaining the means to characterize unknown impurities through customizable methods. \n\nTo address the knowledge gaps of CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC method performance for mRNA-LNPs, we used a large commercial mRNA-LNP product (\u223c4200 b) to systematically evaluate critical method parameters for CGE-LIF and compared them to IP-RPLC. Both methods have been proposed for mRNA quality assessments [27]. In this study, we first examined how common gel additivesurea, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-impacted CGE-LIF resolution of an RNA ladder. Next, we evaluated how LNP disruption affects integrity measurements for the mRNA-LNP. Leveraging these observations, an experimental design was implemented to investigate both main and interaction effects of urea, formamide, and dye percentage. CGE-LIF performance was then compared to IP-RPLC analysis. Finally, a discussion on designing methods for consistency and standardization from a biotherapeutic perspective will be presented.",

Overall, a strong negative correlation between alkyl side chain length and the size of APE-LNPs was observed for all polymers, demonstrat-ing the critical importance of the APE side chain design for their ability to form nanoparticles with lipid excipients (Figures 3B and S4B). \n\nMoreover, the APE-LNPs composed of HL polymers (AA1-HL-3 and AA4-HL-3) showed limited stability over time compared to DL-based polymers (AA1-DL-3 and AA4-DL-3), increasing in size and polydispersity when stored in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for up to 28 days (Figure S6). This data confirm that the APE alkyl side chain length also plays a role in LNP stability, and polymers with short (e.g., C1) or no side chains display limited size stability or tend to form aggregates. 25,29 The surface charge (\u03b6) of APE-LNPs ranged from \u221220 to 10 mV (Figures 3C and S4C ), and a positive correlation was observed between the polymer alkyl side chain length and the \u03b6-potential (Figures 3D and S4D). The mRNA encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the APE-LNPs was between 20 and 95% and also positively correlated with the alkyl side chain length. We hypothesize that APE-LNPs with low EE (<60%) may exhibit a decreased surface charge due to potential interference of the nonencapsulated mRNA. Polymers with side chains containing four or more carbons yielded particles with significantly increased EE (Figures 3E,F and S4E,F).",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been employed for drug delivery in small molecules, siRNA, mRNA, and pDNA for both therapeutics and vaccines. Characterization of LNPs is challenging because they are heterogeneous mixtures of large complex particles. Many tools for particle size characterization, such as dynamic and static light scattering, have been applied as well as morphology analysis using electron microscopy. CE has been applied for the characterization of many different large particles such as liposomes, polymer, and viruses. However, there have been limited efforts to characterize the surface charge of LNPs and CIEF has not been explored for this type of particle. Typically, LNPs for delivery of oligonucleotides contain at least four different lipids, with at least one being an ionizable cationic lipid. Here, we describe the development of an imaged capillary isoelectric focusing method used to measure the surface charge (i.e., pI) of an LNP\u2010based mRNA vaccine. This method is capable of distinguishing the pI of LNPs manufactured with one or more different ionizable lipids for the purpose of confirming LNP identity in a manufacturing setting. Additionally, the method is quantitative and stability\u2010indicating making it suitable for both process and formulation development.",

Notably, six siRNA-based therapeutics have been approved, and many more are in the pipeline. \u22128 mRNA is a negatively charged macromolecule prone to rapid degradation, which is why encapsulation is crucial. 4,9 \u22128 LNP formulations are typically composed of 30\u221250% ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-anchored lipids, 5,9 which are spontaneously formed through the self-assembly between the negatively charged RNA and positively charged lipids. pH-dependent ionizable lipids have been pivotal in the development of lipid nanoparticle\u2212 mRNA formulations for RNA encapsulation with improved efficacy and toxicity profiles compared to permanently charged cationic lipids. 9 However, despite the improved safety profile, these lipids are still associated with high toxicity; thus, both adverse clinical effects and long-term immunogenicity should be taken into consideration. 10,11 \u221214 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally occurring nanoparticles originating from the endosomal system and secreted in variable amounts from almost all cell types. 15,16 They contain a large variety of small RNAs, DNAs, lipids, and proteins, which are known to mediate intercellular communications for both local and long-distance interorgan signaling and communication. 17,18 Thus, EVs have been found to have an intrinsic targeting capacity, an ability to overcome natural barriers, 19 and to exert therapeutic effects. Therefore, EVs are clinically interesting both on their own and as drug delivery entities 18,20 and have been shown to be more efficient in RNA delivery compared to synthetic LNP-based systems. 21 However, cargo loading of EVs remains challenging.",

            "text": "To determine the distribution characteristics of solvent molecules within mRNA-LNPs, the radial distribution functions of nucleic acids with water and ethanol molecules were analyzed. The data indicate that the initial structural stacking between nucleic acids and water molecules is strongest, with g values decreasing with increasing distance, reaching a minimum at an r value of 2 nm (see Figure 6A), where it corresponds to the lipid shell predominantly occupied by cholesterol. Conversely, ethanol molecules exhibit lower distribution near the nucleic acids and cholesterol layers, with the highest distribution occurring at r values of 1 nm between the two layers (see Figure 6B). This suggests that there is a solvent cavity between the nucleic acids and the lipid shell, where water molecules are primarily distributed closer to the nucleic acids, while ethanol molecules are more prevalent on the side further from the nucleic acids. This solvent distribution pattern may influence the stability of mRNA-LNPs and their delivery efficiency in vivo by modulating interactions between nucleic acids and lipids. \n\nparticles formed in a citric acid environment were more conducive to forming bubble structures and had a larger volume, resulting in higher transfection efficiency [37]. This indicates that the acidic environment may not only influence the internal structure of lipid nanoparticles but also affect the strength of interactions between lipids and nucleic acids.",

Determining the intracellular distribution of nucleic acids requires quantitative retention and estimation of their association with different organelles by immunofluorescence microscopy. This is particularly important for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, which depends on endocytic uptake and endosomal escape. However, the current protocols fail to preserve the majority of exogenously delivered nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. To solve this problem, by monitoring Cy5-labeled mRNA delivered to primary human adipocytes via lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we optimized cell fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining of a number of organelle markers, achieving quantitative retention of mRNA and allowing visualization of levels that escape detection using conventional procedures. The optimized protocol proved effective on exogenously delivered siRNA, miRNA, as well as endogenous miRNA. Our protocol is compatible with RNA probes of single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and molecular beacon, thus demonstrating that it is broadly applicable to study a variety of nucleic acids in cultured cells.",

            "text": "LNPs have been developed in the past years for the in vivo delivery of short-interfering RNAs (siRNA) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Recently, they have been tested also for gene editing applications becoming one of the most exploited vehicles for liver targeting, for instance in clinical trials delivering genome editing reagents (Gillmore et al., 2021;Longhurst et al., 2024) (Figure 9D). LNPs are typically composed of four primary elements: phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Kazemian et al., 2022). Phospholipids and cholesterol secure the structural stability of the LNP. PEG lipids have been introduced to coat LNP with PEG molecules to prevent particle aggregation, decrease immunogenicity, and increase the LNP halflife in vivo (Kazemian et al., 2022). Lastly, the use of ionizable cationic lipids has significantly improved the delivery mediated by LNP. Briefly, these lipids are positively charged during LNP production, allowing the interaction and encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids. On the other hand, LNPs are in an uncharged state at a neutral pH, such as when they are delivered in vivo, thus preventing immune system reaction. Once LNPs are internalized into target cells by endocytosis, they become positively charged again due to the lowering of the endosomal pH. This provokes the rupture of the endosome membrane enabling the release of the nucleic acids into the cytosol (Paunovska et al., 2022). Up to now, the efficient encapsulation into LNPs is limited to nucleic acids, which remain in the cytosol and cannot access the nucleus, after delivery to target cells. Since the persistence of nucleic acids in the cytosols is limited in time, LNPs allow for transient delivery of their cargo, overcoming the limitation related to the stable expression of the editing agents by viral vectors. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs are coated with ApoE lipoproteins that interact with the LDLR.",

            "text": "Today, the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines is demonstrated through the development and use of approved vaccines for the COVID-19 virus [1][2][3][4][5][6]. This efficiency now makes it possible to consider using synthetic mRNAs for multiple therapeutic applications such as viral infections, cancer, gene therapy, cell reprogramming, and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9) [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. For these purposes, mRNA delivery systems are required to protect mRNA against nucleases and ultimately to deliver mRNA to the target cells in vivo, to release it intracellularly and to allow for its efficient translation. For vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have demonstrated efficacy to protect synthetic mRNA or self-amplifying mRNA from RNAse degradation and increase their cellular uptake upon intramuscular injection. LNP formulations consisting of (i) one ionizable lipid or polymer containing tertiary amines featuring a pKa < 6.5; (ii) one amphoteric lipid such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DSPC) mimicking the lipid membrane in cells; (iii) cholesterol; and (iv) one polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugate. Besides LNP, cationic liposomes remain attractive vectors for mRNA delivery. For all formulations, the cytosolic delivery of mRNA is a crucial step. Lipoplexes (LX) are mostly prepared by the association of a cationic lipid and a co-lipid. Cationic lipids allow electrostatic interactions with nucleic acids while the co-lipids contribute to reduce cytotoxicity and induce the destabilization of the endosomal membrane that favors mRNA transfer in the cytosol [19].",

            "text": "The advent of ionizable lipids made it possible to develop pharmacologically useful lipid formulations 11 . Specifically, pH-titratable lipids are almost entirely uncharged at the physiological pH of blood but positively charged at the acidic pH of endosomes. These features enable these lipid carriers to interact with negatively charged RNAs and endosomal membranes but prevent disadvantageous rapid clearance and low tolerability. Cationic or ionizable lipids with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipids and helper lipids constitute the main components of lipid nanovehicles used for RNA delivery. PEG-lipids contribute to drug formulation stability during the production process and can shield the surface of lipid nanovehicles from blood components to optimize their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Helper lipids mainly facilitate lipid nanovehicles to escape from endosomes. \n\nWith the development of preparation technology, lipid nanovehicles have been developed from conventional lipoplexes to stabilized nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs), lipopolyplexes, membrane/core nanoparticles (MCNPs), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Therefore, in this review, lipid nanovehicles specifically include lipoplexes, SNALPs, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs. In contrast to classical hollow liposomes, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs contain a solid internal core that encapsulates RNA molecules, and therefore, they show higher kinetic stability and more rigid morphology. In particular, homogeneous LNPs are obtained by large-scale commercial fabrication methods such as T-mixing or microfluidic-mixing technology. Accordingly, LNPs are the most advanced lipid nanovehicles to deliver RNAs developed to date 12 .",

Due to the success of LNP systems, understanding the structure, formulation, and function relationship of the lipid components in LNP systems is crucial for design more effective LNP. Here, we highlight the key considerations for developing an LNP system. The evolution of structure and function of lipids as well as their LNP formulation from the early-stage simple formulations to multi-components LNP and multifunctional ionizable lipids have been discussed.

To address the limitations associated with conventional LNP biodistribution studies, we evaluated the distribution of Heptadecane-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(8-(nonyloxy)-8-oxooctyl)amino)octanoate (Lipid 5), a xenobiotic amino lipid comprising a slightly polar head group and an aliphatic lipid tail. Lipid 5 is distributed within the inner core of LNPs where it assists in mRNA stabilization (Fig. 1). Analysis techniques included quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) due to its capabilities allowing for assessing distribution profiles of intact and dismantled LNPs depending on the use of suitably radiolabeled constituents. This analysis method in combination with traditional metabolism and elimination studies provide an overview of the physiologic fates of Lipid 5 and Lipid 5-containing LNPs. QWBA analysis was performed in male and female rats after intravenous administration of radiolabeled Lipid 5 ([ 14 C]Lipid 5)-containing LNPs encapsulating non-translating factor IX (NTFIX) mRNA. This report includes the results of QWBA performed to assess the distribution of Lipid 5 and its 14 C-containing metabolites ([ 14 C]metabolites) after intravenous administration of an NTFIX mRNA-encapsulating, [ 14 C]Lipid 5-containing LNP. Traditional biodistribution assessments of lipid, mRNA, and expressed protein from an intravenously administered therapeutic LNP of similar lipid composition that encapsulates similarly sized mRNAs were compared to that of the 14 C-containing LNPs.

A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases.",

Thus, scientists have developed viral vector-based and non-viral RNA transport systems to ensure effective RNA delivery that evades RNA decay and increases both the delivery to target cells and immunogenicity. These systems are designed to overcome critical obstacles such as the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion. Concurrent advances in the development of synthetic materials for RNA encapsulation, such as polymers and lipid molecules like LNPs, have triggered research into non-viral-based delivery systems that led to the emergency use authorization and the FDA approval for intramuscularly inoculated LNP-based mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [49]. In the following, we describe the delivery systems currently being used. \n\nThe large size of some mRNAs and their negative charge make them unable to cross the anionic lipid bilayer of cell membranes [50]. Therefore, research has focused on delivery methods including routes of administration, pharmaceutical carriers, and drug packaging to overcome the challenges of mRNA instability, inefficient delivery, and immune activation, paving the way for safe and effective mRNA therapeutics. \n\nSince the first proof-of-concept animal study in 1990 [1], numerous strategies have been explored to overcome the instability and immunogenicity of synthetic mRNAs. Successful intracellular mRNA delivery involves viral and non-viral vehicles. Non-viral vehicles include lipids, lipid-like materials, polymers, and protein derivatives. Lipids are amphiphilic molecules that contain three domains: a polar head group, a hydrophobic tail region, and a linker between the two domains [51]. They can form diverse structures such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), micelles, and liposomes, each with unique characteristics and applications for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs or nucleic acids [52]. Micelles are small (<30 nm), single-layer lipid nanosized particles with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell used successfully to solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs.",

LNPs serve as an integral component of mRNA vaccines by protecting and transporting the mRNA payload into host cells. Despite their prominence in mRNA vaccines, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of the potential application of LNPs for the delivery of DNA vaccines. In this study, we sought to investigate the suitability of leading LNP formulations for the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). In addition, we aimed to explore key differences in the properties of popular LNP formulations when delivering either mRNA or DNA. To address these questions, we compared three leading LNP formulations encapsulating mRNA- or pDNA-encoding firefly luciferase based on potency, expression kinetics, biodistribution, and immunogenicity. Following intramuscular injection in mice, we determined that RNA-LNPs formulated with either SM-102 or ALC-0315 lipids were the most potent (all p-values < 0.01) and immunogenic (all p-values < 0.05), while DNA-LNPs formulated with SM-102 or ALC-0315 demonstrated the longest duration of signal. Additionally, all LNP formulations were found to induce expression in the liver that was proportional to the signal at the injection site (SM102: r = 0.8787, p < 0.0001; ALC0315: r = 0.9012, p < 0.0001; KC2: r = 0.9343, p < 0.0001).

To complex negatively charged mRNA, cationic lipids are perfectly suited as both components spontaneously interact to form lipoplexes [85]. Lipoplex-based delivery of mRNA has two main benefits. First, the mRNA is condensed into particles within the range of microorganisms, resulting in efficient targeting and uptake by professional APCs. Second, in a condensed state, the mRNA is less vulnerable for intracellular and extracellular enzyme-mediated degradation. To develop safe and powerful delivery vehicles suited for mRNA delivery, the mRNA field is currently strongly capitalizing on the vast knowledge gained during the clinical development of small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Efficient systemic delivery of siRNA can be achieved by its encapsulation into so called LNPs, with the first RNAi LNP drug product (Patisiran) been approved by the FDA August 2018 and several others in advanced clinical studies. Lipid based nanoparticles are composed of four different lipids with specialized functions, which are mixed at variable ratios with RNA under acidic conditions. Ionizable lipids or lipid-like materials constitute one of the most critical components of these LNPs and are responsible for mRNA complexation by charge interaction and for endosomal release of mRNA. Compared to earlier lipids bearing a permanent cationic charge, these new generation lipids contain amine groups that are cationic at acidic pH but neutral at physiological pH, which reduces toxicity and improves efficiency.",

            "text": "important asset for mRNA vaccine development [38]. In our mouse immunization study using influenza HA expressing UNR from Trilink, the potency of DOG-IM4 LNPs remained essentially the same over one year of storage in PBS at 4 \u2022 C, based on their capacity  to induce high functional HI antibodies. This initial observation was confirmed in a temperature stress study using hEPO reporter mRNA to provide a rapid readout for in vivo bioactivity. The functional in vivo assay was accompanied by a set of biochemical and biophysical assays including mRNA integrity and encapsulation, particle sizing, and lipid integrity by HPLC-CAD-MS. The hEPO results confirmed that DOG-IM4 LNPs would be stable for at least one week at 25 \u2022 C and for at least 6 months at 4 \u2022 C. In this temperature stress study, the decline of potency of the LNPs over time could not be attributed to a degradation of the LNP lipid components as assessed by RP-HPLC-MS analysis but rather to a degradation of mRNA as assessed by fragment analyzer on a fraction of mRNA extracted from the LNPs. The mRNA degradation was accompanied with an evolution of LNP particle size from 130 nm to 150 nm, suggesting an evolution of the LNP structure. RNA degradation could occur through in-line hydrolytic cleavage and attack by nucleases, oxidizers, and chemical modifiers that may be present in the RNA's environment [63]. In-line hydrolytic cleavage refers to mRNA backbone cleavage by inline attack of ribose 2 \u2032 OH on the neighboring phosphodiester bond. This transesterification reaction, which may be catalyzed by amino lipids able to decrease the pKa of 2 \u2032 OH, relies on the RNA backbone being able to adopt a specific conformation where the 2 \u2032 OH is in line with the leaving 5 \u2032 oxyanion of the phosphodiester [64]. DOG-IM4 was designed with an imidazole group attached to a flexible spacer arm as to enable \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 interactions within the LNPs, not only between neighboring imidazole head groups but also with nitrogenous base rings on mRNA on top of the electrostatic interactions with the mRNA phosphate backbone.

            "text": "A dominant positive band at 260 nm and a sharp negative band at 210 nm characterize the CD spectra of A-form helix RNA. 81 The weak band observed at 295 nm has been identified as the result of the nearest-neighbor interactions. 78 In thermal melting experiments, CD changes are primarily caused by base destacking, leading to the loss of interaction between neighboring bases, which manifests as a decreased magnitude of CD bands. In the free mRNA spectrum of Figure 5A, the most thermally susceptible region appears to be the 295 nm band followed by the 210 nm band. A simplistic interpretation, the unstacking of the single weakest neighboring bases, is the first event observed during mRNA heating (295 nm), leading to further unzipping of longer sequences observed as melting at 210 nm. These events lead into a major helix to coil transition, affecting the whole double helical structure evident at 265 nm. The Hill coefficient has been calculated from sigmoidal CD melting curves as an indication of cooperativity of RNA global unfolding. 82 The Hill coefficient values obtained from the curves of Figure 5D are given in Table 1. These values indicate that cooperativity of mRNA unfolding within the LNP is significantly higher than that of mRNA in solution or in the reheated LNP. We can infer that mRNA encapsulated in the LNP is structured differently and more compact than mRNA in solution or in heat denatured LNP. \n\nA comparison of events occurring in free versus encapsulated mRNA leads to the conclusion that mRNA becomes thermally more stable in its encapsulated form, more effectively preserving its basic CD signature during heating. This observation parallels a pharmaceutical stabilization strategy used for proteins whereby enhanced folded stability may be conferred by favorable formulation conditions. 67 Here, we show that some degree of analogy exists regarding LNP encapsulation conferring enhanced conformational stability to the mRNA molecule. The achievement of the overall pharmaceutical stability of lipid nanoparticles will also require consideration of colloidal stability. This raises some further interesting analogies and contrasts to proteins as net attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or particles can influence pharmaceutical stability.",

The hepatic knockdown efficiency of the target genes and liver toxicity were evaluated. The optimal compositions for the siRNA were different from those for ASO, and different from those for mRNA that were reported in a previous study. Extracellular stability, endosomal escape and cellular uptake appear to be the key processes for the successful delivery of mRNA, siRNA and ASO, respectively. Moreover, the compositions of the LNPs likely contribute to their toxicity.

            "text": "The LNPs utilized in most studies contain a substantial amount of cholesterol (up to 40 mol%). In Kawaguchi et al. (2023), researchers investigated the effect of the cholesterol content on physicochemical properties of LNPs and on the magnitude of expression and distribution of a reporter protein with various routes of administration. In that study, LNPs were obtained with the classic cholesterol content of 40%, as were LNPs with a lowered cholesterol content of 20% and 10%. From the standpoint of physicochemical properties, the nanoparticles of all types turned out to be almost identical. Their sizes ranged from 75 to 140 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution (polydispersity index [PDI] <0.25). It is worth noting that LNPs of the classic composition were smaller compared to the others and had a narrower size distribution. At the same time, the stability of the obtained LNPs decreased with the diminishing proportion of cholesterol: within a week, particles with 10% of cholesterol increased in size while losing encapsulated mRNA. Cholesterol only weakly affects the degree of mRNA encapsulation into nanoparticles. Usually, the correlation between the cholesterol amount and mRNA loading is within systematic error, and therefore it cannot be said definitively that cholesterol increases the loading. A weak correlation between RNA encapsulation and the level of cholesterol in LNPs has been observed only in two studies (Kawaguchi et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2020). In Kawaguchi et al. (2023), the effect of cholesterol was demonstrated the most clearly because concentrations of the other components, except for phospholipid, were fixed. Taking into account their reported experimental errors, encapsulation efficiency remained constant at the ratios used. The only parameter that cholesterol affected is the stability of the resulting nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Currie et al. showed that the formed degradation products appeared as shorter RNA fragments in front of the main peak and could be well monitored, and the relative stability of the mRNA under the various stressed conditions could be assessed [50]. Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression.",

However, these are associated with partial in vivo efficacy and occasional toxicity. To overcome these limitations, there has been significant progress in designing safe and complex reagents for effective in vivo use [38,39,113,114]. Cationic lipids and polymers, with dendrimers, have been extensively utilized in mRNA processing in the past. The use of in vivo small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery as a preferred method has greatly advanced the field of mRNA [115]. Among the most significant and commonly used methods for delivery of mRNA is using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). These LNPs usually comprise three elements: (1) An ionizable cationic lipid that allows self-assembly into units of virus-like size, which facilitates endosomal escape of mRNA into the cytoplasm; (2) a lipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugate that prolongs the half-life duration of formulation; (3) cholesterol, a natural balancing component present in the phospholipids that maintains the structure of the lipid bilayer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that LNPs are an effective in vivo delivery method for siRNA. Systemic delivery of the mRNA-LNP complex which primarily targets the liver by attachment of apolipoprotein E followed by uptake through receptors in hepatocytes [116]. Intradermal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous vaccine routes result in extended expression of mRNA at the injection site. The mRNA mechanism wherein it enters the cytoplasm isn't entirely known for the synthetic liposome nor naturally occurring exosomes. Additional investigation into this field is needed. \n\nThe duration for the in vivo protein formation from mRNA-LNP vaccines may be monitored for differing routes of administration. Intramuscular and intradermal vaccine mRNA-LNP delivery have demonstrated transient effects.",

Multi-detector field flow fractionation (MD-FFF, AF2000 Multiflow FFF (Postnova Analytics, Landsberg am Lech, Germany)) was used, equipped with a multi-angle light-scattering detector (MALS, PN3621) and a UV-Vis absorbance detector (PN3211). MALS was used to assess mRNA-LNP size (radius of gyration, Rg) and size distribution and recovery was determined using the UV absorbance obtained after a direct injection (a measure for the total mass present in the sample) and the UV absorbance from the fraction containing the mRNA-LNPs only. The system was operated according to a published methodology [34]. \n\nTo assess mRNA encapsulation and concentration, we used the Quant-it RiboGreen assay (Invitrogen, R11490, Waltham, MA, USA). Calibration curves (at mRNA concentrations of 0-640 ng/mL) were prepared using the encapsulated mRNA. mRNA-LNPs were assayed at multiple dilutions and both in the presence of 0.5% Triton X (to measure the total mRNA concentration, as Triton X disrupts mRNA-LNPs) and in the absence of Triton X (to measure the unencapsulated mRNA concentration). Finally, mRNA encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was calculated.",

Briefly, an ethanol solution of lipids is mixed with an RNA aqueous solution at an acidic pH using a T-tube or microfluidic mixer. Then, ionizable lipids are protonated and thus form complexes with negatively charged RNAs, as the overall solubility of the lipids is decreased due to ethanol dilution. This complexation leads to the construction of unstable nascent lipid-RNA particles that tend to aggregate until they are diluted in the neutral buffer. This technique applies to many formulation conditions and RNA types and exhibits high RNA encapsulation efficiency (>80%). In contrast to the aqueous compartment surrounded by a lipid bilayer observed in classical liposomes, the formed LNPs have a solid core comprising ionizable cationic lipids and their complexes with RNA payloads, which are coated by a monolayer of structural lipids (i.e., cholesterol, phospholipids) and PEG-lipids 80,88,89 . The technique has been used to produce Onpattro and several other LNPs in the clinical stage of development 60 .",

The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area.

Peroxide values and conjugated diene methods determine the primary oxidative products of lipid oxidation and are commonly used for plant oils and high-fat products. 2-Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and chromatographic methods are used to determine the secondary products of oxidation and are suitable for meat and meat-based products. The fluorometric and sensory analyses are indirect methods. The antioxidant capacity of additives is determined indirectly using the lipid oxidation methods mentioned above or directly based on the free-radical scavenging activity of the antioxidant compounds. Each lipid oxidation and antioxidant capacity methods use different approaches, and one method cannot be used for all foods.

Systematic analysis of different formulations with control variables reveals a kinetically controlled assembly mechanism that governs the payload distribution and capacity in LNPs. These results form the foundation for a holistic understanding of the molecular assembly of mRNA LNPs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are effective vehicles to deliver mRNA vaccines and therapeutics but assessing the mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs is challenging. Here, the authors report that mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations can be quantitatively examined by multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy at the single-nanoparticle level."

As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations...Two distinct icIEF approaches have been developed, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines, particularly those encapsulated in LNPs.

As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations"

Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics."

Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control."

A comprehensive characterization strategy requires the implementation of multiple complementary techniques to assess critical quality attributes of LNPs. \n\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) stands as one of the most widely used methods for determining LNP size distribution and polydispersity. This technique provides rapid assessment of particle size, which directly correlates with in vivo distribution and cellular uptake efficiency. For more detailed analysis, multiangle-DLS (MADLS) offers enhanced resolution for polydisperse samples by collecting scattering data at multiple angles <Paper corpusId=\"245623840\" paperTitle=\"(Markova et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface charge characterization, typically measured as zeta potential through electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), provides critical information about LNP stability and potential interactions with biological systems. This parameter influences cellular uptake mechanisms and circulation time in vivo <Paper corpusId=\"245623840\" paperTitle=\"(Markova et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nFor direct visualization of LNP morphology and structure, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high-resolution imaging capabilities that complement light scattering techniques. TEM can reveal important structural features not detectable by other methods, making it valuable for comprehensive characterization <Paper corpusId=\"258370274\" paperTitle=\"(Niazi, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) provides complementary information to DLS by tracking the movement of individual particles to determine both size distribution and particle concentration. This approach is particularly valuable for detecting subpopulations or aggregates that might be masked in ensemble measurements like DLS <Paper corpusId=\"245623840\" paperTitle=\"(Markova et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMore advanced characterization approaches include analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), which can simultaneously assess size distribution and differentiate between empty LNPs, free mRNA, and mRNA-loaded particles without requiring disruptive sample preparation. This technique offers the unique advantage of detecting both floating and sedimenting fractions in LNP formulations, providing insights into encapsulation efficiency and formulation homogeneity <Paper corpusId=\"270020439\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259110832\" paperTitle=\"(Bepperling et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor single-particle analysis of mRNA packaging and distribution within LNPs, multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) enables detailed examination of both lipid and mRNA content at the individual nanoparticle level. This technique can differentiate between unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs, and mRNA-loaded particles, revealing important insights about payload distribution and encapsulation efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252442332\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSize-separation techniques coupled with multiple detection methods provide additional characterization capabilities. Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) or field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering (FFF-MALS) can measure high-resolution size distributions, particle concentration, and morphology in a single analytical run, though their widespread adoption has been limited by higher costs <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe implementation of these orthogonal characterization techniques is essential for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring product quality. Regulatory agencies like the FDA recommend using complementary methods that apply different measurement principles for validating complex quality attributes, highlighting the importance of a multimodal approach to LNP characterization <Paper corpusId=\"270020439\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            ".AUC is able to detect not only the floating but also the sedimenting fractions in LNP-mRNA formulations.This opens new perspectives in the application of the technique as it could be used not only for size distribution profiling of LNPs, but also to reveal the presence of sedimenting sub-population(s) in the sample and to discriminate the mRNA encapsulated in the LNP formulations from the non-encapsulated free mRNA molecules, or possibly, mRNA-lipid adducts.\n\nThe technique requires a relatively low amount of sample and no sample preparation (apart from dilution step).This is extremely important as it avoids any potential bias in the results that could be introduced by ultrafiltration steps, RNA extraction, or particle disruption that are needed when using other analytical techniques.The simplicity of the sample preparation and the specific detection of the signal from the RNA molecule (using the UV detector at 260 nm) also allow the characterization of LNP-mRNA in physiologically relevant media (Bepperling et al., 2023)."

Their low immunogenicity and capability to deliver a variety of nucleic acids renders them an interesting and complementary alternative to gene therapy vectors like AAVs. An important quality attribute of LNPs is the copy number of the encapsulated cargo molecule. This work describes how density and molecular weight distributions obtained by density contrast sedimentation velocity can be used to calculate the mRNA copy number of a degradable lipid nanoparticle formulation.

It has been challenging to assess mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs, including payload distribution and capacity, which are critical to understanding structure-property-function relationships for further carrier development. Here, we report a method based on the multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) technique to examine mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations at the single-nanoparticle level. By differentiating unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs and mRNA-loaded LNPs via coincidence analysis of fluorescent tags on different LNP components, and quantitatively resolving single-mRNA fluorescence, we reveal that a commonly referenced benchmark formulation using DLin-MC3 as the ionizable lipid contains mostly 2 mRNAs per loaded LNP with a presence of 40%\u201380% empty LNPs depending on the assembly conditions. Systematic analysis of different formulations with control variables reveals a kinetically controlled assembly mechanism that governs the payload distribution and capacity in LNPs. These results form the foundation for a holistic understanding of the molecular assembly of mRNA LNPs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are effective vehicles to deliver mRNA vaccines and therapeutics but assessing the mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs is challenging. Here, the authors report that mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations can be quantitatively examined by multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy at the single-nanoparticle level."

Ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-IP HPLC) has emerged as a particularly effective method for this purpose, offering the ability to not only quantify the nucleic acid content but also assess its integrity and purity.\n\nRP-IP HPLC is especially valuable for identifying impurities formed through lipid-mRNA reactions that would typically go undetected using traditional mRNA purity analytical techniques. This capability is crucial for comprehensive quality assessment, as these impurities could potentially affect product stability and efficacy in nucleic acid-based medicines. <Paper corpusId=\"264660901\" paperTitle=\"(Packer et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nRecent advances in analytical methodology have further enhanced the utility of ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RP LC) for analyzing mRNA in LNP formulations. These methods can effectively separate the mRNA cargo from other LNP components based on charge and hydrophobicity, providing valuable information for quality control during the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. <Paper corpusId=\"277729479\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nA significant innovation in this field is the development of detergent-based deformation processes that enable direct measurement of nucleic acid payloads. This approach uses a specialized mobile phase containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol to dissolve intact LNP samples into their individual components, allowing for direct injection and analysis. The resulting IP-RP LC method provides sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and deliver information on mRNA quality alongside quantification, all within a relatively brief 12-minute analysis. <Paper corpusId=\"277729479\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"275992112\" paperTitle=\"(Imiolek et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFor formulations containing multiple nucleic acid components, such as those with nuclease mRNA and guide RNA, specialized analytical approaches are necessary. The detergent disruption method followed by separation on an octadecyl reversed-phase column using a fast gradient has shown reproducible results, with lipids and surfactants efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, an online size exclusion chromatography (SEC) disruption analysis using an alcohol and detergent-containing mobile phase has demonstrated the ability to universally deformulate LNP samples, providing a high-throughput platform method with a 5-minute separation time. <Paper corpusId=\"275992112\" paperTitle=\"(Imiolek et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBoth the IP-RP and SEC approaches facilitate multiattribute analysis, providing information beyond simple quantitation. While IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, SEC informs on size variants, reducing the analytical workload required for comprehensive characterization. These easy-to-adopt liquid chromatography-based assays represent valuable additions to the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics. <Paper corpusId=\"275992112\" paperTitle=\"(Imiolek et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond chromatographic techniques, functional assays provide complementary information about payload integrity. Cell-free protein expression systems can be employed to evaluate mRNA expression levels following extraction from LNPs, offering insights into functional integrity that may not be apparent from chromatographic analysis alone. When combined with techniques like HPLC-ELSD for lipid integrity assessment, these methods provide a comprehensive approach to post-manufacture monitoring of LNP stability and efficacy. <Paper corpusId=\"278107072\" paperTitle=\"(Forrester et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "Therapeutic drugs and multivalent vaccines based on the delivery of mRNA via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technologies are expected to dominate the biopharmaceutical industry landscape in the coming years. Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics."

These methods not only reduce analytical time and sample consumption but also provide insights into the complex interactions between lipid components and nucleic acid payloads that may not be apparent from separate analyses.\n\nA particularly promising integrated approach is multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS), which enables examination of both mRNA and lipid contents at the single-nanoparticle level. This technique can differentiate between unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs, and mRNA-loaded LNPs through coincidence analysis of fluorescent tags on different LNP components.

Unlike many other techniques, AUC can detect both floating and sedimenting fractions, enabling discrimination between mRNA encapsulated in LNPs, non-encapsulated free mRNA molecules, and potentially mRNA-lipid adducts. A significant advantage of AUC is that it requires minimal sample preparation beyond simple dilution, avoiding potential biases introduced by ultrafiltration, RNA extraction, or particle disruption steps that are necessary for other analytical techniques <Paper corpusId=\"270020439\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This method can differentiate between LNPs containing different types or concentrations of ionizable lipids, aiding in verification of LNP identity during manufacturing. As a quantitative approach, icIEF provides insights into LNP stability under various conditions, including different storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development <Paper corpusId=\"276512626\" paperTitle=\"(Ghizzani et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nComprehensive post-manufacture monitoring of LNPs requires integrated approaches that assess both lipid and payload integrity.

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are effective vehicles to deliver mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. It has been challenging to assess mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs, including payload distribution and capacity, which are critical to understanding structure-property-function relationships for further carrier development. Here, we report a method based on the multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) technique to examine mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations at the single-nanoparticle level. By differentiating unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs and mRNA-loaded LNPs via coincidence analysis of fluorescent tags on different LNP components, and quantitatively resolving single-mRNA fluorescence, we reveal that a commonly referenced benchmark formulation using DLin-MC3 as the ionizable lipid contains mostly 2 mRNAs per loaded LNP with a presence of 40%\u201380% empty LNPs depending on the assembly conditions. Systematic analysis of different formulations with control variables reveals a kinetically controlled assembly mechanism that governs the payload distribution and capacity in LNPs. These results form the foundation for a holistic understanding of the molecular assembly of mRNA LNPs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are effective vehicles to deliver mRNA vaccines and therapeutics but assessing the mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs is challenging. Here, the authors report that mRNA and lipid contents in LNP formulations can be quantitatively examined by multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy at the single-nanoparticle level."

Their low immunogenicity and capability to deliver a variety of nucleic acids renders them an interesting and complementary alternative to gene therapy vectors like AAVs. An important quality attribute of LNPs is the copy number of the encapsulated cargo molecule. This work describes how density and molecular weight distributions obtained by density contrast sedimentation velocity can be used to calculate the mRNA copy number of a degradable lipid nanoparticle formulation. The determined average copy number of 5 mRNA molecules per LNP is consistent with the previous studies using other biophysical techniques, such as single particle imaging microscopy and multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS)."

By employing coincidence and quantitative analysis of fluorescent tags on various LNP components, CICS can effectively differentiate between unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs, and mRNA-loaded LNPs. The method has revealed critical insights about payload distribution in common formulations, demonstrating that certain benchmark formulations using DLin-MC3 as the ionizable lipid typically contain mostly two mRNAs per loaded LNP with a significant proportion (40-80%) of empty LNPs depending on assembly conditions <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252442332\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This level of detail about molecular assembly mechanisms cannot be obtained through conventional bulk analysis techniques.\n\nImaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF) has emerged as another valuable advanced technique for LNP characterization. Two distinct icIEF methods have been developed that provide complementary information about LNP quality and stability. Method A, utilizing 9 M urea as an additive, produces characteristic peak patterns that change substantially when stress is applied to samples, providing detailed information about stability. This method can even reveal fine structural details potentially related to the number of mRNA molecules within individual LNPs. Method B, using a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea, offers high repeatability of isoelectric point values (<0.5%) and is less affected by particle size variations. Both methods demonstrate linear correlation between peak area and mRNA content with good repeatability (2-8% relative standard deviation) <Paper corpusId=\"251808672\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe icIEF technique can effectively evaluate the surface charge of LNP-mRNA formulations and differentiate between LNPs containing different types or concentrations of ionizable lipids. This capability makes icIEF particularly useful for verifying LNP identity during manufacturing processes and providing quantitative insights into stability under various conditions, including different storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions <Paper corpusId=\"276512626\" paperTitle=\"(Ghizzani et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ability to detect batch-to-batch variability makes icIEF an important tool for quality control in production settings.\n\nFor comprehensive size analysis coupled with multiple detection methods, size-separation systems using size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) or field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering (FFF-MALS) enable measurement of high-resolution size distributions, particle concentration, and morphology in a single analytical run. Despite these advantages, wider adoption of these technologies has been limited by their higher cost <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese emerging analytical technologies collectively represent a significant advancement beyond conventional characterization methods, offering unprecedented insights into LNP structure, composition, and stability that are essential for optimizing formulation, manufacturing, and quality control processes for nucleic acid therapeutics.",

It has been challenging to assess mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs, including payload distribution and capacity, which are critical to understanding structure-property-function relationships for further carrier development.

By differentiating unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs and mRNA-loaded LNPs via coincidence analysis of fluorescent tags on different LNP components, and quantitatively resolving single-mRNA fluorescence, we reveal that a commonly referenced benchmark formulation using DLin-MC3 as the ionizable lipid contains mostly 2 mRNAs per loaded LNP with a presence of 40%\u201380% empty LNPs depending on the assembly conditions. Systematic analysis of different formulations with control variables reveals a kinetically controlled assembly mechanism that governs the payload distribution and capacity in LNPs.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are effective vehicles to deliver mRNA vaccines and therapeutics but assessing the mRNA packaging characteristics in LNPs is challenging.

                            "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability."

                            "In addition, icIEF can be employed to assess the surface charge of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines (Loughney et al., 2019(Loughney et al., , 2602(Loughney et al., -2609)). This technique is capable of differentiating the pI of LNPs that contain one or more types of ionizable lipids, aiding in the verification of LNP identity during manufacturing processes. As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations",
                            "Two distinct icIEF approaches have been developed, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines, particularly those encapsulated in LNPs. These methods are effective for characterising the stability of mRNA-loaded LNPs under different conditions, such as varied storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, and are capable of detecting batch-to-batch variability."
