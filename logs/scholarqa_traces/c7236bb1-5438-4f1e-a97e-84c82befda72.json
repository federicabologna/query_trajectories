            "abstract": "Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in continuous bioprocessing as a cost-optimised production strategy, driven by a rising global requirement for recombinant proteins used as biological drugs. This strategy could provide several benefits over traditional batch processing, including smaller bioreactors, smaller facilities, and overall reduced plant footprints and investment costs. Continuous processes may also offer improved product quality and minimise heterogeneity, both in the culture and in the product. In this paper, a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, was used to test the recombinant protein expression in an Escherichia coli strain with industrial relevance grown in chemostat. An important factor in enabling stable productivity in continuous cultures is the carbon source. We have studied the viability and heterogeneity of the chemostat cultures using a chemically defined medium based on glucose or glycerol as the single carbon source. As a by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol is expected to become a sustainable alternative substrate to glucose. We have found that although glycerol gives a higher cell density, it also generates higher heterogeneity in the culture and a less stable recombinant protein production. We suggest that manipulating the balance between different subpopulations to increase the proportion of productive cells may be a possible solution for making glycerol a successful alternative to glucose.",

                    "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) has been steadily increasing since the 1980s, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry, with white and red biotechnology accounting for most of the market [1]. Bacterial expression systems are an attractive alternative to the more expensive or slow growing yeast or mammalian cell culture systems. Escherichia coli alone accounts for the production of 30-40% of proteins approved for therapeutic use [2]. Its well-characterised genome, the existence of many commercially available strains and their relatively low price, the high protein expression rates and the ease of performing genomic modifications to ensure high quality products explain the E. coli dominance amongst other microorganisms [1,3,4]. \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous operation was also expected in, red biotechnology, to increase productivity, operational flexibility and the response to high market demands, following the trend demonstrated in the food, chemical and petrochemical industries. However, there was no such trend, and currently there are only a few continuous processes implemented using mammalian cells [3]. The use of microbial cells in continuous production modes at industrial scale remains uncommon, except for insulin production with Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]. \n\nThe most attractive characteristics of using continuous bioreactors (chemostats) are their high space-time yield, increased productivity, reduced protein production costs and lower space requirements. Moreover, in continuous bioreactors, the microorganisms' growth rate and the media composition (on which the protein production rate depends) are controlled to achieved \"balanced growth\" [6]. Thus, the optimisation of continuous cultures for RPP requires careful consideration of these two issues: the nutrient that limits growth and the microbial growth rate. \n\nContinuous cultures should theoretically obtain products of more consistent quality than fed-batch processes [7]. Whereas in batch processing, product quality and productivity might be a trade-off, continuous biomanufacturing gives favourable recombinant protein characteristics [8]. In addition, chemostats allow for direct comparison between different experimental set-ups and eliminate some of the scale-up issues common for batch and fed-batch processes [9]. Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol.",

M. Mitchell, V. Gogulancea, Wendy Smith, A. Wipat, I. D. Ofi\u0163eru\n## Abstract\nRecently, there has been a resurgence of interest in continuous bioprocessing as a cost-optimised production strategy, driven by a rising global requirement for recombinant proteins used as biological drugs. This strategy could provide several benefits over traditional batch processing, including smaller bioreactors, smaller facilities, and overall reduced plant footprints and investment costs. Continuous processes may also offer improved product quality and minimise heterogeneity, both in the culture and in the product. In this paper, a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, was used to test the recombinant protein expression in an Escherichia coli strain with industrial relevance grown in chemostat. An important factor in enabling stable productivity in continuous cultures is the carbon source. We have studied the viability and heterogeneity of the chemostat cultures using a chemically defined medium based on glucose or glycerol as the single carbon source. As a by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol is expected to become a sustainable alternative substrate to glucose. We have found that although glycerol gives a higher cell density, it also generates higher heterogeneity in the culture and a less stable recombinant protein production. We suggest that manipulating the balance between different subpopulations to increase the proportion of productive cells may be a possible solution for making glycerol a successful alternative to glucose.\n## Introduction\nRecombinant protein production (RPP) has been steadily increasing since the 1980s, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry, with white and red biotechnology accounting for most of the market [1]. Bacterial expression systems are an attractive alternative to the more expensive or slow growing yeast or mammalian cell culture systems. Escherichia coli alone accounts for the production of 30-40% of proteins approved for therapeutic use [2]. Its well-characterised genome, the existence of many commercially available strains and their relatively low price, the high protein expression rates and the ease of performing genomic modifications to ensure high quality products explain the E. coli dominance amongst other microorganisms [1,3,4]. \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous operation was also expected in, red biotechnology, to increase productivity, operational flexibility and the response to high market demands, following the trend demonstrated in the food, chemical and petrochemical industries. However, there was no such trend, and currently there are only a few continuous processes implemented using mammalian cells [3]. The use of microbial cells in continuous production modes at industrial scale remains uncommon, except for insulin production with Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]. \n\nThe most attractive characteristics of using continuous bioreactors (chemostats) are their high space-time yield, increased productivity, reduced protein production costs and lower space requirements. Moreover, in continuous bioreactors, the microorganisms' growth rate and the media composition (on which the protein production rate depends) are controlled to achieved \"balanced growth\" [6]. Thus, the optimisation of continuous cultures for RPP requires careful consideration of these two issues: the nutrient that limits growth and the microbial growth rate. \n\nContinuous cultures should theoretically obtain products of more consistent quality than fed-batch processes [7]. Whereas in batch processing, product quality and productivity might be a trade-off, continuous biomanufacturing gives favourable recombinant protein characteristics [8]. In addition, chemostats allow for direct comparison between different experimental set-ups and eliminate some of the scale-up issues common for batch and fed-batch processes [9]. Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol.",

Due to the wide range of effects in humans, any disruption in hGH secretion could have serious consequences. This highlights the clinical importance of hGH production in the treatment of different diseases associated with a deficiency of this hormone. The production of recombinant mature hormone in suitable hosts and secretion of this therapeutic protein into the extracellular space can be considered as one of the best cost-effective approaches not only to obtain the active form of the protein but also endotoxin-free preparation. Since the natural growth hormone signal peptide is of eukaryotic origin and is not detectable by any of the Escherichia coli secretory systems, including Sec and Tat, and is therefore unable to secrete hGH in the prokaryotic systems, designing a new and efficient signal peptide is essential to direct hGh to the extracellular space. Results In this study, using a combination of the bioinformatics design and molecular genetics, the protein A signal peptide from Staphylococcus aureus was modified, redesigned and then fused to the mature hGH coding region. The recombinant hGH was then expressed in E. coli and successfully secreted to the medium through the Sec pathway. Secretion of the hGH into the medium was verified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Recombinant hGH was then expressed in E. coli and successfully secreted into cell culture medium via the Sec pathway. The secretion of hGH into the extracellular medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the addition of glycine was shown to improve hGH secretion onto the culture medium. Equations for determining the optimal conditions were also determined. Functional hGH analysis using an ELISA-based method confirmed that the ratio of the active form of secreted hGH to the inactive form in the periplasm is higher than this ratio in the cytoplasm. Conclusions Since the native signal protein peptide of S. aureus protein A was not able to deliver hGH to the extracellular space, it was modified using bioinformatics tools and fused to the n-terminal region of hGh to show that the redesigned signal peptide was functional.",

The use of E. coli as an expression host has several advantages including the possibility of easy manipulation of bacteria, low growth cost, rapid cell growth and the possibility of culturing high-density cells, which together make it an ideal system, especially from economic view compared to other expression systems [19]. \n\nDuring the cytoplasmic expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli, a single methionine is necessarily added to its N-terminal region. This may not be a problem for industrial enzymes, but in the case of recombinant proteins with pharmaceutical use, in addition to causing unwanted side effects, it is shown that it may stimulate the immune system and produce antibodies against these proteins [31]. Although this methionine can be removed using enzymatic reactions, its removal might impose some problems and additional costs on the system for their mass production, which is not desirable [20]. \n\nA major solution to overcome this problem in E. coli is the secretion of recombinant proteins into the culture medium using a suitable secretory signal peptide. Extracellular production of recombinant proteins has many advantages. The release of the recombinant proteins into the culture medium, in addition to reducing costs in the industry, eliminates the need to disrupt the host cell to extract and purify the proteins. As a result, proteases as well as endotoxins are not released into the environment. In addition, by continuously producing target proteins in the host, more recombinant proteins can be obtained in the fermenter. Although there are advantages to expressing proteins as periplasmic or cytoplasmic, each has disadvantages that limit the use of these methods, such as creating insoluble forms as inclusion body in the cytoplasm or obtaining small amounts of protein in the periplasmic method due to the limited capacity of the periplasm in the E. coli.",

Rigi, Amin Rostami, Habib Ghomi, G. Ahmadian, V. S. Mirbagheri, Meisam Jeiranikhamenh, M.

A variety of expression hosts has been used for production of hGH including mammalian, yeast and bacterial cells [16][17][18]. The use of E. coli as an expression host has several advantages including the possibility of easy manipulation of bacteria, low growth cost, rapid cell growth and the possibility of culturing high-density cells, which together make it an ideal system, especially from economic view compared to other expression systems [19]. \n\nDuring the cytoplasmic expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli, a single methionine is necessarily added to its N-terminal region. This may not be a problem for industrial enzymes, but in the case of recombinant proteins with pharmaceutical use, in addition to causing unwanted side effects, it is shown that it may stimulate the immune system and produce antibodies against these proteins [31]. Although this methionine can be removed using enzymatic reactions, its removal might impose some problems and additional costs on the system for their mass production, which is not desirable [20]. \n\nA major solution to overcome this problem in E. coli is the secretion of recombinant proteins into the culture medium using a suitable secretory signal peptide. Extracellular production of recombinant proteins has many advantages. The release of the recombinant proteins into the culture medium, in addition to reducing costs in the industry, eliminates the need to disrupt the host cell to extract and purify the proteins. As a result, proteases as well as endotoxins are not released into the environment. In addition, by continuously producing target proteins in the host, more recombinant proteins can be obtained in the fermenter. Although there are advantages to expressing proteins as periplasmic or cytoplasmic, each has disadvantages that limit the use of these methods, such as creating insoluble forms as inclusion body in the cytoplasm or obtaining small amounts of protein in the periplasmic method due to the limited capacity of the periplasm in the E. coli.",

The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.",

The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

Smolskaya, Y. A. Logashina, Y. Andreev\n## Abstract\nBefore utilization in biomedical diagnosis, therapeutic treatment, and biotechnology, the diverse variety of peptides and proteins must be preliminarily purified and thoroughly characterized. The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is considered as a first-choice heterologous host organism for the expression of recombinant protein. The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

            "abstract": "Background Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. However, challenging proteins are often produced with low titres or as inclusion bodies, and the manufacturing process needs to be developed individually for each protein. Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

K\u00f6ppl, Wolfgang Buchinger, G. Striedner, M. Cserjan\u2010Puschmann\n## Abstract\nBackground Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. However, challenging proteins are often produced with low titres or as inclusion bodies, and the manufacturing process needs to be developed individually for each protein. Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

                    "text": "However, E. coli a bacterial expression host is still a choice of system due to its well characterized genetics, rapid growth rate and use of inexpensive substrates for cultivations [11,12,13]. Many proteins of vaccine or therapeutic use are produced in E. coli using batch and fed-batch fermentation process [11][12][13][14]. It would be very useful if the optimized production as well as purification processes could be easily scaled up to an industrial scale for the bioprocess industry. Fermentation media, mode of fermentation, scale up and culture conditions are the most significant factors in a production process. Media composition especially with the essential carbon and nitrogen components is optimized to produce large amount of desired product. Fed-batch fermentation is a common technique in this regard to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins [14,15,16]. Increasing the scale of production is usually associated with reduction in the desired product yield due to the complexity associated with fermentation process. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the scaling up of laboratory scale fermentation process and apply suitable strategy in order to enhance the productivity of the desired recombinant protein on the large scale. \n\nHigh-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulates as insoluble, inactive aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies in vivo [17,18,19]. Although the recombinant protein expression in the form of IBs has advantages, the inactive recombinant proteins need to be converted into soluble and correctly folded proteins [20]. The solubilization of IBs was carried out using higher concentration of denaturing agent which must be removed using refolding processes to obtain biologically active recombinant product for vaccine studies. In recent years, several refolding techniques such as rapid dilution, dialysis, diafiltration, high pH solubilization and on column refolding using chromatographic techniques have been used for recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins [17,20,21,22]. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has emerged as a powerful technique for purification of recombinant proteins [22].",

These findings establish that the DIII proteins in combination with adjuvant are immunogenic, which suggests that refolded and purified DIII proteins can be a potential vaccine candidates.\n## Introduction\nHowever, E. coli a bacterial expression host is still a choice of system due to its well characterized genetics, rapid growth rate and use of inexpensive substrates for cultivations [11,12,13]. Many proteins of vaccine or therapeutic use are produced in E. coli using batch and fed-batch fermentation process [11][12][13][14]. It would be very useful if the optimized production as well as purification processes could be easily scaled up to an industrial scale for the bioprocess industry. Fermentation media, mode of fermentation, scale up and culture conditions are the most significant factors in a production process. Media composition especially with the essential carbon and nitrogen components is optimized to produce large amount of desired product. Fed-batch fermentation is a common technique in this regard to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins [14,15,16]. Increasing the scale of production is usually associated with reduction in the desired product yield due to the complexity associated with fermentation process. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the scaling up of laboratory scale fermentation process and apply suitable strategy in order to enhance the productivity of the desired recombinant protein on the large scale. \n\nHigh-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulates as insoluble, inactive aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies in vivo [17,18,19]. Although the recombinant protein expression in the form of IBs has advantages, the inactive recombinant proteins need to be converted into soluble and correctly folded proteins [20]. The solubilization of IBs was carried out using higher concentration of denaturing agent which must be removed using refolding processes to obtain biologically active recombinant product for vaccine studies. In recent years, several refolding techniques such as rapid dilution, dialysis, diafiltration, high pH solubilization and on column refolding using chromatographic techniques have been used for recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins [17,20,21,22]. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has emerged as a powerful technique for purification of recombinant proteins [22].",

These drawbacks include lack of suitable secretion systems and limited post translational modifications (PTMs; e.g., glycosylation is not trivial in bacterial systems). Moreover, E. coli produces pyrogenic endotoxins, although various methods can be employed for their removal, 110 adding additional costs to the DSP. \n\n3.1.2. Yeast.

Walter, Rashmi Rashmi, Rainer Haag, S. Kubick\n## Abstract\nThroughout history, we have looked to nature to discover and copy pharmaceutical solutions to prevent and heal diseases. Due to the advances in metabolic engineering and the production of pharmaceutical proteins in different host cells, we have moved from mimicking nature to the delicate engineering of cells and proteins. We can now produce novel drug molecules, which are fusions of small chemical drugs and proteins. Currently we are at the brink of yet another step to venture beyond nature\u2019s border with the use of unnatural amino acids and manufacturing without the use of living cells using cell-free systems. In this review, we summarize the progress and limitations of the last decades in the development of pharmaceutical protein development, production in cells, and cell-free systems. We also discuss possible future directions of the field.\n## Escherichia coli.\nThe dominating organism of choice for recombinant protein production since the 1980s has been E. coli. Regarding pharmaceutical protein E. coli production, still accounts for 25% of marketed pharmaceutical proteins (Figure 2.), as such, it still is an important industrial host for many processes. 101 \u2212105 Recent advances in glycosylation of heterologous proteins, the addition of disulfide bonds in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic space, and the expression of complex proteins highlight the importance of this production host for the production of pharmaceutical proteins. 106  such, E. coli is an excellent choice for the initial effort to produce a recombinant protein. 107 A starting guide has been developed in the form of a consensus protocol for when little is known about whether the target protein can be recombinantly expressed in soluble and active form (i.e., expressibility). 108 nother advantage is the culture conditions, which at large scale can be significant, since E. coli can be cultivated on relatively cheaply defined media (e.g., glucose, ammonia phosphate and some minerals) and strategies for low-cost production have been developed. 108,109 On the other hand, due to its evident drawbacks, mammalian expression systems have advanced faster for the production of pharmaceutical proteins. These drawbacks include lack of suitable secretion systems and limited post translational modifications (PTMs; e.g., glycosylation is not trivial in bacterial systems). Moreover, E. coli produces pyrogenic endotoxins, although various methods can be employed for their removal, 110 adding additional costs to the DSP. \n\n3.1.2. Yeast. Despite recent efforts to produce pharmaceutical proteins in Kluyveromyces lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica, 111 only three other yeasts, Hansenula polymorpha, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Komagataella pastori, are currently utilized for the production of marketed pharmaceutical proteins (Figure 2).",

On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

Biopharmaceuticals derived from cell culture tend to be expensive because of lower yields compared to bacterially expressed competitors and numerous issues with the scalability of production. Particular limitation of scalability pertains to delivery of expression vectors to the cell culture. Natural and efficient way to deliver foreign DNA or RNA to cell is a viral infection.

Results: Viable genome of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) was constructed. The G-CSF gene was synthesized de novo.

Industrial pharmaceutical biotechnology offers drugs required in medicine and research, which either cannot be obtained in other way besides heterologous expression, or their isolation from natural sources incurs high economic costs. For the large-scale production of recombinant proteins, the key features of the suitable expression system (and, in a broader sense, technology platform) include scalability of technology, yields of the protein product, and costs of production. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host for the production of recombinant proteins including the industrial technologies. However, some valuable proteins cannot be produced in a biologically active form in bacteria. These include, among others, the erythropoietin and the anti-hemophilic factor VIII, which are produced for medical use in the mammalian cell cultures. For other pharmacologically active proteins, such as G-CSF, a variety of production systems are available-employing expression in bacteria, yeast, plants, and cultured animal cells. Still, expression in homologous host often provides product with better properties for the end-user. For example, one form of the G-CSF produced in industrial scales in the E.coli is present in the market with an international non-proprietary name (INN) \"Filgrastim\" and a large number of patented brand marks. Different form of G-CSF is produced in the in vitro cultured CHO cells, which are transformed with the eukaryotic expression plasmid. This kind of G-CSF has INN \"Lenograstim,\" whereas Filgrastim lacks glycosylation and bears non-natural formylmethionine residue at the N-terminus. Lenograstim is fully equivalent to the 174 aa natural human G-CSF. Lenograstim has greater potency compared to Filgrastim, probably because it is more stable to proteolysis (Ataergin et al., 2008). \n\nExpression vectors constitute crucial parts of the technological platforms for production of recombinant proteins.",

In this context, the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisae, diverse mammalian cell lines, insect cells and whole plant and animals (as transgenic systems) are being incorporated to the protein production scenario [1], and many of these products have been already approved for use as protein drugs [2]. Other (less conventional) yeast species and a more limited number of species of filamentous fungi [3], molds [4], moss [5], algae [6] and protozoa [7] are also under development as potential suppliers of recombinant proteins. The engineering of such systems could represent a promising way to the cost effective production of high quality protein versions that biotechnology and biomedical industries are steadily demanding. The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9]",

In this context, the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisae, diverse mammalian cell lines, insect cells and whole plant and animals (as transgenic systems) are being incorporated to the protein production scenario [1], and many of these products have been already approved for use as protein drugs [2]. Other (less conventional) yeast species and a more limited number of species of filamentous fungi [3], molds [4], moss [5], algae [6] and protozoa [7] are also under development as potential suppliers of recombinant proteins. The engineering of such systems could represent a promising way to the cost effective production of high quality protein versions that biotechnology and biomedical industries are steadily demanding. The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9]",

Antimicrobial Peptides (AMP) have garnered interest as a viable solution to this grave issue and are being explored for their potential antimicrobial applications. Given their low bioavailability in nature, tailoring new AMPs or strategizing approaches for increasing the yield of AMPs, therefore, becomes pertinent. The present review focuses on biotechnological interventions directed towards enhanced AMP syn-thesis and revisits existing genetic engineering and synthetic biology strategies for production of AMPs. This review further underscores the importance and potential applications of advanced gene editing technologies for the synthesis of novel AMPs in future.",

                    "text": "Recombinant DNA technology has often been considered as the most effective method for enhanced production of proteins, peptides or enzymes. The technology proves to be advantageous not just regarding reduced time and wellestablished protocols, but also reduced production costs and easy scale up. Genes expressing the target protein/peptide of interest are cloned into specific vectors for expression in host cellular expression systems. Bacteria and yeast are the most widely used host systems for the expression of recombinant products [11]. In case of AMPs as well, these two expression hosts have been reported to produce more than 95% of the heterologously expressed AMPs [12]. Among bacteria selected for AMP expression, E. coli, particularly strain E. coli BL2l (DE3) has been most popularly used. The choice of E. coli as a suitable host is attributed to its faster growth rate, higher yields, established expression protocols, large commercial availability of expression vectors and cost-effectiveness. Other bacterial systems such as B. subtilis have also been used as hosts for expression of AMPs, but not to the same extent as E. coli. Among yeast, Pichia pastoris has been employed as a potential host. Table 1 shows several AMPs produced recombinantly from engineered microorganisms in the recent years [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. \n\nIt becomes clear that AMPs from numerous and different sources have further been expressed recombinantly. Interestingly, the target AMP in most cases is expressed as a fusion protein (i.e., in combination with a carrier protein) and later cleaved from the same [33]. This is primarily to avoid the toxicity of the AMP to the host strain. Carrier proteins have specific anionic properties, which when fused with an AMP, neutralize the overall cationic charge on the AMP. Thus toxicity of the AMP to the host cells is reduced. Also known as fusion partners, these carrier proteins reportedly also increase the solubility of target AMPs being expressed [33].",

Antimicrobial Peptides (AMP) have garnered interest as a viable solution to this grave issue and are being explored for their potential antimicrobial applications. Given their low bioavailability in nature, tailoring new AMPs or strategizing approaches for increasing the yield of AMPs, therefore, becomes pertinent. The present review focuses on biotechnological interventions directed towards enhanced AMP syn-thesis and revisits existing genetic engineering and synthetic biology strategies for production of AMPs. This review further underscores the importance and potential applications of advanced gene editing technologies for the synthesis of novel AMPs in future.\n## Heterologous Expression of Antimicrobial Peptides\nRecombinant DNA technology has often been considered as the most effective method for enhanced production of proteins, peptides or enzymes. The technology proves to be advantageous not just regarding reduced time and wellestablished protocols, but also reduced production costs and easy scale up. Genes expressing the target protein/peptide of interest are cloned into specific vectors for expression in host cellular expression systems. Bacteria and yeast are the most widely used host systems for the expression of recombinant products [11]. In case of AMPs as well, these two expression hosts have been reported to produce more than 95% of the heterologously expressed AMPs [12]. Among bacteria selected for AMP expression, E. coli, particularly strain E. coli BL2l (DE3) has been most popularly used. The choice of E. coli as a suitable host is attributed to its faster growth rate, higher yields, established expression protocols, large commercial availability of expression vectors and cost-effectiveness. Other bacterial systems such as B. subtilis have also been used as hosts for expression of AMPs, but not to the same extent as E. coli. Among yeast, Pichia pastoris has been employed as a potential host. Table 1 shows several AMPs produced recombinantly from engineered microorganisms in the recent years [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. \n\nIt becomes clear that AMPs from numerous and different sources have further been expressed recombinantly. Interestingly, the target AMP in most cases is expressed as a fusion protein (i.e., in combination with a carrier protein) and later cleaved from the same [33]. This is primarily to avoid the toxicity of the AMP to the host strain. Carrier proteins have specific anionic properties, which when fused with an AMP, neutralize the overall cationic charge on the AMP. Thus toxicity of the AMP to the host cells is reduced. Also known as fusion partners, these carrier proteins reportedly also increase the solubility of target AMPs being expressed [33].",

Within this article, we review genetic and process technological aspects of tunable expression systems in E. coli, providing a roadmap for the industrial exploitation of the reviewed technologies. We attempt to differentiate the term \u201cexpression tuning\u201d from its inflationary use by providing a concise definition and highlight interesting fields of application for this versatile new technology. Dependent on the type of inducer (metabolizable or non-metabolizable), different process strategies are required in order to achieve tuning. To fully profit from the benefits of tunable systems, an independent control of growth rate and expression rate is indispensable.

                    "text": "The relevance of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli for the basic biotechnological research as well as for industrial exploitation is outstanding. E. coli served as the primary model organism within the development of modern biotechnology. As a consequence, researchers today have access to a broad spectrum of genetic tools and cultivation techniques, enabling simple and predictable genetic manipulation and cultivation on inexpensive media to high cell densities. As regards industrial exploitation, E. coli emerged as the primary production workhorse for the biotechnological production of primary and secondary metabolites as well as recombinant proteins. This is reflected by the fact that 29 % of all biopharmaceutical products approved as biopharmaceuticals between 2010 and July 2014 are produced in E. coli (Walsh 2014). \n\nOverall productivity and product quality obtained from E. coli processes is determined by the complex interplay of processing mode and the product to be produced as well as the expression system applied. \n\nThe main challenges of recombinant protein production in E. coli are associated with non-suitable (too high or too low) level of recombinant expression: \n\n1. First, high-level expression and the presence of foreign plasmids drain the hosts' metabolic resources (often referred to as metabolic load or metabolic burden) (Bentley et al. 2009;Bienick et al. 2014;Glick 1995;Mairhofer et al. 2013). Metabolic load often resulting in depletion of amino acids or aminoacyl-tRNAs and triggering heatshock response can therefore ultimately affect product quality-related issues (specific activity, stability, and immunogenicity) and product quantity-related issues (product degradation, lower specific product yields, lower biomass yields, or shorter culture stability). 2. Second, high-level expression of recombinant products can lead to the formation of unfolded or partially folded insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies which show no catalytic function or activity (Baig et al. 2014;Kane and Hartley 1991). 3. Third, the production of many recombinant products, especially proteins containing disulfide bridges, demands translocation between compartments of the E. coli cell factory (Baneyx and Mujacic 2004).",

Sagmeister, C. Herwig\n## Abstract\nTuning of transcription is a powerful process technological tool for efficient recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. Many challenges such as product toxicity, formation of inclusion bodies, cell death, and metabolic burden are associated with non-suitable (too high or too low) levels of recombinant protein expression. Tunable expression systems allow adjusting the recombinant protein expression using process technological means. This enables to exploit the cell\u2019s metabolic capacities to a maximum. Within this article, we review genetic and process technological aspects of tunable expression systems in E. coli, providing a roadmap for the industrial exploitation of the reviewed technologies. We attempt to differentiate the term \u201cexpression tuning\u201d from its inflationary use by providing a concise definition and highlight interesting fields of application for this versatile new technology. Dependent on the type of inducer (metabolizable or non-metabolizable), different process strategies are required in order to achieve tuning. To fully profit from the benefits of tunable systems, an independent control of growth rate and expression rate is indispensable. Being able to tackle problems such as long-term culture stability and constant product quality expression tuning is a promising enabler for continuous processing in biopharmaceutical production.\n## Introduction\nThe relevance of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli for the basic biotechnological research as well as for industrial exploitation is outstanding. E. coli served as the primary model organism within the development of modern biotechnology. As a consequence, researchers today have access to a broad spectrum of genetic tools and cultivation techniques, enabling simple and predictable genetic manipulation and cultivation on inexpensive media to high cell densities. As regards industrial exploitation, E. coli emerged as the primary production workhorse for the biotechnological production of primary and secondary metabolites as well as recombinant proteins. This is reflected by the fact that 29 % of all biopharmaceutical products approved as biopharmaceuticals between 2010 and July 2014 are produced in E. coli (Walsh 2014). \n\nOverall productivity and product quality obtained from E. coli processes is determined by the complex interplay of processing mode and the product to be produced as well as the expression system applied. \n\nThe main challenges of recombinant protein production in E. coli are associated with non-suitable (too high or too low) level of recombinant expression: \n\n1. First, high-level expression and the presence of foreign plasmids drain the hosts' metabolic resources (often referred to as metabolic load or metabolic burden) (Bentley et al. 2009;Bienick et al. 2014;Glick 1995;Mairhofer et al. 2013). Metabolic load often resulting in depletion of amino acids or aminoacyl-tRNAs and triggering heatshock response can therefore ultimately affect product quality-related issues (specific activity, stability, and immunogenicity) and product quantity-related issues (product degradation, lower specific product yields, lower biomass yields, or shorter culture stability). 2. Second, high-level expression of recombinant products can lead to the formation of unfolded or partially folded insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies which show no catalytic function or activity (Baig et al. 2014;Kane and Hartley 1991). 3. Third, the production of many recombinant products, especially proteins containing disulfide bridges, demands translocation between compartments of the E. coli cell factory (Baneyx and Mujacic 2004).",

Chaudhuri\n## Abstract\nBackgroundHuman serum albumin (HSA)\u2014one of the most demanded therapeutic proteins with immense biotechnological applications\u2014is a large multidomain protein containing 17 disulfide bonds. The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction).

Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we have filled in the gap in the literature by exploiting the E. coli host system, which is fast-growing and scalable at the low cost of fermentation, as a microbial factory for the enhancement of functional production of rHSA, a crucial protein for therapeutic and biotechnological applications.\n",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system.

A new era began in the biopharmaceutical industry with the production of insulin, the first recombinant protein, in E. coli and its use in treating diabetes. After insulin, many biopharmaceuticals produced from E. coli have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat various human diseases. Although E. coli has some disadvantages, such as lack of post\u2010translational modifications and toxicity, it is an important host with advantages such as being a well\u2010known bacterium in recombinant protein production, cheap, simple production system, and high yield. This study examined biopharmaceuticals produced and approved in E. coli under the headings of peptides, hormones, enzymes, fusion proteins, antibody fragments, vaccines, and other pharmaceuticals. The topics on which these biopharmaceuticals were approved for treating human diseases, when and by which company they were produced, and their use and development in the field are included.",

The production of some complicated proteins may be limited, for instance, by the incapacity to undertake specific posttranslational modifications and limits protein maturation and disulfide bond formation. 10 It is well-recognized that proper glycosylation and folding are crucial, particularly for complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. 11 Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US FDA have approved several recombinant therapeutic medicines produced from E. coli for several clinical purposes. 12",

A new era began in the biopharmaceutical industry with the production of insulin, the first recombinant protein, in E. coli and its use in treating diabetes. After insulin, many biopharmaceuticals produced from E. coli have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat various human diseases. Although E. coli has some disadvantages, such as lack of post\u2010translational modifications and toxicity, it is an important host with advantages such as being a well\u2010known bacterium in recombinant protein production, cheap, simple production system, and high yield. This study examined biopharmaceuticals produced and approved in E. coli under the headings of peptides, hormones, enzymes, fusion proteins, antibody fragments, vaccines, and other pharmaceuticals. The topics on which these biopharmaceuticals were approved for treating human diseases, when and by which company they were produced, and their use and development in the field are included.\n## INTRODUCTION\nEscherichia coli was discovered to potentially produce recombinant proteins robustly and cost-effectively with the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s. 1 Until then, the pancreas of pigs and cows was the source of the insulin needed to treat diabetes. 2 onetheless, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced by E. coli in the early 1980s, starting the next phase in the treatment of diabetes and providing a pathway for the production of more recombinant pharmaceuticals. 3 This achievement showed that even though insulin is a het-erodimer that needs oxidative protein folding, it can be synthesized in E. coli. 4 Since then, improved recombinant pharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies have started to be produced using a variety of expression hosts, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, and mammalian cells. 5 Compared with other recombinant microorganisms, E. coli remains one of its most attractive hosts. 7][8] A general method for producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals in E. coli is presented in Figure 1. \n\nF I G U R E 1 General method for producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals in Escherichia coli. \n\nE. coli is favored for large-scale manufacturing due to its quick growth, inexpensive nutritional needs, simplicity in scaling up, and capacity to produce high-yield, highquality pharmaceuticals. 9 Nevertheless, the application of E. coli has some restrictions. The production of some complicated proteins may be limited, for instance, by the incapacity to undertake specific posttranslational modifications and limits protein maturation and disulfide bond formation. 10 It is well-recognized that proper glycosylation and folding are crucial, particularly for complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. 11 Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US FDA have approved several recombinant therapeutic medicines produced from E. coli for several clinical purposes. 12",

Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI. These factors play a crucial role in optimizing the production and guaranteeing increased production of the recombinant immunotoxin.",

Pitari, R. Ippoliti\n## Abstract\nThe production of therapeutic recombinant toxins requires careful host cell selection. Bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells are common choices, but no universal solution exists. Achieving the delicate balance in toxin production is crucial due to potential self-intoxication. Recombinant toxins from various sources find applications in antimicrobials, biotechnology, cancer drugs, and vaccines. \u201cToxin-based therapy\u201d targets diseased cells using three strategies. Targeted cancer therapy, like antibody\u2013toxin conjugates, fusion toxins, or \u201csuicide gene therapy\u201d, can selectively eliminate cancer cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed. Notable toxins from various biological sources may be used as full-length toxins, as plant (saporin) or animal (melittin) toxins, or as isolated domains that are typical of bacterial toxins, including Pseudomonas Exotoxin A (PE) and diphtheria toxin (DT). This paper outlines toxin expression methods and system advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing host cell selection\u2019s critical role.\n## Introduction\nThe commercial production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes involves the utilization of various hosts, with the most common choices being bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cell lines. However, identifying the most suitable host cell is arguably the most critical step in the entire production process. There are no universally ideal organisms capable of safely and efficiently producing all types of proteins. Therefore, the selection of an expression system must be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the final product. \n\nEscherichia coli is used for the recombinant production of at least 30% of the therapeutic proteins currently approved and has been-due to its well-known genetics, high rate of growth, and, in many cases, high yields-considered a favored platform in the biotech sector for its expression of proteins. For E. coli systems, there is a plethora of knowledge and extensive tools, such as vectors suitable for expression, selected strains, technologies endowed with fermentation, and strategies suitable for increasing protein folding, that are ideally developed in industrial applications. Recent advances in complex protein expression, such as full-length antibodies in non-glycosylated form, the engineering of new strains, N-glycosylation in bacterial organisms, and finally, cell-free systems, suggest that complex proteins and humanized glycoproteins can be produced in E. coli and that several strains and a lot of expression vectors have been engineered, such as the BL21(DE3)-pLysS for handling toxic proteins. E. coli can grow rapidly and produce high-density cultures using quite inexpensive culture media, allowing, in many cases, for high yields of the protein of interest. \n\nEukaryotic cells can be utilized as an alternative to prokaryotic cells for the expression in those cases requiring the strict control of the folding and assembly of multi-subunit proteins and the correct formation of disulfides since they have the required molecular, genetic, and metabolic characteristics. Because yeast cells are recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms, they are advantageous host organisms for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing of therapeutic recombinant proteins.\n\n## \u2022\nProkaryotic hosts Among the various systems for producing heterologous proteins, E. coli, a Gramnegative bacterium, continues to be one of the most attractive hosts. Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI. These factors play a crucial role in optimizing the production and guaranteeing increased production of the recombinant immunotoxin.",

In particular, for thermostable proteins, there is a need for hosts able to properly synthesize, fold, and excrete these in high yields, and thermophilic Bacillaceae represent one potentially interesting group of microorganisms for such purposes. A number of thermophilic Bacillaceae including B. methanolicus, B. coagulans, B. smithii, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, G. kaustophilus, and G. stearothermophilus are investigated concerning physiology, genomics, genetic tools, and technologies, altogether paving the way for their utilization as hosts for recombinant production of thermostable and other difficult-to-express proteins. Moreover, recent successful deployments of CRISPR/Cas9 in several of these species have accelerated the progress in their metabolic engineering, which should increase their attractiveness for future industrial-scale production of proteins. This review describes the biology of thermophilic Bacillaceae and in particular focuses on genetic tools and methods enabling use of these organisms as hosts for recombinant protein production.",

                    "text": "Bacteria are widely used in science and industry as cell factories for production of recombinant proteins. The choice of bacterial host and expression system relies heavily on the origin and properties of the heterologous protein. Today, the most commonly used bacterial hosts for expression of heterologous proteins are the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. E. coli is in many cases the most used host due to several advantages, including an extensively developed genetic tool box, well-known genetics and physiology, low-cost media, and rapid protein production in a short fermentation period [1]. However, this species also exhibits some limitations as the heterologous proteins are typically expressed intracellularly, which results in problems with formation of inclusion bodies and incorrect protein folding. B. subtilis, on the other hand, has become an industrial workhorse for recombinant protein production due to an easy cultivation, the products of its metabolism being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), ease of genetic manipulation, well-characterized expression systems, absence of significant codon bias, and exceptional ability to secrete heterologous proteins allowing cost-effective downstream processing. Lacking an outer membrane, B. subtilis can efficiently secrete recombinant proteins to the culture medium, therefore this bacterium is more suitable for the production of secretory recombinant proteins than E. coli [2,3]. Challenges in recombinant protein production in B. subtilis have typically been related to the activity of cell-wall-associated proteases interfering with folding of heterologous proteins in the interface between cell wall and extracellular space. This has later been ameliorated with the use of genome editing to remove the genes coding for interfering proteases [4][5][6]. Further work on B. subtilis to improve its properties as a host for heterologous protein production has been done, including Morimoto et al. (2008) demonstrating that a 20% reduction of genome size resulted in a proportionate increase in recombinant protein yields at the cost of lowered growth rates [7].",

Drejer, Sigrid Hakv\u00e5g, Marta Irla, T. Brautaset\n## Abstract\nAlthough Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are the most prominent bacterial hosts for recombinant protein production by far, additional species are being explored as alternatives for production of difficult-to-express proteins. In particular, for thermostable proteins, there is a need for hosts able to properly synthesize, fold, and excrete these in high yields, and thermophilic Bacillaceae represent one potentially interesting group of microorganisms for such purposes. A number of thermophilic Bacillaceae including B. methanolicus, B. coagulans, B. smithii, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, G. kaustophilus, and G. stearothermophilus are investigated concerning physiology, genomics, genetic tools, and technologies, altogether paving the way for their utilization as hosts for recombinant production of thermostable and other difficult-to-express proteins. Moreover, recent successful deployments of CRISPR/Cas9 in several of these species have accelerated the progress in their metabolic engineering, which should increase their attractiveness for future industrial-scale production of proteins. This review describes the biology of thermophilic Bacillaceae and in particular focuses on genetic tools and methods enabling use of these organisms as hosts for recombinant protein production.\n## Introduction\nBacteria are widely used in science and industry as cell factories for production of recombinant proteins. The choice of bacterial host and expression system relies heavily on the origin and properties of the heterologous protein. Today, the most commonly used bacterial hosts for expression of heterologous proteins are the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. E. coli is in many cases the most used host due to several advantages, including an extensively developed genetic tool box, well-known genetics and physiology, low-cost media, and rapid protein production in a short fermentation period [1]. However, this species also exhibits some limitations as the heterologous proteins are typically expressed intracellularly, which results in problems with formation of inclusion bodies and incorrect protein folding. B. subtilis, on the other hand, has become an industrial workhorse for recombinant protein production due to an easy cultivation, the products of its metabolism being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), ease of genetic manipulation, well-characterized expression systems, absence of significant codon bias, and exceptional ability to secrete heterologous proteins allowing cost-effective downstream processing. Lacking an outer membrane, B. subtilis can efficiently secrete recombinant proteins to the culture medium, therefore this bacterium is more suitable for the production of secretory recombinant proteins than E. coli [2,3]. Challenges in recombinant protein production in B. subtilis have typically been related to the activity of cell-wall-associated proteases interfering with folding of heterologous proteins in the interface between cell wall and extracellular space. This has later been ameliorated with the use of genome editing to remove the genes coding for interfering proteases [4][5][6]. Further work on B. subtilis to improve its properties as a host for heterologous protein production has been done, including Morimoto et al. (2008) demonstrating that a 20% reduction of genome size resulted in a proportionate increase in recombinant protein yields at the cost of lowered growth rates [7].",

There are several platforms for production of target recombinant proteins, including bacterial, yeasts, and mammalian expression systems [1,2] . Although the selection of the expression host is dependent on the nature of the target protein, the E. coli expression system is the preferred host for screening and even initial development of commercial recombinant products [3,4] . The advantages of using E. coli as a bacterial expression system include the rapid growth rate to high cell density, inexpensive production substrate, and easy genetic manipulation and transformation [4,5] . The efficiency of the recombinant protein expression in this host is related to the genetic characteristics of the E. coli strain, expression vectors and the target heterologous protein.\n\nIn addition, manipulation of the expression process to optimize protein production is essential to enhance the yield of the protein [6] . The classical method for optimization of a protein expression is to change one factor at a time while keeping other factors constant. This method is often ineffective because changing one factor at a time does not represent the combined effect of the involved variables. In addition, it is a timeconsuming process and needs a large number of experiments [6,7] . To overcome this problem, the best approach is to use the statistical design of experiments, which allows simultaneous evaluation of many more variables at lower cost with a few experimental trials [6][7][8] . In view of this consideration, the goal of this work was to improve the expression of a previously described fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, in E. coli [9] , using experimental design.",

Amiri, N. Zarei, S. Enayati, M. Azizi, V. Khalaj, S. Shahhosseini\n## Abstract\nBackground: Design of experiments is a rapid and cost-effective approach for optimization of recombinant protein production process. In our previous study, we generated a potent dual-acting fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, to target B-cell malignant cell lines. In the present investigation, we report the effect of different variables on the expression levels of this fusion protein. Methods: Four variables (cell optical density at induction, IPTG concentration, induction temperature, and induction time) were tested using experimental design. Results: Our findings demonstrated that among the examined variables, only the induction time had a significant positive effect on the protein expression yield. Conclusion: Experimental design was successfully applied in this study. The optimized condition obtained in the current study can be applied in future commercial production of this novel fusion protein.\n## INTRODUCTION\necombinant pharmaceutical proteins such as antibody fragments offer many advantages over traditional drugs. There are several platforms for production of target recombinant proteins, including bacterial, yeasts, and mammalian expression systems [1,2] . Although the selection of the expression host is dependent on the nature of the target protein, the E. coli expression system is the preferred host for screening and even initial development of commercial recombinant products [3,4] . The advantages of using E. coli as a bacterial expression system include the rapid growth rate to high cell density, inexpensive production substrate, and easy genetic manipulation and transformation [4,5] . The efficiency of the recombinant protein expression in this host is related to the genetic characteristics of the E. coli strain, expression vectors and the target heterologous protein.\n\nIn addition, manipulation of the expression process to optimize protein production is essential to enhance the yield of the protein [6] . The classical method for optimization of a protein expression is to change one factor at a time while keeping other factors constant. This method is often ineffective because changing one factor at a time does not represent the combined effect of the involved variables. In addition, it is a timeconsuming process and needs a large number of experiments [6,7] . To overcome this problem, the best approach is to use the statistical design of experiments, which allows simultaneous evaluation of many more variables at lower cost with a few experimental trials [6][7][8] . In view of this consideration, the goal of this work was to improve the expression of a previously described fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, in E. coli [9] , using experimental design.",

Results revealed that the first generation of engineered strain showed a 50% reduction in the production of the model recombinant protein fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) compared to the reference system from QIAGEN. The over-transcription of glyA was found to be a major factor responsible for the metabolic burden. The second- and third-generation of expression systems presented an increase in FucA production and advantageous features. In particular, the third-generation expression system is antibiotic-free, autotrophy-selection based and single-plasmid and, is capable to produce FucA at similar levels compared to the original commercial expression system.

Generally, cultivation is easy, media are cheap, and a high product titer can be obtained. However, harsh induction procedures using isopropyl \u03b2-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside as inducer are often referred to cause stress reactions, leading to a phenomenon known as \u201cmetabolic\u201d or \u201cproduct burden\u201d. These high expressions of recombinant proteins mainly result in decreased growth rates and cell lysis at elevated induction times. Therefore, approaches tend to use \u201csoft\u201d or \u201ctunable\u201d induction with lactose and reduce the stress level of the production host. The usage of glucose as energy source in combination with lactose as induction reagent causes catabolite repression effects on lactose uptake kinetics and as a consequence reduced product titer. Glycerol\u2014as an alternative carbon source\u2014is already known to have positive impact on product formation when coupled with glucose and lactose in auto-induction systems, and has been referred to show no signs of repression when cultivated with lactose concomitantly. In recent research activities, the impact of different products on the lactose uptake using glucose as carbon source was highlighted, and a mechanistic model for glucose-lactose induction systems showed correlations between specific substrate uptake rate for glucose or glycerol (qs,C) and the maximum specific lactose uptake rate (qs,lac,max). In this study, we investigated the mechanistic of glycerol uptake when using the inducer lactose. We were able to show that a product-producing strain has significantly higher inducer uptake rates when being compared to a non-producer strain. Additionally, it was shown that glycerol has beneficial effects on viability of cells and on productivity of the recombinant protein compared to glucose.",

                    "text": "The Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the expression host of choice for the production of 30% to 40% of recombinant drugs in industry [1,2]. As E. coli shows very fast replication rates [3,4] on comparatively cheap media [5], the benefits often outweigh the numerous purification steps [1,6] and the missing glycosylation pattern [1,7,8]. Recombinant protein production in E. coli gained more interest again as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments increased, which can be properly expressed in E. coli [1,8]. The strain BL21(DE3), created by F. Studier and B. Moffatt back in 1986 [9], is often used in an industrial scale because of very low acetate formation, high replication rates as an effect of the integrated T7-polymerase [9][10][11][12][13][14], as well as the possibility of protein secretion into the fermentation broth due to a type 2 secretion protein [15][16][17]. As the lac operon is still one of the most favored promotors in pET-expression systems [3,12,18], it is generally used for insertion of the gene of interest. The repressor protein can only be blocked by allolactose or a structural analogue [19], e.g., the well-known inducer isopropyl \u03b2-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [3,13]. However, induction with IPTG stresses the cells, as IPTG in higher concentrations is referred to be toxic at elevated induction times [13,18,20]. As tunable protein production is commonly applied in industry nowadays, mixed-feed systems using either IPTG [21] or lactose [13,22,23] as inducer did result in higher product yields when compared to other inducer supplies [24]. Soft induction performed with lactose shows promising results [13,23,25]. As lactose can be metabolized in E. coli, it does not stress the cells as much as IPTG [26].",

Kopp, C. Slouka, Sophia Ulonska, J. Kager, J. Fricke, O. Spadiut, C. Herwig\n## Abstract\nThe Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the host of choice for a multitude of used recombinant proteins. Generally, cultivation is easy, media are cheap, and a high product titer can be obtained. However, harsh induction procedures using isopropyl \u03b2-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside as inducer are often referred to cause stress reactions, leading to a phenomenon known as \u201cmetabolic\u201d or \u201cproduct burden\u201d. These high expressions of recombinant proteins mainly result in decreased growth rates and cell lysis at elevated induction times. Therefore, approaches tend to use \u201csoft\u201d or \u201ctunable\u201d induction with lactose and reduce the stress level of the production host. The usage of glucose as energy source in combination with lactose as induction reagent causes catabolite repression effects on lactose uptake kinetics and as a consequence reduced product titer. Glycerol\u2014as an alternative carbon source\u2014is already known to have positive impact on product formation when coupled with glucose and lactose in auto-induction systems, and has been referred to show no signs of repression when cultivated with lactose concomitantly. In recent research activities, the impact of different products on the lactose uptake using glucose as carbon source was highlighted, and a mechanistic model for glucose-lactose induction systems showed correlations between specific substrate uptake rate for glucose or glycerol (qs,C) and the maximum specific lactose uptake rate (qs,lac,max). In this study, we investigated the mechanistic of glycerol uptake when using the inducer lactose. We were able to show that a product-producing strain has significantly higher inducer uptake rates when being compared to a non-producer strain. Additionally, it was shown that glycerol has beneficial effects on viability of cells and on productivity of the recombinant protein compared to glucose.\n## Introduction\nThe Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the expression host of choice for the production of 30% to 40% of recombinant drugs in industry [1,2]. As E. coli shows very fast replication rates [3,4] on comparatively cheap media [5], the benefits often outweigh the numerous purification steps [1,6] and the missing glycosylation pattern [1,7,8]. Recombinant protein production in E. coli gained more interest again as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments increased, which can be properly expressed in E. coli [1,8]. The strain BL21(DE3), created by F. Studier and B. Moffatt back in 1986 [9], is often used in an industrial scale because of very low acetate formation, high replication rates as an effect of the integrated T7-polymerase [9][10][11][12][13][14], as well as the possibility of protein secretion into the fermentation broth due to a type 2 secretion protein [15][16][17]. As the lac operon is still one of the most favored promotors in pET-expression systems [3,12,18], it is generally used for insertion of the gene of interest. The repressor protein can only be blocked by allolactose or a structural analogue [19], e.g., the well-known inducer isopropyl \u03b2-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [3,13]. However, induction with IPTG stresses the cells, as IPTG in higher concentrations is referred to be toxic at elevated induction times [13,18,20]. As tunable protein production is commonly applied in industry nowadays, mixed-feed systems using either IPTG [21] or lactose [13,22,23] as inducer did result in higher product yields when compared to other inducer supplies [24]. Soft induction performed with lactose shows promising results [13,23,25]. As lactose can be metabolized in E. coli, it does not stress the cells as much as IPTG [26].",

These proteins are produced in the eukaryotic or prokaryotic heterologous hosts. By increasing the omics data especially related to different heterologous hosts as well as the presence of new amenable genetic engineering tools, we can artificially engineer heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities. Numerous recombinant proteins have been produced and applied in various industries, and the global recombinant proteins market size is expected to be cast to reach USD 2.4 billion by 2027. Therefore, identifying the weakness and strengths of heterologous hosts is critical to optimize the large-scale biosynthesis of recombinant proteins. E. coli is one of the popular hosts to produce recombinant proteins. Scientists reported some bottlenecks in this host, and due to the increasing demand for the production of recombinant proteins, there is an urgent need to improve this host. In this review, we first provide general information about the E. coli host and compare it with other hosts. In the next step, we describe the factors involved in the expression of the recombinant proteins in E. coli . Successful expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli requires a complete elucidation of these factors. Here, the characteristics of each factor will be fully described, and this information can help to improve the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli .",

Recombinant proteins are used in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, agriculture, etc. Nowadays, there is a great demand for the production of recombinant proteins to prevent, diagnose and treat human diseases. Overall, to express a recombinant protein, a DNA molecule containing the open reading frame of a particular protein is identified, isolated, cloned into a vector, and finally expressed in a suitable host. A heterologous gene can be expressed in different types of heterologous hosts, therefore, choosing a suitable host is a critical step. Mammalian cells, bacteria, yeasts, plants, and insects are hosts that have been introduced for heterologous expression of a gene or genes of interest. The bacterial host is the most used expression system due to its simple expression method and low cost. E. coli strains are the most utilized bacterial host for the expression of recombinant proteins. Known and unknown factors are involved in enhancing the expression of recombinant protein in E.coli. These known factors include the selection of suitable expression vectors, the choosing of the adjustable promoter, the picking up of the competent strain of E. coli, codon optimization, concentration of the inducer in the induction time, induction period, the translocation of heterologous proteins into the periplasm or extracellular space, application of proper affinity tags, types and condition of the culture medium, etc. Moreover, E.coli as a heterologous host has strengths and weaknesses. Identification of every aspect of E. coli can be a useful strategy to boost its efficiency in recombinant protein production. Here, we discussed the important elements that are involved in heterologous gene expression in E. coli. One of these elements is the IBs formation. Over-expression of recombinant proteins in E.coli is very likely to form IBs. These bodies are resistant to proteases and harvesting them from lysed cells can be done through moderate-speed centrifugation as well as in the case of proteins that are toxic to the host, IBs are the best solution to overcome this challenge.",

Also, the bacteria-based expression system is the second most profitable after mammalian cells (Karyolaimos et al. 2019) Easy manipulation of the genome of unicellular hosts such as bacteria is their main advantage over multicellular organisms. In addition, unlike multicellular organisms, the transformation of bacteria is simple, highly efficient, and cost-effective (Baneyx 1999). In general, the cost of production, the complexity of the work path, the different patterns of post-translation modifications, the high protease property of hosts, the inability to secrete recombinant proteins, the contamination with pathogens and toxins, the solubility of recombinant proteins, and the unrelated codon preference can be a major bottleneck in the expression of recombinant proteins in various sorts of hosts (Bock 2015). To improve recombinant protein expression in the E. coli system we can apply some strategies such as using different promoters to regulate the over-expression of genes, utilizing different strains of E. coli, reducing the growth temperature, secretion of protein to extracellular space, changing the culture medium, using tags, and simultaneous expression of recombinant proteins with chaperones or foldases to help the correct folding of the proteins (Baeshen et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2007).",

These proteins are produced in the eukaryotic or prokaryotic heterologous hosts. By increasing the omics data especially related to different heterologous hosts as well as the presence of new amenable genetic engineering tools, we can artificially engineer heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities. Numerous recombinant proteins have been produced and applied in various industries, and the global recombinant proteins market size is expected to be cast to reach USD 2.4 billion by 2027. Therefore, identifying the weakness and strengths of heterologous hosts is critical to optimize the large-scale biosynthesis of recombinant proteins. E. coli is one of the popular hosts to produce recombinant proteins. Scientists reported some bottlenecks in this host, and due to the increasing demand for the production of recombinant proteins, there is an urgent need to improve this host. In this review, we first provide general information about the E. coli host and compare it with other hosts. In the next step, we describe the factors involved in the expression of the recombinant proteins in E. coli . Successful expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli requires a complete elucidation of these factors. Here, the characteristics of each factor will be fully described, and this information can help to improve the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli .\n## Fig. 1\nComparison of heterologous hosts by income: In total, revenue from recombinant proteins which are produced in all heterologous hosts is very considerable as in 2020 and 2021 this amount is 358.4 and 556.6 million dollars, respectively. Also, the bacteria-based expression system is the second most profitable after mammalian cells (Karyolaimos et al. 2019) Easy manipulation of the genome of unicellular hosts such as bacteria is their main advantage over multicellular organisms. In addition, unlike multicellular organisms, the transformation of bacteria is simple, highly efficient, and cost-effective (Baneyx 1999). In general, the cost of production, the complexity of the work path, the different patterns of post-translation modifications, the high protease property of hosts, the inability to secrete recombinant proteins, the contamination with pathogens and toxins, the solubility of recombinant proteins, and the unrelated codon preference can be a major bottleneck in the expression of recombinant proteins in various sorts of hosts (Bock 2015). To improve recombinant protein expression in the E. coli system we can apply some strategies such as using different promoters to regulate the over-expression of genes, utilizing different strains of E. coli, reducing the growth temperature, secretion of protein to extracellular space, changing the culture medium, using tags, and simultaneous expression of recombinant proteins with chaperones or foldases to help the correct folding of the proteins (Baeshen et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2007).\n\n## Conclusion and future perspective\nThe production of various sorts of proteins with different applications in heterologous hosts has been one of the most important achievements of biotechnology and genetic engineering in recent years. Recombinant proteins are used in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, agriculture, etc. Nowadays, there is a great demand for the production of recombinant proteins to prevent, diagnose and treat human diseases. Overall, to express a recombinant protein, a DNA molecule containing the open reading frame of a particular protein is identified, isolated, cloned into a vector, and finally expressed in a suitable host. A heterologous gene can be expressed in different types of heterologous hosts, therefore, choosing a suitable host is a critical step. Mammalian cells, bacteria, yeasts, plants, and insects are hosts that have been introduced for heterologous expression of a gene or genes of interest. The bacterial host is the most used expression system due to its simple expression method and low cost. E. coli strains are the most utilized bacterial host for the expression of recombinant proteins. Known and unknown factors are involved in enhancing the expression of recombinant protein in E.coli. These known factors include the selection of suitable expression vectors, the choosing of the adjustable promoter, the picking up of the competent strain of E. coli, codon optimization, concentration of the inducer in the induction time, induction period, the translocation of heterologous proteins into the periplasm or extracellular space, application of proper affinity tags, types and condition of the culture medium, etc. Moreover, E.coli as a heterologous host has strengths and weaknesses. Identification of every aspect of E. coli can be a useful strategy to boost its efficiency in recombinant protein production. Here, we discussed the important elements that are involved in heterologous gene expression in E. coli. One of these elements is the IBs formation. Over-expression of recombinant proteins in E.coli is very likely to form IBs. These bodies are resistant to proteases and harvesting them from lysed cells can be done through moderate-speed centrifugation as well as in the case of proteins that are toxic to the host, IBs are the best solution to overcome this challenge.",

Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

Recently, new techniques aim to shift the control of protein production from humans to cells and empower the latter to regulate the production process, thus leading to increased protein quality. Herein we provide a perspective on the way integrative synthetic biology can be applied to traditional biotechnological applications with potentially transformative results.\n\nFrom early on, the production of recombinant proteins in microbial cells has revolutionized our ability to produce industrial and medical products in vast quantities. Human insulin, human growth hormone (HGH), \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 interferons are some examples of the mass-produced products in the multi-billion dollar recombinant protein production industry. Several organisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, plants, insect and mammalian cells, currently serve as production systems for heterologous proteins. Escherichia coli is arguably one of the most widely used hosts for recombinant protein production since it can achieve high yields, it is fast and inexpensive to grow and it can be easily modified. Remarkably, E. coli can accumulate up to 80% of its",

However, bacterial cloning is not an easy task. We aimed to clone, express, and purify recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 and overcome problems in favor of commercial purposes. Materials and Methods: To amplify the gene product for cloning, we primarily designed two specific primers for the target gene. Following PCR amplification, the amplicon was inserted into the pET-21b[+) vector. The E. coli BL21 [DE3) CodonPlus strain was chosen for the expression of the target gene. Finally, the expressed recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 was assessed through the western blotting method. Results: We performed a cloning process and produced recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 in an optimal condition. We also noticed that monomeric protein could be transformed to a homodimeric structure which can be observed using the SDS PAGE [SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and western blotting. Conclusion: Experimental conditions strongly affect the large-scale cloning procedures required to be optimized in each laboratory. The expressed recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 described here is appropriate for commercial purposes.",

                    "text": "With the advent of genetic engineering technologies, many proteins have been experimentally expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with high efficiency. Because of its short life cycle, easy genetic manipulation, and simple culture conditions, E. coli is a preferable host to produce many recombinant proteins [5,6]. E. coli was the first host utilized by Eli Lilly in 1982 to produce recombinant insulin [7]. Although all bacteria could be used for recombinant protein technologies, E. coli is still the preferable host for the industrial production of recombinant proteins [8]. For cloning purposes in E. coli species, researchers are faced with two main obstacles: solubility of recombinant proteins for high expression and low and complicated expression of a foreign gene. Accordingly, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus strain is a good host for large-scale protein expression. The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

Moghadam, M. Mousavi, M. Sankian\n## Abstract\nBackground: Interferon-gamma [IFN-\u03b3) is the most important cytokine in the immune system. This protein has been expressed in bacterial cells. However, bacterial cloning is not an easy task. We aimed to clone, express, and purify recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 and overcome problems in favor of commercial purposes. Materials and Methods: To amplify the gene product for cloning, we primarily designed two specific primers for the target gene. Following PCR amplification, the amplicon was inserted into the pET-21b[+) vector. The E. coli BL21 [DE3) CodonPlus strain was chosen for the expression of the target gene. Finally, the expressed recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 was assessed through the western blotting method. Results: We performed a cloning process and produced recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 in an optimal condition. We also noticed that monomeric protein could be transformed to a homodimeric structure which can be observed using the SDS PAGE [SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and western blotting. Conclusion: Experimental conditions strongly affect the large-scale cloning procedures required to be optimized in each laboratory. The expressed recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 described here is appropriate for commercial purposes.\n## I\nWith the advent of genetic engineering technologies, many proteins have been experimentally expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with high efficiency. Because of its short life cycle, easy genetic manipulation, and simple culture conditions, E. coli is a preferable host to produce many recombinant proteins [5,6]. E. coli was the first host utilized by Eli Lilly in 1982 to produce recombinant insulin [7]. Although all bacteria could be used for recombinant protein technologies, E. coli is still the preferable host for the industrial production of recombinant proteins [8]. For cloning purposes in E. coli species, researchers are faced with two main obstacles: solubility of recombinant proteins for high expression and low and complicated expression of a foreign gene. Accordingly, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus strain is a good host for large-scale protein expression. The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

The generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different expression systems. The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells. This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to express.",

Bartolo-Aguilar, C. Ch\u00e1vez-Cabrera, L. Flores-Cotera, J. Badillo-Corona, Carmen Oliver-Salvador, R. Marsch\n## Abstract\nLow-temperature expression of recombinant proteins may be advantageous to support their proper folding and preserve bioactivity. The generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different expression systems. The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells. This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to express.\n## Background\nWith the development of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, the expression and production of recombinant proteins in various host organisms became feasible, easier, and more cost-effective than proteins derived from natural sources.

This paper outlines the recent improvements in upstream and downstream unit operations for producing Fab fragments in E. coli. Monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab) are a rising class of biotherapeutics and their production has been optimised using coexpression of molecular chaperones such as DsbC or DnaK\u2013DnaJ\u2013GrpE, as well as strain engineering for post-translational modifications such as disulphide bridging. Different media systems such as EnBase and combining nitrogen source supplementation with low-temperature cultivation have resulted in improvement in cell integrity, protein expression, and protein refolding. The recovery of native proteins from insoluble inclusion bodies can be improved by adjusting refolding conditions, as well as by incorporating multimodal and affinity chromatography for achieving high product yields in purification.

Patil, Anupa Anupa, J. A. Gupta, A. Rathore\n## Abstract\nMicrobial host systems remain the most efficient and cost-effective chassis for biotherapeutics production. Escherichia coli is often the preferred host due to ease of cloning, scale-up, high product yields, and most importantly, cost-effective cultivation. E. coli often experience difficulties in producing biologically active therapeutics such as Fab fragments, which require protein folding and subsequent three-dimensional structure development. This paper outlines the recent improvements in upstream and downstream unit operations for producing Fab fragments in E. coli. Monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab) are a rising class of biotherapeutics and their production has been optimised using coexpression of molecular chaperones such as DsbC or DnaK\u2013DnaJ\u2013GrpE, as well as strain engineering for post-translational modifications such as disulphide bridging. Different media systems such as EnBase and combining nitrogen source supplementation with low-temperature cultivation have resulted in improvement in cell integrity, protein expression, and protein refolding. The recovery of native proteins from insoluble inclusion bodies can be improved by adjusting refolding conditions, as well as by incorporating multimodal and affinity chromatography for achieving high product yields in purification. Recent developments summarised in this review may tune the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the near future.\n",

            "text": "Since its FDA approval in 1985, hGH has been used for clinical applications for more than three decades [15]. A variety of expression hosts has been used for production of hGH including mammalian, yeast and bacterial cells [16][17][18]. The use of E. coli as an expression host has several advantages including the possibility of easy manipulation of bacteria, low growth cost, rapid cell growth and the possibility of culturing high-density cells, which together make it an ideal system, especially from economic view compared to other expression systems [19]. \n\nDuring the cytoplasmic expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli, a single methionine is necessarily added to its N-terminal region. This may not be a problem for industrial enzymes, but in the case of recombinant proteins with pharmaceutical use, in addition to causing unwanted side effects, it is shown that it may stimulate the immune system and produce antibodies against these proteins [31]. Although this methionine can be removed using enzymatic reactions, its removal might impose some problems and additional costs on the system for their mass production, which is not desirable [20]. \n\nA major solution to overcome this problem in E. coli is the secretion of recombinant proteins into the culture medium using a suitable secretory signal peptide. Extracellular production of recombinant proteins has many advantages. The release of the recombinant proteins into the culture medium, in addition to reducing costs in the industry, eliminates the need to disrupt the host cell to extract and purify the proteins. As a result, proteases as well as endotoxins are not released into the environment. In addition, by continuously producing target proteins in the host, more recombinant proteins can be obtained in the fermenter. Although there are advantages to expressing proteins as periplasmic or cytoplasmic, each has disadvantages that limit the use of these methods, such as creating insoluble forms as inclusion body in the cytoplasm or obtaining small amounts of protein in the periplasmic method due to the limited capacity of the periplasm in the E. coli.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been the pioneering host for recombinant protein production, since the original recombinant DNA procedures were developed using its genetic material and infecting bacteriophages. As a consequence, and because of the accumulated know-how on E. coli genetics and physiology and the increasing number of tools for genetic engineering adapted to this bacterium, E. coli is the preferred host when attempting the production of a new protein. Also, it is still the first choice for protein production at laboratory and industrial scales for an important number of proteins, being fast growth and simple culture procedures critical issues. When searching for an ideal system for protein production, this bacterial species is clearly far from offering, in generic terms, optimal conditions for protein production and downstream. Plasmid loss and antibiotic-based maintenance, undesired chemical inducers of gene expression, plasmid/ protein-mediated metabolic burden and stress responses, lack of post-translational modifications (including the inability to form disulphide bonds), none or poor secretion, protein aggregation and proteolytic digestion, endotoxin contamination and complex downstream are among the main obstacles encountered during protein production in E. coli. In the pharmaceutical scenario, proper protein glycosylation is often requested and simplest purification procedures become highly desirable when pursuing cost-effective bioproduction. In this context, the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisae, diverse mammalian cell lines, insect cells and whole plant and animals (as transgenic systems) are being incorporated to the protein production scenario [1], and many of these products have been already approved for use as protein drugs [2]. Other (less conventional) yeast species and a more limited number of species of filamentous fungi [3], molds [4], moss [5], algae [6] and protozoa [7] are also under development as potential suppliers of recombinant proteins. The engineering of such systems could represent a promising way to the cost effective production of high quality protein versions that biotechnology and biomedical industries are steadily demanding. The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9]",

Also, the bacteria-based expression system is the second most profitable after mammalian cells (Karyolaimos et al. 2019) Easy manipulation of the genome of unicellular hosts such as bacteria is their main advantage over multicellular organisms. In addition, unlike multicellular organisms, the transformation of bacteria is simple, highly efficient, and cost-effective (Baneyx 1999). In general, the cost of production, the complexity of the work path, the different patterns of post-translation modifications, the high protease property of hosts, the inability to secrete recombinant proteins, the contamination with pathogens and toxins, the solubility of recombinant proteins, and the unrelated codon preference can be a major bottleneck in the expression of recombinant proteins in various sorts of hosts (Bock 2015). To improve recombinant protein expression in the E. coli system we can apply some strategies such as using different promoters to regulate the over-expression of genes, utilizing different strains of E. coli, reducing the growth temperature, secretion of protein to extracellular space, changing the culture medium, using tags, and simultaneous expression of recombinant proteins with chaperones or foldases to help the correct folding of the proteins (Baeshen et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2007).",

Therefore, the selection of an expression system must be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the final product. \n\nEscherichia coli is used for the recombinant production of at least 30% of the therapeutic proteins currently approved and has been-due to its well-known genetics, high rate of growth, and, in many cases, high yields-considered a favored platform in the biotech sector for its expression of proteins.

Recent advances in complex protein expression, such as full-length antibodies in non-glycosylated form, the engineering of new strains, N-glycosylation in bacterial organisms, and finally, cell-free systems, suggest that complex proteins and humanized glycoproteins can be produced in E. coli and that several strains and a lot of expression vectors have been engineered, such as the BL21(DE3)-pLysS for handling toxic proteins.

Aside from having been used by humans for millennia for the production of bread and alcoholic beverages, yeasts are now used as cell factories for the production of biofuels, biocontrol agents, probiotics, flavouring agents and a host of high-value products [13] (Figure 1).",

            "text": "The selection of host cells for industrial application has some technical difficulties despite the availability of many gene manipulations theoretically in various organisms. The availability of a genetic map, gene exchange system, useful vector and transformation procedures, and metabolic pathways leading from raw material to the desired product are essential criteria for selecting a suitable host strain. The most popular organisms used to date for the expression of the recombinant proteins are E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Streptomyces spp, Corynebacterium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha and various animal/plant cells. E. coli remains an important host system for the industrial protein production from cloned genes as one of the main applications of genetic engineering in biotechnology. Various efficient expression vector systems have been developed, and a variety of mutants are available as host strains for different purposes [92,93]. Overexpression of a heterologous protein is possible in E. coli, making it suitable for industrial production. Fermentation DOE is an essential tool for basic research that greatly facilitates efficient purification and analysis of such proteins [94]. \n\nFor the successful production of the recombinant protein-based vaccine, producing biologically active protein is an essential requirement that can be further scaled up. Production of a biologically active recombinant protein depends on the host cell's microenvironment for expression and compatibility of codon usage. E. coli has been a widely used expression host for the high-level production of heterologous protein. Differences in usage of codons in prokaryotes (E. coli) and eukaryotes Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) can substantially impact heterologous protein production. The compatibility of codon usage can significantly increase protein expression [95,96]. Moreover, the presence of rare codons in cloned genes affects protein expression level and mRNA & plasmid stability. The excessive presence of rare codons may result in ribosome stalling, slow translation errors [96,97]. In some cases, rare codons inhibit protein synthesis and cell growth [98].",

These drawbacks include lack of suitable secretion systems and limited post translational modifications (PTMs; e.g., glycosylation is not trivial in bacterial systems).

Over the years, a high level of heterologous protein was made possible in a variety of hosts ranging from the bacteria Escherichia coli to mammalian cells. Recombinant protein importance is represented by its market size, which reached $1654 million in 2016 and is expected to reach $2850.5 million by 2022. Among the available hosts, yeasts have been used for producing a great variety of proteins applied to chemicals, fuels, food, and pharmaceuticals, being one of the most used hosts for recombinant production nowadays. Historically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the dominant yeast host for heterologous protein production. Lately, other yeasts such as Komagataella sp., Kluyveromyces lactis, and Yarrowia lipolytica have emerged as advantageous hosts. In this review, a comparative analysis is done listing the advantages and disadvantages of using each host regarding the availability of genetic tools, strategies for cultivation in bioreactors, and the main techniques utilized for protein purification. Finally, examples of each host will be discussed regarding the total amount of protein recovered and its bioactivity due to correct folding and glycosylation patterns.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are complex exogenous (\"foreign\") proteins that are produced in expression hosts, and mainly used as medical diagnostic reagents and in human healthcare as vaccines, drugs, or monoclonal antibodies [1]. The prominent role and increasing market demand for high-value recombinant proteins in novel drug discovery creates an opportunity for the development of various protein expression hosts to manufacture proteins by following the existing rigid standards laid down for veterinary and human applications. The industry is focusing mainly on already established production platforms using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as Escherichia coli, a selection of yeast, insect, and mammalian cell cultures, due to their well-defined processes in-line with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) [2]. Moreover, industrially established mammalian and other cell cultures have stringent regulatory approval in place, which hinders the industrial acceptance of the new technology or production system. Bacterial expression systems offer rapid production with high product yield, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (yeast) offer post-translational modifications (PTMs) which are essential for functional activity of the recombinant proteins [3]. The majority of the approved recombinant biopharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cell lines [4]. However, all the production systems have their own merits and setbacks such as production time, high operating costs, protein yield, chances of contamination with pathogenic microorganisms, limited post-translational modifications, and regulatory approval. In order to compete with the established platform, the new expression system must have unique advantages that can overcome the limitations of the existing ones. Plants offer several potential benefits over conventional expression platforms and prove the reliability of the system for the production of highly valuable proteins. Advancements in plant molecular farming approaches in the recent decade have made plants an attractive manufacturing system that can even achieve commercially relevant production levels in a short period [1,5,6]. As the progress is continuously being made in this ever-growing field, here in this review, we summarize the importance and prospects of plant expression systems for the cost-effective production of recombinant proteins. Potential vaccine candidates, monoclonal antibodies, and industrial enzymes expressed in plants are also described.",

The production of recombinant proteins has been implemented in many different prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, Arabidopsis, and even in mammalian cell culture lines (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Among these systems, E. coli is often preferred due to its fast growth, high cell density cultures, rich complex media, and easy transformation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to improve the heterologous protein expression of E. coli systems, a number of protein tags have been developed, including the maltose-binding protein (MBP; Kapust and Waugh, 1999), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Smith and Johnson, 1988), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO; Marblestone et al., 2006), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA; Davis et al., 1999), thioredoxin (Trx;LaVallie et al., 1993), and ubiquitin (Bachmair et al., 1986;Varshavsky, 2005).",

            "text": "Bacteria are widely used in science and industry as cell factories for production of recombinant proteins. The choice of bacterial host and expression system relies heavily on the origin and properties of the heterologous protein. Today, the most commonly used bacterial hosts for expression of heterologous proteins are the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. E. coli is in many cases the most used host due to several advantages, including an extensively developed genetic tool box, well-known genetics and physiology, low-cost media, and rapid protein production in a short fermentation period [1]. However, this species also exhibits some limitations as the heterologous proteins are typically expressed intracellularly, which results in problems with formation of inclusion bodies and incorrect protein folding. B. subtilis, on the other hand, has become an industrial workhorse for recombinant protein production due to an easy cultivation, the products of its metabolism being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), ease of genetic manipulation, well-characterized expression systems, absence of significant codon bias, and exceptional ability to secrete heterologous proteins allowing cost-effective downstream processing. Lacking an outer membrane, B. subtilis can efficiently secrete recombinant proteins to the culture medium, therefore this bacterium is more suitable for the production of secretory recombinant proteins than E. coli [2,3]. Challenges in recombinant protein production in B. subtilis have typically been related to the activity of cell-wall-associated proteases interfering with folding of heterologous proteins in the interface between cell wall and extracellular space. This has later been ameliorated with the use of genome editing to remove the genes coding for interfering proteases [4][5][6]. Further work on B. subtilis to improve its properties as a host for heterologous protein production has been done, including Morimoto et al. (2008) demonstrating that a 20% reduction of genome size resulted in a proportionate increase in recombinant protein yields at the cost of lowered growth rates [7].",

They are frequently used in industrial production of biofuels and chemicals [1] . However, the extraction and purification of valuable proteins from natural sources pose a challenge because of their low yields, making them unsuitable for industrial processes [2] . The use of recombinant proteins for disease treatment has become a well-established option, with therapeutic biopharmaceuticals being one of the fastest-growing multibillion-dollar industries. The vaccination industry generated approximately US $28 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach US $39 billion by 2022 [3] . Enzyme usage in various industrial sectors has grown continuously, particularly over the past two decades. These sectors include dairy product manufacturing [4] , starch transformation [5] , baking [6] , and beverage production [7] . For industrial production, microbial organisms are widely used to express recombinant proteins of medical or industrial value [8] . Bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli , are the most efficient producers because of their rapid growth and simple culture conditions. However, they cannot complete the post-transcriptional processes required for eukaryotic proteins, such as protein folding, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and removal of signal peptides [9] . In contrast, mammalian cells such as CHO cells have an effective post-translational modification process for eukaryotic proteins [10] . Nevertheless, the cost of recombinant protein production using mammalian cells is high due to their slow growth rate and complex culture conditions, limiting their application in this field [11] . In comparison, yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris offer sevhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.engmic.2023.100122 eral advantages.

            "text": "Many efforts have been made to produce recombinant proteins on a large industrial scale. Heterologous protein expression in the platform host by the introduction of the gene of interest is the most promising approach in several aspects. Heterologous expression hosts can overcome the complexities associated with native hosts, such as slow and fastidious growth, limited molecular biology tools, scarce genetic information, and low productivity (Park et al., 2020). Several representative heterologous expression hosts have been used according to their specialized characteristics and product types (Huo et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Kang and Kim, 2021;Pham et al., 2021). For example, Escherichia coli is the most extensively studied and used for heterologous protein expression, as it exhibits rapid growth, ease of genetic manipulation, and high productivity. Bacillus subtilis is another extensively used Gram-positive bacteria that acts as an efficient workhorse for the production of industrial enzymes and pharmaceuticals, having robust growth and good genetic tractability, along with many endogenous proteases. Beyond the microbial hosts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a commonly used eukaryotic host for recombinant protein production due to its recombinant DNA stability, easy genome engineering strategies, and the ability to provide post-translational modifications. Recently, a high-throughput platform for heterologous protein expression for fungal biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in S. cerevisiae, named HEx, was established to successfully produce diverse fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) (Harvey et al., 2018). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the mammalian cell line that dominates the other recombinant protein production hosts because of their capacity to express large and complex recombinant proteins, but genetic engineering and clonal selection are more difficult than microbial hosts. \n\nAmong the potential microbial chassis, the genus Streptomyces, a soil-derived Gram-positive bacterium with a high GC content genome, is an attractive microbial host for heterologous protein expression (Liu et al., 2018a).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of therapeutic proteins (191,254). In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of process, design, and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems have been examined in detail in an excellent review by Marino (362). In addition, Datar et al. (121) have analyzed the economic issues associated with protein production in bacterial and mammalian cells. \n\nThe many advantages of Escherichia coli have ensured that it remains a valuable organism for the high-level production of recombinant proteins (177a, 197, 254, 362, 406, 426, 510). However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

Great efforts have been made in the last decade, particularly in Brazil, to make the industrial production of 2G ethanol via enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane biomass economically feasible [14][15][16]. \n\nE. coli is the most common host for the recombinant expression of cellulases and is one of the most common bacteria used to produce recombinant proteins in general [17][18][19][20]. The main advantages of using E. coli are well known, such as the ability of E. coli to grow rapidly on simple and inexpensive media, the ability of this bacteria to grow to high cell densities and achieve high levels of protein expression, the availability of strains with low proteolytic activities, and the large body of scientific knowledge concerning the physiology, genetics, and manipulation of E. coli [18,[21][22][23][24]. However, E. coli also presents disadvantages with respect to recombinant protein production: normally, the protein is not secreted by the cell, which often makes downstream processing more complex and expensive; the recombinant protein may aggregate and form insoluble particles called inclusion bodies, in which the protein is inactive; disulfide bonds may not form as intended, leading to protein denaturation and often to the formation of inclusion bodies; the cell machinery may stall or truncate proteins owing to codon bias, leading to low expression or loss of function; E. coli is not capable of performing post-translational modifications such as glycosylation; and the lipopolysaccharides that constitute the outer membrane of E. coli elicit strong immune responses in humans and other mammals [17][18][19][20][21].",

Despite the relative ease of use of E. coli for achieving the high expression of many recombinant proteins, for some proteins, e.g., membrane proteins or proteins of eukaryotic origin, this approach can be rather ineffective. Another microorganism long-used and popular as an expression system is baker\u2019s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In spite of a number of obvious advantages of these yeasts as host cells, there are some limitations on their use as expression systems, for example, inefficient secretion, misfolding, hyperglycosylation, and aberrant proteolytic processing of proteins. Over the past decade, nontraditional yeast species have been adapted to the role of alternative hosts for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., Komagataella phaffii, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These yeast species\u2019 several physiological characteristics (that are different from those of S. cerevisiae), such as faster growth on cheap carbon sources and higher secretion capacity, make them practical alternative hosts for biotechnological purposes. Currently, the K. phaffii-based expression system is one of the most popular for the production of heterologous proteins. Along with the low secretion of endogenous proteins, K. phaffii efficiently produces and secretes heterologous proteins in high yields, thereby reducing the cost of purifying the latter. This review will discuss practical approaches and technological solutions for the efficient expression of recombinant proteins in K. phaffii, mainly based on the example of enzymes used for the feed industry.",

Accordingly, where the product is a simpler protein, E. coli is often the ideal choice of production host. Indeed, the first recombinant therapeutic protein (human insulin) has been commercially produced in E. coli since 1982 (Baeshen et al., 2014). Many other commercial recombinant protein products including cytokines for cancer treatment or technical enzymes for industrial applications have been produced in E. coli, but its status as the gold standard prokaryotic host is mainly for historical reasons and a range of other prokaryotes may be more suitable (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2016). In our laboratory, we use Pseudomonas fluorescens for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, which accumulate in the cytosol by default or can be secreted to the culture medium (Retallack et al., 2012). For example, we chose cytosolic accumulation for the production of a 19-kDa phenylalanine-free protein that can be used for the dietetic management of patients suffering from phenylketonuria -an inborn error metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Hoffmann et al., 2018). The phenylalanine-free protein can easily be extracted from the cells by high-pressure homogenization and isolated via a single affinity purification step (Figure 1). Simple medium-scale cultivation in 2.5-L shake flasks with a culture volume of 0.5-1.0 L achieved yields of 2.5 g/L.",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

            "text": "The least expensive, simplest, and fastest protein expression can be achieved in Escherichia coli. Nonetheless, large proteins are difficult to be synthesized with this bacterium. Moreover, E. coli is not the best system for S-S-rich proteins that require post-translational modifications. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most frequently used yeast species for the production of such proteins. At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11]. System efficiency can be improved by maintaining conditions that stabilize intermediate folding and promote mature structure formation. Various strategies can help prevent the aggregation of proteins by masking the hydrophobic patches on their external surfaces [12,13]. Such strategies involve the introduction of chaperone molecules, incorporation of detergents, or co-expression of interacting sub-units involved in large complexes. When the conditions are designed to maintain the mono-dispersion of the folding intermediates, speeding up the folding cycle becomes essential for the production of stable native structures and prevention of the accumulation of metastable configurations that are potentially vulnerable to aggregation [14]. Foldases and isomerases may improve the folding process considerably. In this review, we focus on the solutions that are available for improving the bacterial expression of proteins that rely on the formation of disulfide bonds in their native state.",

Presently, approximately 90% of industrial enzymes are recombinant versions produced in bacteria and fungi [5], and their use is expected to increase due to a growing need for sustainable solutions. Moreover, the discovery of new enzymes to add to the currently available toolbox and the development of optimized strategies for the production of these hydrolytic enzymes is a central goal of many industrial sectors [6]. \n\nThere is a wide spectrum of hosts used as expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins that include bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect and mammalian cells and whole transgenic plants and animals [7]. Although the use of each host has different advantages and disadvantages, their main objective is process optimisation [7]. The most commonly used host to produce recombinant proteins is E. coli owing to its easy and rapid growth. However, the use of E. coli does present several drawbacks which can be overcome by the use of other types of host. Gram-positive hosts, such as Streptomyces, are an excellent alternative due to high secretion efficiency, which makes their use feasible for the direct release of proteins of interest into the culture medium. This in turn facilitates downstream procedures, such as extraction and purification, and consequently decreases the costs associated with the production of recombinant proteins. In addition, some Streptomyces strains have a relatively low level of endogenous extracellular proteolytic activity in comparison with other hosts [8,9]. Also, Streptomyces has proved useful to produce high levels of different proteins [8][9][10][11][12]. \n\nThe use of enzymes produced by microorganisms as biocatalysts in industry can be considered \"green chemistry\" because no toxic waste is generated [6]. Nevertheless, many of the plasmids used for recombinant production of enzymes are based on the use of antibiotic resistance genes as selection markers.",

            "text": "The methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris, is a useful system for the production of genetically engineered enzymes (through heterologous gene expression) for both research and industrial purposes [18]. It is considered non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, White Oak, MD, USA) has approved several products prepared with help of this organism, and these products are generally accepted as safe substances (GRAS). In addition, it is an excellent host for the synthesis of recombinant proteins and offers additional benefits ranging from rapid growth to high cell density in an inexpensive and non-complex culture medium and facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins expressed heterologically [19][20][21]. \n\nE. coli expression systems are often used to produce exogenous protein on laboratory and industrial scales owing to the low cost, speed, and simplicity of cultivation [22]. E. coli strains DH5\u03b1 and Rosetta (DE3) have been used for the cloning of genes and the expression of proteins. E. coli is one of the earliest and most commonly used hosts for heterologous protein production [23,24]. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields [25][26][27]. It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism [28]. Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins [29][30][31][32]. Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted. This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control.",

However, since it lacks fundamental prerequisites for efficient secretion, recombinant proteins manufactured by E. coli systems are mainly produced as inclusion bodies. 125,131 Moreover, posttranscriptional modifications are not achieved with this system. There are many examples of proteins for gene delivery produced in E. coli with probed efficiency. 132,133 Like E. coli, yeasts can be grown cheaply and rapidly and are amenable to high-cell-density fermentations. Besides possessing complex posttranslational modification pathways, they offer the advantage of being neither pyrogenic nor pathogenic and are able to secrete more efficiently. Species established in industrial production procedures are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, and Hansenulapolymorpha. S. cerevisiae is the best genetically characterized eukaryotic organism among them all and is still the prevalent yeast species in pharmaceutical production processes. 131 In spite of their physiological advantageous properties and natively high expression and secretion capacity, the employability of yeasts in some cases, however, might reach a limit, particularly when the pharmacological activity of the product is impaired by the glycosylation pattern. In such cases, either a postsynthetic chemical modification has to be considered or the employment of more highly developed organisms. Most examples of nanoparticles produced in yeast are for VLPs. 134 Animal cell expression systems show the highest similarity to human cells regarding the pattern and capacity of posttranslational modifications and the codon bias. However, their culture is more complicated and costlier and usually yields lower product titers. Among the known systems, insect cells infected by baculovirus vectors have reached popularity since they are considered to be more stress-resistant, easier to handle, and more productive compared with mammalian systems and are thus frequently employed for high-throughput protein expression. For commercial application, scale-up related questions have to be solved. [135][136][137] Preferably applied",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a preferred expression host due to its well-known biochemistry and genetics, as well as simple and straightforward genetic manipulations. Some disadvantages of this prokaryotic expression system include a lack of posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins (i.e., glycosylation, formation of disulfide bonds, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing), formation of insoluble inclusion bodies, poor secretion, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Thus, the E. coli expression system is constantly being improved to overcome these problems [1,3,16]. Recombinant proteins have also been produced in other bacterial cell factories, e.g., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Streptomyces spp., allowing the efficient secretion of recombinant proteins or lactic acid bacteria with the Generally Recognized as Safe status by FDA, such as Lactobacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis [1,4,17]. \n\nEukaryotic cells possess an endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which play a substantial role in posttranslational modifications and transport of proteins, and thus are widely used in the production of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals. Among all first-time approved biopharmaceuticals from 2015 to July 2018, over half (53%) were monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and, consequently, mammalian cells dominated the other eukaryotic expression systems [18]. Mammalian cells, including the most commonly used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), have the ability to produce large and complex proteins with appropriate posttranslational modifications, especially glycosylation, with mediumto-high yields. However, the mammalian cell factories have some limitations, namely, the introduction of heterologous gene and selection of the clone being time-consuming, the risk of infection by viruses being high, the scale-up capacity being low, the propagation being difficult, the production time being long, and the ultimate overall costs being high [1,3].",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, proteins have become very important substances in many industrial, medical and research fields. The protein products range from industrial and diagnostic enzymes to protein-based drugs and vaccines. One of the main obstacles is the production of the desired protein products in sufficient amounts [1]. Recombinant production of proteins is often used to produce large amounts of proteins needed for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. One of the most widely used hosts for protein expression is the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, due to its rapid multiplication, inexpensive nutritional requirements, fast and easy transformation, and high-level expression of the recombinant protein. However, the frequent misfolding and aggregation of recombinant proteins is one of the main disadvantages of this expression host [2]. Moreover, this expression system cannot be used for the production of proteins requiring posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), which are crucial for the correct folding and activity of eukaryotic proteins. \n\nGlycosylation is one of the key properties of recombinant proteins with pharmaceutical or medical application-glycoprotein drugs have been used against autoimmune disorders, cancers, and invasive diseases caused by pathological microorganisms. It has been reported that N-glycosylation and N-glycan structures can affect biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic proteins [3]. Moreover, proteins with incorrect glycosylation can cause immunological responses in a target organism. The majority of pharmaceutical proteins are therefore produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which perform human-like glycosylation. However, protein production in CHO is very expensive and requires complex growth media, which are often contaminated with animal viruses during the production of recombinant proteins [4]. \n\nOne of the most popular alternative hosts for the production of glycosylated proteins is the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. It offers low-cost cultivation in minimal media, which can be easily upscaled to a large scale. Proteins are correctly folded and glycosylated in a pattern similar to mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one among the earliest and most commonly used host organism for protein expression (Terpe, 2006) due to the fast growth and expression, ease of culture and high yields (Swartz, 1996). Moreover, the genetics of E. coli are wellunderstood when compared to other organisms. Despite its great advantages, E. coli has certain drawbacks that can possibly influence the production efficiency of recombinant proteins. This is because a high cell density of this organism results in large quantities of acetate, which is toxic to cells. It is also reported through studies that this organism fails to produce very large proteins. Additionally, some issues were observed for E. coli system in terms of difficulties in producing proteins that have disulfide bonds and refolding ability. Another factor is the failure to produce modified protein due to the absence of glycosylation (Jenkins and Curling, 1994). Glycosylation affects properties such as solubility, stability functionality, immunogenicity, etc. In order to achieve glycosylation for attaining a stable and properly folded protein, a higher advantage is noticed for recombinant production in yeast, mold, insect or mammalian cells. A solution can be opting for secretion of the heterologous protein into the medium instead of intracellular inclusion bodies. This way, soluble and active proteins can be attained with a much easier downstream processing and cost reduction (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005). Emergence of other bacterial systems can also be noticed over the years in the field of recombinant protein production. The engineering of Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium for membrane protein expression is one such example (Chen, 2012). Additionally, they also possess advantages over E. coli in terms of being GRAS and endotoxin free (Yeh et al., 2009). Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, were also found as suitable alternatives to E. coli expression systems to attain higher yields of the recombinant protein. Today, several other bacterial systems are widely explored as cell factories.",

            "text": "Research in the past few decades has revolutionized the use of therapeutically valuable proteins in a variety of clinical treatments. Because most genes can be expressed in many different systems, it is essential to determine which system offers the most advantages for the production of the recombinant protein. The ideal expression system would be the one that produces the most safe, biologically active material at the lowest cost. The use of modified mammalian cells with recombinant DNA techniques has the advantage of resulting in products that are identical to those of natural origin; however, culturing these cells is expensive and can only be carried out on a limited scale. The use of microorganisms such as bacteria permits manufacture on a larger scale, but introduces the disadvantage of producing products that differ appreciably from the products of natural origin. For example, proteins that are usually glycosylated in humans are not glycosylated by bacteria. Furthermore, human proteins that are expressed at high levels in E. coli frequently acquire an unnatural conformation accompanied by intracellular precipitation, owing to lack of proper folding and disulfide bridges. \n\nThe production of recombinant proteins in plants has many potential advantages for generating biopharmaceuticals relevant to clinical medicine. First, plant systems are more economical than industrial facilities using fermentation or bioreactor systems. Second, the technology is already available for harvesting and processing plants and plant products on a large scale. Third, the purification requirement can be eliminated when the plant tissue containing the recombinant protein is used as a food (edible vaccines). Fourth, plants can be directed to target proteins into intracellular compartments in which they are more stable, or even to express them directly in certain compartments (chloroplasts). Fifth, the amount of recombinant product that can be produced approaches industrial-scale levels. Last, health risks arising from contamination with potential human pathogens or toxins are minimized.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression has revolutionized all aspects of the biological sciences. Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006). As the number of recombinantly produced proteins increases, so too does an appreciation for the difficulties and limitations inherent to this process.\n\nIn spite of the development of multiple nonbacterial recombinant expression systems over the last three decades (yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cell, cell free systems; see Table 5.24.1), Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for recombinant protein expression (Yin et al., 2007). The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale.\n\nDespite its many advantages and widespread use, there are also disadvantages to using E. coli as an expression host. In contrast to eukaryotic systems, transcription and translation are fast and tightly coupled. Since many eukaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool  Spirin, 2004;Langlais et al., 2007; for other references, see text.\n\nof partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded,",

            "title": "Enhanced extracellular production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli by co-expression with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C",
            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely studied and frequently used host for recombinant protein production because its genetics are well-characterized, the culture periods are short, and protein production levels are high [1][2][3]. Because E. coli has both inner and outer membranes, recombinant proteins produced in this host can localize to the cytoplasm, the periplasm, or the culture medium [2,4]. Production of recombinant proteins in the culture medium is the most desirable of these alternatives, whether the protein is produced on an analytical or industrial scale, because the protein being produced experiences superior protein folding, requires a simpler extraction procedure, and is contaminated with fewer proteins [1,5]. Unfortunately, E. coli is a relatively poor secretor of proteins, which is a significant barrier to the application to this methodology [6]. \n\nMany attempts have been made to enhance the extracellular production of recombinant secretory proteins in E. coli, and some success has been achieved [2,6]. Two different approaches have been pursued. In one approach, protein secretion was enhanced through co-expression or modification of transport proteins [7][8][9][10]. The validity and universality of this approach may be compromised by the complexity and regulatory mechanisms associated with protein secretion systems. The other approach was to enhance nonspecific leakage of the recombinant proteins through the host cell membranes by constructing hosts with a leaky phenotype. Induction of the leaky phenotype can be accomplished through mutation or deletion of membrane components, addition of permeability enhancers (glycine, calcium, Triton X-100, etc.), or co-expression of proteins with lytic activity (bacterial phage lysis proteins) [2,[11][12][13][14]. Because the cell membrane is compromised to some extent, this approach has the inherent risks of impaired cell growth and cell lysis. Cytosolic proteins are generally expressed in the cytoplasm and extracted, after cell disruption, using physical, chemical, or biological methods. These processes result in contamination of the recombinant protein by various cellular components.",

The transient gene expression approach is commonly used to shortly produce large amounts of protein for the biochemical studies of the drug and to perform preclinical investigations [17,18]. Expi 293 cell is a HEK293 cell-derived class for culture in high cell density suspension and serum-free culture medium. The chemically defined form of these properties makes this cell suitable for industrial production [19]. \n\nThe mammalian cell expression system is currently the most common method of producing this antibody; however, Escherichia coli has the potential to produce proteins without a glycosylation pattern, as well as the ease of ordering the production process and the cost-effectiveness of the bacterial culture raw materials has made this host a suitable host for the production of Fc-free antibodies and dualspecific antibodies [20]. Accordingly, a significant portion of therapeutic proteins without glycosylation pattern is produced in this host, and BL21 (DE3) is among the most common industrial and research strains. The long history of industrial use of E. coli, as well as the appropriate rules of the drug production supervisory departments to this host, are significant advantages of this production platform [21]. \n\nConsidering the single-chain and non-glycosylation of Blinatombe, the capacity of the bacterial expression system to produce this antibody was used; we compared it with the antibody produced in eukaryotic cells. This is because no such comparison has been made for the Blinatomb antibody. The great advantages of E. coli, as a suitable host include its industrial production parameters; the availability of inexpensive culture media for the production of biopharmaceuticals in this host; the expression of monoclonal antibodies of two BiTE family traits (due to no post-translational changes). The commercial manufacturer expressed Blinatomomb in the host of CHO. This study aimed to examine the expression and binding properties of antibodies expressed in both systems and compare them.",

            "text": "Proteins are complex molecules and therefore synthesis by cell free system is difficult. One of the alternative ways is to produce protein in heterologous host. Recombinant DNA technology has opened the door to a new world of biotechnological products for the production of heterologous proteins in microorganisms, like, for instance, pharmaceutical products and industrial enzymes. It is now possible to produce large quantities of proteins in industrial scale at low price and with constant high quality by means of recombinant DNA technology. In 1982, the first product of recombinant DNA technology was produced by Lilly [1], namely insulin, a life saving drug for diabetic patients. Since then many proteins and enzymes have been produced worldwide for food and medical purposes. In most cases, recombinant genes are expressed in heterologous host. The most commonly used and well studied organism for the heterologous expression of proteins is E. coli. However, a variety of alternative hosts have been developed as the nature of the recombinant proteins being expressed became more complex. \n\nIn this context, yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae are very useful hosts because they have several advantages over other microorganisms such as: rapid growth, nonpathogenic, discrete cells, ability for replica plating, an accommodating DNA transformation system [2], well defined genetics, cheap and commercially available mutants. Moreover, many human genes related to disease have orthologs in yeast [3], meaning that the same genes have been conserved through time in species, maintaining the same or similar function. Many scientific studies show that nearly 50% of human genes implicated in heritable diseases have yeast homologs [4] or at least 31% of proteins encoded by yeast genes have human homologs. Moreover, cell cycle mechanisms, signal transduction, and metabolic and regulatory mechanisms between yeast and other eukaryotic organisms are conserved. The close homology to higher order eukaryotes and simplicity of yeast genetics allows the introduction of mammalian genes into yeast and the analysis of their function [5].",

These systems are readily available, safe and provide the possibility of changing the amino acid sequence of proteins in order to better adapt the final product to its function in the body. Choosing the right expression system (host and vector) is the key step in the production of biopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe features that support the use of microorganisms for the production of recombinant proteins are their diversity, metabolic potential and the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions [12]. Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level. Bacteria are ideal for the production of low molecular weight proteins that do not require post-translational modifications [37].\n\nBacteria of the species E. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]. Currently, the K-12 E. coli strain and its derivatives [49,75] are routinely used in production. Despite the use of E. coli strains as the system of choice, these microorganisms are",

            "text": "After the whole-genome sequences of thousands of organisms have been well documented, overexpressing genes to get highly pure proteins for further characterization and engineering becomes an indispensable part of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

In 2010, it was reported that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli, compared with those expressed in all hosts had remained constant, at roughly 60% per year during the 15 year period 1995-2009 (S\u00f8rensen, 2010). Table 1 includes the corresponding data for the other commonly used host cells; it shows that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli has remained high to date and that approximately half of these genes are eukaryotic. For all other hosts, the absolute numbers are much smaller, but it is notable that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in Pichia pastoris has steadily increased from 1995 to date, in contrast to all other host cells (Table 1). Coupled with the beginnings of a decline in usage for E. coli over the last 8 years, this could suggest that researchers are beginning to recognize the capacity of P. pastoris to produce more challenging recombinant targets. \n\nEscherichia coli stands out as the pre-eminent host cell for producing recombinant proteins in both commercial [50% of proteins; (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Mattanovich et al., 2012)] and research (>70% of proteins; Table 1) laboratories; it is quick and inexpensive to culture, making it ideal in many respects. However, it has been established that producing eukaryotic proteins  14) 4% ( 5) 4% (5)",

A variety of expression hosts has been used for production of hGH including mammalian, yeast and bacterial cells [18][19][20]. The use of E. coli as an expression host has several advantages including the possibility of easy manipulation of bacteria, low growth cost, rapid cell growth and the possibility of culturing high-density cells, which together make it an ideal system, especially from economic view compared to other expression systems [21].

However, it can be mentioned with certainty that E. coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of pharmaceutical recombinant proteins on an industrial scale. This system is the good choice for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. The advantages of this system include fast growth, high cell density using simple and low cost growth medium, known genetic information, availability of a large number of expression vectors and availability of mutant host strains, simple transfer, easy control, possibility of mass production of recombinant proteins and thus cost-effectiveness. In the case of yeast and mammalian hosts, in most cases, protein production is much lower and more expensive than E. coli host is.",

            "text": "Cost. Recombinant proteins may be expressed in bacteria, fungi and yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, animals, or plants. The cost of the resulting product, especially downstream processing or purification cost has been described as the following. (1) The generation of recombinant proteins in bacterial system is faster and easier and thus allows for the easy progression to large-scale manufacturing [129]. Currently, the most widely used recombinant protein production systems are bacterial systems. However, the limitation of the presence of endogenously produced endotoxins and pathogens in E. coli is difficult and, therefore, costly to remove from target preparations and creates additional complexities [1]. (2) Foreign proteins production in yeasts and fungi offers the cost effectiveness and scaleup benefits of E. coli combined with the advantages of eukaryotic expression. Moreover, protein is expressed into the culture supernatant allowing faster and easier purification; as well, the purified protein contains less contaminating endotoxins as compared to the bacterially expressed counterparts [129]. However, they have a number of technical issues, such as the loss of plasmid and dramatic decrease in protein yield during large-scale production, which should be needed to resolve [1]. (3) Though insect cells have a number of advantages, several disadvantages exist. It has been shown that internal cleavage, at arginine-or lysine-rich sequences, is extremely inefficient and leads to improperly processed proteins. Furthermore, glycosylation capability is limited to only high mannosetype [1]. (4) There are currently many established mammalian cell lines for the production of proteins. It should be noted, however, that the development of large-scale expression techniques is time consuming and requires high initial financial investment. Also, this system requires a nutrient media that is more complex than that of bacteria, fungi, or plants. So, the cost of the resulting product is quite substantial [1,142]. ( 5) Transgenic technology has allowed for recombinant protein production in living animals such as rabbits, goats, pigs, and cows.",

            "text": "Proteins are essential cellular components and play many roles in cell physiology, such as scaffolding cell structures, catalysis, signaling, transport and gene expression regulation. Investigating and assessing these roles often requires a deep understanding of protein structure and activity which demands sufficient quantities of the purified protein, which in many cases needs to be produced heterologously (Bill, 2014). Apart from fundamental research, recombinant protein production also represents a multi-billion dollar market , due to the use of proteins as biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes, e.g. anti-TNF and cancer antibodies, insulin analogs and proteases among others, constituting about 50-60% of the total market (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Huang et al., 2014).\n\nEscherichia coli is predominantly used as host for commercial production and research (Mattanovich et al., 2012), mainly because it is easy to cultivate and manipulate, due to the large number of molecular tools and genetic information available and, more importantly, due to the fact that the recombinant protein fraction in this organism can reach up to 50% of the dry biomass (Porro et al., 2011). There are, however, important drawbacks of using E. coli as a production platform for proteins, for example increased downstream processing costs due to the formation of inclusion bodies (Sorensen, 2010) and lack of correct posttranslational modifications of eukaryal proteins (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). As an alternative, yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are being increasingly used as the preferred platform for protein production. Yeasts have all the advantages of a microbial system (easy of manipulation and cultivation) and possess eukaryal posttranslational machinery (Bill, 2014). Furthermore, the recombinant proteins can be secreted to the extracellular medium, thus facilitating subsequent purification (Nielsen, 2013).\n\nHowever, one of the limitations of using yeast as a production platform is the burden that secreting proteins at higher rates may represent for cell metabolism, especially for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), since protein folding is a very crucial step of the secretory pathway: a correct folding determines if the newly synthesized",

Organisms used as hosts for silk protein fabrication can be different and the most commonly used hosts, as shown in Figure 2, are bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeasts like Pichia pastoris, and mammalian cells like hamster kidney cells, but insect cells can also be used, like Spodoptera frugiperda. E. coli proved to be the most suitable host due to a high density of cells that grow fast and can be easily transformed. Biotechnological manipulation and production allow the modification and improvement of silk characteristics [70]. \n\nSignificant progress has been made in recombinant spider silk production, but further improvements are necessary to overcome the main challenges of high investments and small product yields [67]. Additionally, the commercial use of recombinant spider silk has been limited due to the inability to produce spidroins at their natural size. For example, transgenic mammals and insects have the potential to produce larger proteins, which are easier to purify. However, growing such organisms is costly, and the yields are typically low. On the other hand, E. coli is relatively affordable to cultivate, but it is not efficient in expressing larger spidroins [71]. \n\nIt is a common misunderstanding that the choice of host organism for producing recombinant spider silk only depends on the intended application. Advancements in bioinformatics have facilitated a more thorough examination of the distinct repetitive segments that significantly impact the structure, properties, and function of spidroin. These insights can enhance the efficiency of current host platforms and stimulate the development of novel production techniques to cater to specific production requirements [71]. \n\nProducing spider silk proteins using bacteria is a challenging task due to the high molecular weight of the proteins and their long repetitive regions, containing high levels of glycine and alanine. However, recent studies using E. coli have tried to overcome this issue by using alternative methods that involve the intein system to assemble protein subunits. This has led to the creation of chimeric fibers with impressive mechanical properties [72,73].",

            "text": "The first steps for recombinant protein expression have been made back in 1973, where Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer invented the possibility of in vitro DNAcloning (Cohen et al. 1973, Baeshen et al. 2014). This opened the door for the expression of multiple diverse molecules. The first recombinant pharmaceutical product was insulin, licenced back in 1982 (Baeshen et al. 2014).\n\nToday, the main focus of the pharmaceutical market remains on the production of monoclonal antibodies, diverse hormones and growth factors, which turn out to be the majority of the pharmaceutical income (Walsh 2004, Baeshen et al. 2014, Baeshen et al. 2015.\n\nAlthough complex recombinant proteins are mainly produced in mammalian cells, a good number of proteins is still expressed in Escherichia coli (Walsh 2014, Humer et al. 2018. Recently published papers reported that the production of biopharmaceutical proteins in E. coli moved up to a number as high as 40 % (Walsh 2010, Gupta andShukla 2016). Protein production in E. coli gained importance as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments, which can be successfully expressed in E. coli, increased (Spadiut et al. 2013). E. coli is most likely the cheapest organism to cultivate, though its products are hard to purify and therefore take long durations and efforts when it comes to product purification (Berlec and Strukelj 2013). The genome of E. coli is known very well (Huang et al. 2012) and E. coli shows very fast replication rates, resulting in high cell densities (Murarka et al. 2007, Sahdev et al. 2007. Also, cultivations can be carried out on comparatively cheap media, coupled with the little risk of contamination compared to other cultivation hosts (DeLisa et al. 1999). In addition, scale-up can be straightforward, when compared to other organisms. Summing up, protein production using E. coli as a host provides a very useful alternative to mammalian cell cultivations (Baeshen et al. 2015), as e.g. yields up to 4 g/L of soluble antibody fragments have been reported already (Gupta and Shukla 2016).\n\nBesides the classical aim to produce a high",

At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11].

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) is an industrially important tool for the production of hundreds of licensed recombinant proteins (RPs), including IgG antibodies and antibody fragments (Walsh 2014;Sanchez-Garcia et al. 2016). Unlike their larger full-length IgG monoclonal antibody counterparts, which are commonly produced in mammalian cells, the relative simplicity of antibody fragments and their requirement for fewer post-translational modifications makes them suitable for production in bacterial hosts. The bacterium Escherichia coli is a commonly employed host for recombinant protein production (RPP) contributing to the production of one-third of FDA approved human biotherapeutics (Overton 2014;Walsh 2014). Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are an emerging class of IgG fragments comprising the antigen-binding variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) domains fused into a single polypeptide chain with a flexible linker (Nelson 2010). \n\nThe suitability of E. coli as a host for production of recombinant antibody fragments and other human biotherapeutic proteins stems, in large part from the following: (i) its physiology, metabolism and behaviour are very well understood compared to other bacterial species; (ii) it exhibits much faster growth, attains higher cell densities and also requires much cheaper growth media than mammalian hosts; and (iii) although it cannot produce RPs with 'human-like' glycosylation, it can generate disulphide bonds (Pl\u00fcckthun and Skerra 1989;Hsu et al. 2016). \n\nUnlike the cytoplasm, which is a reducing environment, the periplasm is an oxidising environment and so favours the formation of disulphide bonds (de Marco 2009); it also contains enzymes which catalyse the formation, correction and maintenance of disulphide bonds (the Dsb enzymes (Inaba 2009). The periplasm of E. coli offers additional advantages as a cellular compartment for targeting RPs in bioprocesses.",

            "text": "The non-glycosylated and single-chain polypeptide features of HSA make it less complex than the other bloodextracted proteins like plasminogen activator and clotting factors [3,5]. These features have encouraged several investigators to produce HSA by using recombinant DNA technology and exploiting different host systems including microbial hosts, insect systems, transgenic animals and transgenic plants. Unfortunate-ly, none of the mentioned hosts have been successfully adopted for commercial production of rHSA due to their respective limitations. Transgenic animals [6,7] and plants [8,9] when exploited, required high capital, time consumption and yield was too low; exploiting mammalian expression systems is expensive resulting in very low yields. Consequently, several recombinant hosts such as different yeast strains like Saccharomyces cerevisiae [10,11], Pichia pastoris [12,13] etc. and insect systems [14], have been used for the industrial preparation of rHSA. These also have been associated with several problems including incorrect processing, poor export, hyper-glycosylation and improper folding. Moreover, it requires intense and complicated downstream processing protocols which make it impossible to produce rHSA in a cost-effective manner. \n\nOf all the host systems, E. coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals [15]. E. coli is a genetically and physiologically well-characterized organism which grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. The fermentation batch turnaround number for E. coli culture is 300 per year, which is far greater than any of the host systems available [16]. Therefore, E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts available. \n\nSurprisingly, one of the production methods had remained less explored i.e. rHSA production using E. coli as a host. Despite all the mentioned advantages, E. coli has not been successfully adopted as a host for rHSA production.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression is a foundational tool for molecular cell biology as well as for numerous biotechnologies, such as metabolic engineering and recombinant protein production (therapeutic proteins, vaccines, industrial enzymes, etc.). However, the focus of recombinant protein production is to achieve high titers, yields, and productivities in order to reduce the cost of protein production, because although recombinant protein production is now a well-established practice, large-scale production of proteins, particularly for low-cost applications, still remains economically challenging [1]. \n\nRecombinant protein production begins with the integration of recombinant DNA, often from a heterologous source, into the genome of the host organism under the control of protein expression elements. A DNA vector composed of various genetic elements such as the gene of interest, promoters, terminators, reporters, markers, and enhancers is transformed into the host cell using a variety of different transformation methods. Integration into the host cell genome can also be achieved using a variety of mechanisms such as CRISPR-mediated genome editing or random integration, and is largely influenced by the host cell type (bacterial, plant, yeast, cell culture systems) and species. The most used platforms include bacteria (Escherichia coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), mammalian cells (CHO and HEK-293 cells), and baculovirus/insect cells (Sf9, Sf21) [2]. However, proteins with complex post-translational modifications cannot be produced in the highly productive, low-cost bacteria or yeast systems, and therefore, costly cell culture systems are typically employed. Due to their costs, cell cultures systems are typically only used to produce high-value products like biologics. Thus, there remains a gap in the available production systems for the production eukaryotic proteins for low-cost applications like industrial enzymes. \n\nMicroalgae are microorganisms widely distributed throughout natural environments. Due to the low cost of their cultivation (low energy inputs and simple inorganic media), they have garnered interest as a low-cost platform to produce recombinant proteins.",

Products of these industries, in turn, augment the fields of medicine, diagnostics, food, nutrition, detergents, textiles, leather, paper, pulp and plastics. 1 Enzymes are synthesized by all living organisms as part of their natural metabolism, serving as biocatalysts to increase the rate of the metabolic reactions. The enzyme production rate, yield, quality and functionality are the most important factors to be considered when industrial recombinant enzymes are produced in hosts. 2 The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant enzymes depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, post-translational modifications and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of the therapeutic proteins. 3 Moreover, the cost breakdown in terms of process and design and other economic considerations is required for the selection of a particular expression system. 4 Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, Bacilli (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) and lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus lactis), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris). [5][6][7][8][9] Bacterial expression systems remain very attractive due to their ability to grow rapidly and at high density on inexpensive substrates, their well-characterized genetics and the availability of an increasingly large number of cloning vectors and mutant host strains. 10 The advent of recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized strategies for protein production. Due to the well-characterized genome and a variety of mature tools available for genetic manipulation, E. coli is still the most common workhorse for recombinant protein production. 1,10,11 However, despite the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be efficiently expressed in this organism.\n\nDue to the multiplicity of physiological impacts arising from high-level gene expression and host strains, the overproduction goal can hardly be achieved, and therefore, the yield of rec",

Recombinant proteins are expressed in various hosts, such as bacteria (Swartz, 2001;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009), yeast (Mattanovich et al., 2012;Kim et al., 2015), mammalian cells (Hacker and Balasubramanian, 2016;O'Flaherty et al., 2020), and plants (Mason and Arntzen, 1995;Cramer et al., 2000;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Shanmugaraj and Phoolcharoen, 2021). Each expression system has its own advantages, disadvantages, and certain limitations, such as the availability of resources, inability to undergo molecular modifications, and requirement of sophisticated tools and techniques, resulting in toxic by-products and contamination risks (Barrera and Mayfield, 2013;Corchero et al., 2013). In the last decade, plants have emerged as an alternate platform for the expression of various functional recombinant proteins that have high therapeutic uses, with decreased manufacturing costs that are still in the pipeline for commercialization due to certain concerns related to environmental contamination, allergic reactions, and slow growth cycles (Salazar-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2015). Recombinant protein scale-ups in a safer way have drawn major attention to meet the current demand, with a focus on achieving higher quality and yields at mitigated production costs, thereby ensuring global coverage (Shanmugaraj and Phoolcharoen, 2021). \n\nMicroalgae comprise a diverse group of organisms with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic nature, making them an archetypal platform for recombinant technology.",

            "text": "S everely stressed, with their resources depleted, and their cellular machinery working beyond capacity, the host cells that are used for heterologous protein production have no option but to activate their stress response pathways in order to mitigate the accumulating effects of expressing a foreign, possibly toxic, protein at vast quantities. The result is lower protein yield and quality, with many products being misfolded or part of inclusion bodies that need further processing. Recently, new techniques aim to shift the control of protein production from humans to cells and empower the latter to regulate the production process, thus leading to increased protein quality. Herein we provide a perspective on the way integrative synthetic biology can be applied to traditional biotechnological applications with potentially transformative results.\n\nFrom early on, the production of recombinant proteins in microbial cells has revolutionized our ability to produce industrial and medical products in vast quantities. Human insulin, human growth hormone (HGH), \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 interferons are some examples of the mass-produced products in the multi-billion dollar recombinant protein production industry. Several organisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, plants, insect and mammalian cells, currently serve as production systems for heterologous proteins. Escherichia coli is arguably one of the most widely used hosts for recombinant protein production since it can achieve high yields, it is fast and inexpensive to grow and it can be easily modified. Remarkably, E. coli can accumulate up to 80% of its",

            "text": "However, the mammalian cell factories have some limitations, namely, the introduction of heterologous gene and selection of the clone being time-consuming, the risk of infection by viruses being high, the scale-up capacity being low, the propagation being difficult, the production time being long, and the ultimate overall costs being high [1,3]. \n\nFor these reasons, yeasts are valuable eukaryotic hosts for the production of recombinant proteins for medical and industrial purposes. Yeasts combine advantages of prokaryotic and higher eukaryotic expression hosts, such as simple genetic manipulations, fast growth, low nutritional demands, scalable cultivation, good protein folding and secretion, and the ability to provide posttranslational modifications. In addition, yeasts provide high biomass concentrations, high product yields, and safe pathogen-free production, with medium overall costs [1,3]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was first implemented as a host for recombinant protein production in 1981 [19]. It is still widely used in the production of biopharmaceuticals due to its GRAS status [18], although it has some disadvantages, e.g., fermentative metabolism, plasmid instability, quite low protein yield, and hypermannosylation of recombinant glycoproteins, which makes them highly immunogenic for humans [6,7]. These limitations have resulted in the development of alternative yeast expression systems, including Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) [6,7,20] Ogataea polymorpha (Hansenula polymorpha) [7,21], Kluyveromyces lactis [22], Yarrowia lipolytica [6,7,23], and Blastobotrys adeninivorans (Arxula adeninivorans) [24,25]. Methylotrophic yeast K. phaffii is currently considered to be one of the most effective and versatile platforms for the production of recombinant proteins, including biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes [6,26].",

Owing to its fast proliferation, high expression levels and short fermentation time, Escherichia coli is the host bacterium most commonly used for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins [1]. However, E. coli is not always suitable for the production of active proteins on account of problems of insolubility, cytotoxicity, inefficient translation or the inability to carry out post-translational modifications [2]. In order to overcome these problems, other prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts have been used. Bacillus spp and Lactococcus are Gram-positive bacteria that are often used to secrete proteins into the culture medium [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells, insect cells or immortalized cell lines, are mainly used to produce active proteins with posttranslational modifications [9,10].\n\nStreptomyces is a promising bacterial expression system that has been used to produce high levels of several proteins [1,11]. Streptomycetes are aerobic, filamentous Gram-positive soil bacteria that secrete a wide range of extracellular enzymes to degrade a broad variety of substrates in order to survive.\n\nAs a host, Streptomyces has the following advantages over other systems: 1) the formation of inclusion bodies has not been described in the literature; 2) it is a wellsuited host for the expression of very GC-rich genes without codon adaptation [12]; 3) it has high protein secretion efficiency, which makes it feasible to obtain the protein of interest in the culture supernatant, facilitating the protein folding and downstream procedures of extraction and purification [11]; 4) the species used to express proteins (see below) display a relatively low level of endogenous extracellular proteolytic activity in comparison with other hosts such as Bacillus, where deletion of up to seven extracellular proteases had to be done to",

            "text": "In the coming years, there will be a significant increase in demand for high quality recombinant proteins. In response, biological systems used for the production of proteins must be scalable, cost-effective, safe and flexible enough to meet market requirements. Current systems rely on ''bio-factories,'' that is, mammalian, insect, yeast, and microbial cell cultures. The majority of the recombinant proteins are currently produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cells with a few exceptions of yeast or insect cells (Yin et al., 2007). All of these bio-factories are based on fermentation technology of suspension cells in bioreactors, which requires an enormous upfront capital investment and, thereby, severely constrains their scalability. \n\nThe use of plants as production systems for recombinant proteins has been actively investigated over the last two decades. Plants are attractive as protein factories because they can produce large volumes of products efficiently and sustainably and, under certain conditions, can have significant advantages in decreasing manufacturing costs (Hood et al., 1999;Giddings, 2001). Plant systems are far less likely to harbor microbes pathogenic to humans than mammalian cells or whole transgenic animal systems. In addition, one of the major advantages of plants is that they possess an endomembrane system and secretory pathway that are similar to mammalian cells (Vitale and Pedrazzini, 2005). Thus, proteins are generally efficiently assembled with appropriate post-translational modifications. These cost, scale, and safety advantages make plant-made pharmaceuticals very promising for both commercial pharmaceutical production and for manufacturing products destined for the developing world. \n\nThree approaches are commonly used to express heterologous proteins in plants: (1) stable transformation of the nuclear genome, (2) stable transformation of the chloroplastic genome, and (3) viral transient transformation. \n\nIn stable transformation technology, an expression cassette harboring the exogenous gene of interest is integrated into the nuclear or plastid genome of plant cells, which results in the acquired character to be stably inherited over generations. These lines can be propagated vegetatively or by seed and thus, readily scaled up for protein production.",

In her Perspective article, Bill arguments that the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris should be considered alongside E. coli in any project in need of a recombinant protein (Bill, 2014). Filamentous fungi are excellent protein secretors, a property that makes them ideal as a host at an industrial scale. Nevalainen and Peterson present an authoritative review describing the body of research carried out into cellular mechanisms of fungi that will ultimately lead to the optimization of the system (Nevalainen and Peterson, 2014). Specht and Mayfield explain the usefulness of microalgae as expression systems, focusing on the production of recombinant vaccines (Specht and Mayfield, 2014). The quest for edible vaccines is an active area of research and microalgae will definitely play a major role as they possess greater advantages over plants (which can also be used for this purpose) in terms of cost, safety, and logistics.",

            "text": "Plants including the whole body, specific tissues or organs and plant-derived suspension cells are considered as attractive and competitive platforms for recombinant protein production. Compared with Escherichia coli and mammalian cells, plant-based production systems have been demonstrated to have many advantages. First, plant-based production systems are more flexible, as well as easier to operate, manage, and scale up, and thus can decrease the production cost of recombinant proteins to a great extent. Second, plants, similar to mammalian cells, are able to perform post-translational modification of recombinant proteins such as glycosylation, and thus additional cost for in vitro protein modifications can be avoided (Frenzel et al., 2013;Sil and Jha, 2014;Kolotilin et al., 2015). Third, long-term continuous recombinant protein production can be realized in plant platforms because transgenes can be stably integrated into the nuclear genome of host plants, faithfully inherited, and expressed in later generations. Furthermore, plant-derived recombinant proteins may be safer than those from E. coli or mammalian cells because the risk of contamination with human pathogens, which is always a concern when using mammalian cells as a bioreactor, can be well circumvented by plant-based production systems (Thie et al., 2008;Ni and Chen, 2009;Merlin et al., 2014). Because of these properties, various bioactive pharmaceutical proteins have been produced in plants since first expression of a human growth hormone in transgenic tobacco and sunflower callus tissue (Barta et al., 1986), and expression of antibodies, vaccines, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines (De Muynck et al., 2010;Desai et al., 2010;Xu et al., 2011;Huang and McDonald, 2012). \n\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are protein complexes containing four subunits with two identical light chains (LC) and two identical heavy chains (HC). MAbs are important in biological research, clinical diagnosis, and recently immunotherapy for various diseases and cancer (De Muynck et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Selecting an appropriate host system for producing peptide-protein conjugates is crucial and largely depends on the protein structural complexity, required yield, and necessary post-translational modifications (PtMs) for functionality. Host cells can be prokaryotic cells or eukaryotic cells. the most common prokaryotic host is E. coli, while eukaryotic hosts include yeasts, insect cells, and mammalian cells (Amann et al., 2019). \n\nBacterial systems are preferred for expressing simpler peptides and proteins that do not require complex PtMs. Escherichia coli is widely used due to its rapid growth rate, high protein yield, cost-effectiveness, and ease of genetic manipulation. Escherichia coli is particularly suited for peptides that lack disulfide bonds or glycosylation, as bacteria do not possess the cellular machinery to perform eukaryotic PtMs. Moreover, complex protein folding can be problematic, and high expression levels may result in the formation of inclusion bodies (Bhatwa et al., 2021;Manissorn et al., 2023). \n\nyeast systems offer a combination of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of bacterial systems with the capacity to perform eukaryotic PtMs, such as glycosylation, though with slight structural differences from mammalian systems. yeasts are suitable for expressing more complex peptides or proteins that require proper folding and PtMs for activity. Pichia pastoris is particularly favored for producing therapeutic proteins at high yields (Shrivastava et al., 2023). Although yeast systems can handle more complex proteins, the glycosylation patterns that they produce differ from those in mammalian cells, potentially affecting bioactivity and therapeutic efficacy (varki, 2022). Furthermore, peptides with highly complex modifications may not achieve optimal functionality. insect cell systems, such as Sf9 and Sf21 cells from Spodoptera frugiperda and High Five cells from Trichoplusia ni, are increasingly favored for expressing complex peptides and proteins, particularly those requiring PtMs that are challenging to achieve in bacterial or yeast systems (liu et al., 2013). insect cells can be grown in high-density cultures and in Table 1.",

This article highlights the benefits of using yeast, especially for more challenging targets such as membrane proteins. On account of the wide range of molecular, genetic, and microbiological tools available, use of the well-studied model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides many opportunities to optimize the functional yields of a target protein. Despite this wealth of resources, it is surprisingly under-used. In contrast, Pichia pastoris, a relative new-comer as a host organism, is already becoming a popular choice, particularly because of the ease with which high biomass (and hence recombinant protein) yields can be achieved. In the last few years, advances have been made in understanding how a yeast cell responds to the stress of producing a recombinant protein and how this information can be used to identify improved host strains in order to increase functional yields. Given these advantages, and their industrial importance in the production of biopharmaceuticals, I argue that S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris should be considered at an early stage in any serious strategy to produce proteins.",

            "text": "A myriad of organisms (or their derivatives) can be chosen as hosts for recombinant protein production. The list includes bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, mammalian, plant and insect cells or transgenic organisms (plants and animals) [52]. Although there is a lot to choose from, the selection of the most appropriate expression host is often limited to a few options given the intrinsic characteristics of the protein and the process to be developed. For low scale protein production (mainly for research purposes), intrinsic attributes of the protein are usually the most important parameter, but for large scale production (industrial scale) other criteria are also relevant. A summary of the factors that influence the host selection for low and industrial scale can be found in Table 2. \n\nIn either production scale, the intrinsic characteristics of the protein are of the utmost importance. These include the requirement for post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, phosphorylation, acetylation, acylation, carboxylation and other modifications that can affect folding and activity [53]. Some of these modifications can be performed in vitro, namely in refolding strategies, but this is often not ideal. The production level is also very important in both cases because if a protein is inherently unstable in a given host, or if the host is for any reason incapable of expressing it in reasonable amounts, another system must be used. This may be related to the codon bias of the gene (which can be easily solved), but also to the instability of the produced mRNA, the susceptibility to attack by host proteases (protease deficient hosts are sometimes available), the incompatibility with secretion, or the deficient folding and aggregation in a particular host or cellular compartment. The technical expertise of the staff/researcher may also be an important factor. In the lab, prior experience with a certain system may introduce a certain bias to a particular host and in industrial settings, a small diversity of \"cell factories\" is often used in a given facility so that the staff becomes highly experienced in dealing with the peculiarities of each system. \n\nThe cell growth rate is important in both production scales, but it has a much larger impact in industrial production.",

It defines the technology needed for the project, be it a variety of molecular tools, equipment, or reagents. Among microorganisms, host systems that are available include bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. All have strengths and weaknesses and their choice may be subject to the protein of interest (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Adrio and Demain, 2010). For example, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like protein glycosylation) are needed, a prokaryotic expression system may not be suitable (Sahdev et al., 2008). In this review, we will focus specifically on Escherichia coli. Other systems are described in excellent detail in accompanying articles of this series.\n\nThe advantages of using E. coli as the host organism are well known. (i) It has unparalleled fast growth kinetics. In glucose-salts media and given the optimal environmental conditions, its doubling time is about 20 min (Sezonov et al., 2007). This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996;Shiloach and Fass, 2005). However, exponential growth in www.frontiersin.org complex media leads to densities nowhere near that number. In the simplest laboratory setup (i.e., batch cultivation of E. coli at 37 \u2022 C, using LB media), <1 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml may be the upper limit (Sezonov et al., 2007), which is less than 0.1% of the theoretical limit. For this reason, high cell-density culture methods were",

            "text": "Biomanufacturing of heterologous proteins from genetically engineered cell factories is a growing industry. The first such biopharmaceutical product was approved by the FDA four decades ago (U.S. Food Drug Administration, 1982;Nielsen, 2013), and now over 300 different biopharmaceuticals are available (Walsh, 2018). Beyond delivering many life-saving drugs, biopharmaceutical protein production serves as an economically profitable industry representing an expanding multi-billiondollar global market (Walsh, 2018;Mordor Intelligence, 2021). Apart from this, commercial protein products for industrial and research applications are also produced in engineered cells and likewise constitute a growing industry (Baghban et al., 2019). However, despite many previous and ongoing successes, continued bioengineering of cell factories is required for more robust and reliable production of heterologous protein. \n\nToday, an assorted palette of living organisms with distinct advantages and disadvantages are used for industrial-scale heterologous protein production, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cell lines (Dumont et al., 2016). Depending on the protein product of interest, developers choose the most appropriate host organism based on quality and quantity (Porro et al., 2011). Yeast represents an attractive host for the production of many types of heterologous proteins when compared to other host systems. \n\nThe first heterologous protein product released to the market was human insulin produced in an engineered strain of Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA technology and branded as Humulin TM (U. S. Food Drug Administration, 1982). Since then, bacterial expression systems have been a popular choice for producing multiple heterologous proteins since they replicate quickly in cheap growth media and, in general, produce high protein titers (Karbalaei et al., 2020). On the other hand, they lack the capacity to perform necessary post-translational modifications required, especially for many pharmaceutical proteins to be active (Ghaderi et al., 2012). Most bacteria, including E. coli, are also unable to successfully secrete such proteins, requiring added cell harvesting, cell disruption, and product isolation steps before protein purification (Lalor et al., 2019).",

However, while achieving high product yield at low cost is much coveted, it is important to consider the structural quality of the produced molecules as the selection of expression system can heavily influence the type and degree of the product's structure, particularly glycosylation [29]. Some main traits of a good host for therapeutic production are rapid development, known organelles and functions for protein processing and secretion, as well as possessing strain engineering toolkits to integrate recombinant protein into host genome and engineer post-translational modifications [72]. Additionally, intrinsic qualities such as proven specific productivities, lack of cosecreted proteases, proteome's amount of host cell proteins, process flexibility, and absence of mammalian viral infectivity, in addition to other factors including usage of cheaper, less-refined feeds, along with robustness to shear stress, pH, and temperature can direct the selection of a prospective host as well [71]. Recombinant proteins such as antibodies can be expressed using various platforms and there have been multiple expression systems identified.\n\nThe most common strategy for producing recombinant proteins is using bacteria, typically Escherichia coli but, the foreign protein being toxic to the host, besides, protein folding machinery differences, and the absence of post-translational modifications in bacteria makes them inapt hosts for expression of functional eukaryotic proteins [8]. Yeast, insect, and plant cell-based expression systems are applicable as well but unfortunately, they form glycan structures, unlike a human's which carries the risk of undesired immunogenicity for therapeutics [29]. Additionally, the development of the aforementioned systems are fragmented, making it challenging to compare them to mammalian cell lines for potential benefits [71].\n\nAs a result, the primary framework for generation for therapeutic recombinant proteins is utilising mammalian cell lines as for ectopically expressed mammalian genes, they are the nearest likeness to the native environment and in this way have an inherent capability to create functional mammalian proteins [8].

Furthermore, the authenticity of glycosylation performed by mammalian host cells is an important advantage over all other expression hosts. However, progress in the technologies that enable reproducible gene delivery and selection of stable clones continues to be slow (Bandaranayake and Almo, 2013). Moreover, specific yields from mammalian cell-lines are often low (Zhu, 2012) and Table 1 shows a declining trend in their use. \n\nEukaryotic microbes offer substantial advantages as host cells, despite their propensity to hyperglycosylate recombinant proteins. For example, an annotated genome sequence has been available for S. cerevisiae for almost two decades (Goffeau et al., 1996), an impressive range of deletion and over-expression strains are readily available for S. cerevisiae and the P. pastoris genome has been available since 2009 (De Schutter et al., 2009). Combining this wealth of molecular and genetic resources, with the fact that yeasts grow an order of magnitude more rapidly than mammalian cell-lines means that protein production and optimization can be done quickly and efficiently in yeast (Porro et al., 2011). Table 1 shows that for P. pastoris, at least, there is an increasing trend in its usage suggesting that these advantages have become more widely known. This is especially notable because P. pastoris is a relative new-comer, only having been first developed as a host system in 1985 (Cregg et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are foreign proteins produced in various expression systems. They are mainly used as pharmaceuticals for diagnostics, for the vaccination of humans or animals, and as drugs or monoclonal antibodies [1]. The ever-growing demand for recombinant proteins stimulates the development of various expression systems for the production of these proteins that meet the existing stringent standards. Today, recombinant proteins are mainly produced in traditional prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli, several yeast species, and mammalian cell cultures. More than 50% of all pharmaceutical recombinant proteins are synthesized in mammalian cells [2,3]. Mammalian cells are necessary for the production of complex proteins because bacteria cannot form disulfide bonds efficiently and neither bacteria nor yeast can add human-like post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the secretory pathway [4]. Protein production in mammalian cells is expensive due to the high cost of the culture media components. Moreover, some recombinant proteins, such as immunotoxins or regulatory proteins, are toxic to mammalian cells. Production of biopharmaceuticals in plant expression systems is becoming a promising alternative to existing platforms based on mammalian and bacterial cells [2,5,6]. The cultivation of plant cells under controlled conditions of bioreactors ensures the production of high-quality protein according to GMP standards. The advantages of plant expression systems are rapid cell growth, low cost of nutrient media components, the low risk of contamination with animal pathogens, as well as the possibility of obtaining recombinant proteins with a modified human-type glycosylation profile. \n\nPlant cell cultures as a system for the production of recombinant proteins, however, have several drawbacks, the main one of which is associated with a low yield of recombinant protein, which rarely exceeds 100 \u00b5g/kg of fresh weight, despite significant efforts to optimize protein expression and stability [6]. In whole plants, the problem of low yield of the target protein can be overcome by transient expression. Transient expression systems have surpassed the challenge of rapid and high-yield expression of recombinant proteins in plants, allowing for gram-sized quantities to be attained in as little as 5 days [7,8].",

We have reviewed many examples of production using each system. In the future, demands for plant-based biopharmaceuticals will increase. Most importantly, the economic feasibility of producing useful recombinant proteins will determine the viability of companies that have just started industrializing this process. Any successful strategy must make good use of the advantages of producing \"bio-betters\" by selecting suitable methodologies to overcome the low price of mass production in E. coli and the excellent efficacy of animal cells. Of the production systems discussed in this review, transient expression systems have been most frequently adopted by different companies, with 16 market-releasable items that are safe and environmentally friendly currently in indoor or outdoor trials [119]. Bioreactor-based cell culture systems, which can be rapidly scaled-up and are free of mammalian pathogens, have been adopted by traditional fermentation-based companies. Despite this, the situation concerning GM plants is still not always favorable and some major hurdles remain. The final goal, namely, the production of a plant-based vaccine in fresh plant materials that can be eaten, is yet to be achieved. Given market prices, the large capacity required, and the general understanding of plant biopharmaceuticals by the general population, it is difficult to challenge the dominance of conventional production platforms based on E.\n\ncoli, mammalian cells, and yeast. However, recent advances in plant molecular farming allow very large-scale, even multi-tonne scale, production of plant-based pharmaceuticals. The positive trend is that many researchers try to start a venture based on technology acquired from the laboratory. Thus, technologies from various fields will converge and continue to develop; eventually, clinical products produced using these systems will enter the market.",

Based on searches of the PubMed citation database, the use of P. pastoris as an expression host has increased from 4% to 17% of the total recombinant genes reported on from 1995 to 2009 (Fig. 1). Within the same time period, the usage of E. coli as an expression host remained constant, with approximately 60% of the recombinant genes reported on in journals indexed in PubMed being expressed in E. coli. Similar trends prevailed when analyzing publications in the journal Microbial Cell Factories during the period from 2005 to 2009 (Fig. 1). Several other expression systems are widely used, but to a lesser extent than E. coli and P. pastoris. So, why are E. coli and P. pastoris particularly suited for recombinant gene expression? Protein produced from a recombinant gene in E. coli as a soluble and functional product with high yield is the ideal situation for most research and industrial protein production purposes [2][3][4]. However, this situation is far from realistic for all recombinant gene products. In particular, proteins derived from eukaryotes are prone to inclusion body formation and low yields. This outcome can be explained by the fact that the rate of gene translation in E. coli is 4-to 10-fold higher than in eukaryotes [5]. Correct formation of disulfide bonds, protein folding, and protein function must be carefully assessed both when the proteins have been recombinantly produced in E. coli in a soluble form, when they have been refolded in vitro, or obtained from any other source [6]. Further, E. coli should not be used as the expression system if posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are of importance for the study or purpose of the protein because these microbes are unable to incorporate PTMs, including Nlinked glycan chains.",

It is difficult to decide which combination of host organism-promoter system would be the best for specific recombinant protein production; therefore this still has to be optimized for each product individually. \n\nSince Escherichia coli have all the above described advantages [1] and the laboratory strains are regarded as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organisms, it is still one of the most commonly used bacterial host system, not only on laboratory scale use, but also for production of therapeutic proteins [2][3][4][5]. \n\nHowever, during recombinant protein production in E. coli, proteins often tend to aggregate into protein particles called inclusion bodies (IBs). Until recently, IBs were considered as deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins and represented bottleneck in recombinant protein production. Therefore many pharmaceutically interesting proteins have been disregarded for commercialization [6]. Nevertheless, the latest studies on protein aggregation have shown that protein aggregation into IBs does not necessarily imply protein inactivation [7][8][9][10] thus studies on protein aggregation has become an important subject in many fields, including biology, medicine and biotechnology [11]. This article gives an overview on the latest trends in recombinant protein production in E. coli, their aggregation and the possible applications of such protein particles (IBs).",

For example, IgG expression titre in mouse hybridoma cell culture was increased by as much as 50% when the cells were grown in culture media with 33% spent media supplementation [7]. Conversely, feeding the cells with 100% spent media led to a significant decrease in growth and protein production by the mammalian cells. This decrease was attributed to the build-up of auto-inhibitory metabolites and lack of nutrients. \n\nGenetic engineering of a wide array of bacteria has been a central pillar of the development of the circular bioeconomy, enabling new product development from diverse organic waste streams including food oils, agrochemical waste and used bioplastics [10][11][12][13][14][15]. We aimed to test our hypothesis using Escherichia coli, a robust and versatile bacteriological expression host that is widely used commercially to produce recombinant proteins. The production of recombinant human insulin in E. coli for example, is a major milestone in human drug production [16,17]. E. coli has been shown to utilize breakdown metabolites such as lactate present in spent culture medias [18] and can grow successfully in spent media from the fermentation of other cell types [9]. \n\nComparative analysis of culture growth rates of an E. coli BL21 strain harbouring a recombinant mCherry-EF2 expression construct in rich microbiological media (LB) and in chemically defined spent media (CDSM) that had previously been used to culture CHO cells, either with or without supplementation, confirmed CDSM as a viable feed for bacterial fermentation. Analysis of recombinant protein production by the cultures confirmed equivalent recombinant protein titres post-purification when compared to LB.",

            "title": "Enhanced soluble expression of active recombinant human interleukin-29 using champion pET SUMO system",
            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

The slight increase in E. coli products is partially due to the uptick of biosimilars' market approvals, a growth market for biological drugs. 16 In the beginning of the century, 20 pharmaceutical proteins were produced by transgenic technology for clinical trials. 95 The high developmental costs for transgenic protein production at an industrial scale clearly hinder the advancement of this method, 95,96 also seen by the approval of only four pharmaceutical proteins using this production method, outlined in Figure 2. Another problem for transgenic production arises during the development phase of the final product. The turnover from gene to production strain is much slower using animal hosts than when cells or cell-free systems. Here, mammalian systems are again slower than bacterial systems, while cell-free systems have the fastest turnover rate.",

            "text": "correctly-folded, purified protein; a focus on data extracted from the PDB has therefore allowed us to identify systems that have the capability of producing the required quantity and quality of these challenging targets. This review updates our previous study [8] of E. coli expression systems and extends that work to include S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. Together, these three host systems account for the production of the vast majority of recombinant membrane proteins in microbes, although Lactococcus lactis (see PDB entry 4US3), Pseudomonas fluorescens (5KUD) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (2PNO) have also been used successfully as microbial cell factories in a minority of cases.\n\nIn November 2017, of the 729 unique membrane protein structures (uMPS) derived from recombinant proteins and deposited in the PDB, 521 were produced in microbial host cells. E. coli was clearly the cell factory of choice (producing 468 uMPS, Tables 1 and 2), followed by the yeast hosts, P. pastoris (31 uMPS, Table 3) and S. cerevisiae (22 uMPS, Table 4). Table 5 summarizes the use of microbial expression systems and the origin of the target uMPS. With a growing number of uMPS being deposited in the PDB, heterologous membrane protein production is becoming dominant over the production of homologous targets. Higher eukaryotic uMPS, in particular, have more recently been obtained using all three microbial systems (Table 5).\n\nYeast expression systems have been used almost exclusively in the production of large, eukaryotic membrane proteins; in the case of P. pastoris, the targets were mainly of mammalian and plant origin (Table 3). Yeast hosts have mainly produced \u03b1-helical membrane proteins, while E. coli has also been used to produce \u03b2-barrel proteins, probably because many such proteins are found natively in the E. coli outer membrane (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows that above 500-600 amino acids (\u223c50-60 kDa), the number of uMPS decreases dramatically, suggesting that E. coli cannot efficiently produce large proteins; this may be because ribosomes drop off very long",

            "text": "Currently, mAbs are largely produced in mammalian expression systems. This technique is attractive in terms of its high expression efficiency and its ability to produce large, complex proteins. \n\nAntibody production requires a large number of cultured mammalian cells, resulting in low production rate, extremely high production costs, and technically challenging fermentation and puri\ue103cation steps. 7,8 Alternative mAbs production systems in microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) is more desirable due to its simplicity and reduced production time and costs. 9 Currently, two antigen-binding fragments (Fab)-Lucentis\u00ae and Cimzia\u00ae-are commercially available and produced in the E. coli system, indicating that E. coli may be useful for industrial scale antibody production. 10 Early attempts to produce full-length IgG in E. coli was in the form of inclusion bodies in the cytoplasmic space 11 or in the soluble form in the periplasmic space. 12,13 Drastic improvements have recently been made to engineer E. coli strains which are suitable for the expression of multi-disul\ue103de bond proteins, called SHuffle strains. 14 In 2015, Robinson et al. reported the \ue103rst soluble expression of active, full-length IgGs in the cytoplasm of SHuffle E. coli cells, an achievement that was not possible in wild-type E. coli. 15 Moreover, they showed that these cytoplasmic IgGs produced in E. coli, termed 'cyclonals' could be redirect to different target antigens by simply swapping the Fv domains while keeping the same scaffold. Genetic manipulation is also easier and more bene\ue103cial when using E. coli as a host, since many antibody engineering techniques such as gra\ue09ding alternative epitope recognition domains, humanizing, and Fc engineering can be utilized to rapidly create custom mouse, rabbit, or humanized antibodies on demand. \n\nAntibody efficacy is largely dependent upon their atomic interactions with an antigen. A longer binding time of antibody-antigen results in a higher antibody efficacy, resulting in the use of a lower drug dose. In the present study, to determine an effective humanized mAb speci\ue103c for VEGF, three gra\ue09ded antibodies (chimeric, CDR and SDR-gra\ue09ding) were designed and constructed.",

            "text": "Production of recombinant protein using plant expression system first dates back to the 1980s when plants' genetic transformability has been confirmed [1]. Soon after, human growth hormone and antibody chains were produced using transgenic tobacco and sunflower [2,3]. In 1997, recombinant avidin was produced commercially using transgenic maize, affirming plants' capabilities to produce recombinant proteins on a large scale [4]. Since then, numerous antibodies, vaccines, cytokines and other proteins have been produced using plant expression systems in the forms of both mature plants and tissue cell cultures [5]. Plants have numerous advantages over other expression systems such as intrinsic safety (plants are free of animal pathogens and viruses, and they can be grown without using animal-derived materials), lower production and capital costs, and glycosylation pattern similar to that of humans [5][6][7]. Among these advantages, plants' ability to perform complex post-translational modification is particularly important because it allows for the production of complicated glycoproteins with glycosylation, which plays major roles in the bioactivity and stability of certain proteins [8,9]. Rice is a well-studied model plant whose genome has been decoded, and its transformation technology has been very well developed [10,11]. As the third most produced crop in the world, rice is also considered to be hypoallergenic, making it an excellent host for protein production and even administration [12]. Recent reports indicate that rice is a suitable host for recombinant protein due to its competitive yield of certain recombinant proteins, such as human serum albumin, compared to other plant expression systems such as tobacco cell cultures and potato tubers [13][14][15][16]. Suspension cell culture is a widely used method for producing recombinant proteins, and systems upscaled into bioreactors have been utilized commercially [7,17]. Bioreactors have numerous advantages including lower capital and production costs, scalability, safety from viral transmission and other mammalian pathogens [17,18].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely used protein production host in academia and a major host for industrial protein production. However, recombinant production of eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotes has challenges. One of these is post-translational modifications, including native disulfide bond formation. Proteins containing disulfide bonds have traditionally been made by targeting to the periplasm or by in vitro refolding of proteins made as inclusion bodies. More recently, systems for the production of disulfide-containing proteins in the cytoplasm have been introduced. However, it is unclear if these systems have the capacity for the production of disulfide-rich eukaryotic proteins. To address this question, we tested the capacity of one such system to produce domain constructs, containing up to 44 disulfide bonds, of the mammalian extracellular matrix proteins mucin 2, alpha tectorin, and perlecan. All were successfully produced with purified yields up to 6.5 mg/L. The proteins were further analyzed using a variety of biophysical techniques including circular dichroism spectrometry, thermal stability assay, and mass spectrometry. These analyses indicated that the purified proteins are most likely correctly folded to their native state. This greatly extends the use of E. coli for the production of eukaryotic proteins for structural and functional studies.",

            "text": "Recombinant expression presents a solid option for producing AFPs at low cost and high efficiency. In addition, sequencing technologies have generated a vast amount of genomic and transcriptomic data, providing valuable resources for discovering and designing new and more active AFPs (Amaral et al., 2012;Porto et al., 2012;Tracanna et al., 2017). Bacteria (mainly Escherichia coli), yeasts (mainly P. pastoris), and plants (e.g., tobacco plant Nicotiana tabacum) are the most common expression platforms for recombinant proteins. \n\nE. coli BL21 (DE3), deficient in proteases that may lead to protein degradation, is by far the most commonly used bacterial species as a host for recombinant production of proteins (Li, 2011). Many E. coli strains are unable to export proteins across their outer membrane. As a result, in the majority of cases, proteins are secreted into the cytoplasm or periplasm, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015). Examples of AFPs produced in E. coli include lactoferricin B, nikkomycin, magainin-2, and cecropin (Fern\u00e1ndez de Ullivarri et al., 2020). \n\nIn contrast to prokaryotic E. coli, eukaryotic yeasts are capable of implementing certain post-translational modifications to heterologous recombinant proteins. Yeasts commonly used as hosts for recombinant proteins include S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Hansenula polymorpha. For example, the recombinant antifungal proteins serum albumin and hen lysozyme were produced by K. lactis and S. cerevisiae, respectively (Vieira Gomes et al., 2018). In addition, filamentous fungi such as A. pullulans, P. Chrysogenum, and P. digitatum have also been used to generate AFPs.",

The classic baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most-characterized eukaryotic and extensively utilized host for recombinant therapeutic proteins, but other yeast species, such as Pichia pastoris, Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, have also been established as efficient hosts for their production. \n\nMany mammalian cell lines have been used to express proteins; the most widely used ones are CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney), but also, cell lines such as J558L and Sp2/0 from myeloma, Vero cells, mouse L-cells, and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells are frequently used as hosts to create stable transfectants. These cells are used to express a variety of heterologous proteins, from viral structural proteins to bioactive peptides, even though their use in large-scale industrial production has been limited by high cost, complex technology, and potential for animal virus contamination. \n\nBaculovirus/insect systems are often used to obtain high levels of expression of recombinant glycoprotein to produce vaccines and used for gene therapy because this latter is safe for vertebrates, but continuous expression via fermentation is not possible [1], thus limiting its application at productive levels. \n\nOne of the key challenges in producing recombinant proteins is achieving a delicate balance to obtain properly folded proteins with the precise disulfide pattern (if present). This is particularly important in toxin production, given the inherent paradox where an increase in toxin production may poison host cells, compromising their viability and, consequently, the production of the toxin itself. Potential self-intoxication must also be considered when identifying the most suitable expression system.",

            "text": "Biotechnological production has opened new approaches to produce spider silk proteins from other sources like bacteria, plants, yeasts, cells, or animals, to provide costefficient and stable fabrication [68]. The most commonly used proteins are derived from sequences isolated from the species Nephila clavipes and Araneus diadematus [13]. \n\nRecombinant protein production involves the following steps [69]: \n\n\u2022 Determining the sequence of nucleotides in natural DNA (isolation of the desired sequence that encodes the target protein); \u2022 Designing recombinant DNA; \u2022 Selection of the vector that will enable the transmission of the desired sequence; \u2022 Transmission of the vector into the host's organism (bacteria, yeast, plants, insect cells, mammalian cells, and transgenic animals); \u2022 Cultivation/production of proteins in the host organism; \u2022 Isolation of the obtained proteins. \n\nA schematic representation of the recombinant spider silk proteins' production, sources, and possible biomaterials is shown in Figure 2. \n\nOrganisms used as hosts for silk protein fabrication can be different and the most commonly used hosts, as shown in Figure 2, are bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeasts like Pichia pastoris, and mammalian cells like hamster kidney cells, but insect cells can also be used, like Spodoptera frugiperda. E. coli proved to be the most suitable host due to a high density of cells that grow fast and can be easily transformed. Biotechnological manipulation and production allow the modification and improvement of silk characteristics [70]. \n\nSignificant progress has been made in recombinant spider silk production, but further improvements are necessary to overcome the main challenges of high investments and small product yields [67]. Additionally, the commercial use of recombinant spider silk has been limited due to the inability to produce spidroins at their natural size. For example, transgenic mammals and insects have the potential to produce larger proteins, which are easier to purify. However, growing such organisms is costly, and the yields are typically low. On the other hand, E. coli is relatively affordable to cultivate, but it is not efficient in expressing larger spidroins [71].",

            "text": "Yeasts, the single-celled eukaryotic fungal organisms, are commonly applied to production of recombinant proteins that are not be able to be expressed well in E.coli because of difficulties such as mis-folding or lack of glycosylation. The major advantages of yeast expression systems include; high yield, stable production, cost effectiveness, mammalian-like PTMs, proper folding of S-S rich proteins and high density growth. Also, yeasts have some considerable benefits compared to insect or mammalian cells. They are easier to handle, less expensive and are easily adaptable to fermentation processes. 56 The three most utilized yeast strains are Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) and Hansenula polymorpha (H. polymorpha). However, glycosylation by S. cerevisiae is often unacceptable for mammalian proteins because the O-linked oligosaccharides contain only mannose; furthermore, it may cause immunological reactions against the produced recombinant proteins in the body. For overcoming these problems, the methylotrophic yeasts can be used instead of S. cerevisiae for production of recombinant proteins. Methylotrophic yeasts are cost effective hosts and they can produces high levels of recombinant proteins with considerable stability. 62 Endostatin has two disulfide bonds in its structure that is essential to its folding and function. One of the best advantages of P. pastoris over E. coli is its ability to produce disulfide bonds of proteins. This means that in this situation where disulfides are important, E. coli might produce a misfolded protein, which is usually inactive or insoluble. Also, Pichia usually gives much better yields, compared to other expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or S2-cells from Drosophila melanogaster. 63 Additionally, production of recombinant proteins such as endostatin in P. pastoris is more economical. One of the most notable properties for expression systems is having strong and strictly adjustable promoter that methylotrophic yeasts have these advantages. 62",

            "text": "The production of proteins in adequate quantity and quality is a necessary demand of the present time. Before we begin any bio therapeutic development program, we must pay close attention in choosing a suitable host system for the expression of recombinant proteins. Since a gene can be expressed in multiple systems and different hosts, and it can express proteins with different efficiencies as well as variant posttranslational modifications, determining the best system for expression of recombinant proteins is one of the most important issues in biotechnology. A recombinant protein expression system must be able to produce the biological material with the highest biological activity and safety while it has the lowest cost. Scientists must also consider the expression system's productivity, consistency, and the current regulatory environment (1). \n\nThere are numerous available expression systems for large scale production of recombinant proteins includ-ing Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeast, insect, and several mammalian based systems. Each of these has its own relevant advantages depending on cost, simplicity, and their post-translational modification profiles (2). Now, some famous companies are using eukaryotic systems to produce recombinant proteins. Among them, mammalian expression systems are the main expression systems for the production of recombinant human proteins. Mammalian cell expression systems have several advantages over other eukaryotic expression systems (3). Mammalian expression systems are able to fulfill the appropriate posttranslational modifications, which are important for protein folding, product assemblies, and biological activity. However, it should be noted that there are differences between species. A large number of mammalian cells including myeloma (NS0 and SP2/0) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human retina-derived cells (PerC6), COS and Vero (both green African monkey kidney), Human cervical cancer (HeLa), human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, as well as baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells have been successfully used to express recombinant proteins (2).",

            "text": "In the production of biopharmaceuticals, recombinant pharmacologically active proteins became an important segment of high-tech economy with great potential for further expansion. Industrial pharmaceutical biotechnology offers drugs required in medicine and research, which either cannot be obtained in other way besides heterologous expression, or their isolation from natural sources incurs high economic costs. For the large-scale production of recombinant proteins, the key features of the suitable expression system (and, in a broader sense, technology platform) include scalability of technology, yields of the protein product, and costs of production. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host for the production of recombinant proteins including the industrial technologies. However, some valuable proteins cannot be produced in a biologically active form in bacteria. These include, among others, the erythropoietin and the anti-hemophilic factor VIII, which are produced for medical use in the mammalian cell cultures. For other pharmacologically active proteins, such as G-CSF, a variety of production systems are available-employing expression in bacteria, yeast, plants, and cultured animal cells. Still, expression in homologous host often provides product with better properties for the end-user. For example, one form of the G-CSF produced in industrial scales in the E.coli is present in the market with an international non-proprietary name (INN) \"Filgrastim\" and a large number of patented brand marks. Different form of G-CSF is produced in the in vitro cultured CHO cells, which are transformed with the eukaryotic expression plasmid. This kind of G-CSF has INN \"Lenograstim,\" whereas Filgrastim lacks glycosylation and bears non-natural formylmethionine residue at the N-terminus. Lenograstim is fully equivalent to the 174 aa natural human G-CSF. Lenograstim has greater potency compared to Filgrastim, probably because it is more stable to proteolysis (Ataergin et al., 2008). \n\nExpression vectors constitute crucial parts of the technological platforms for production of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "E. coli is by far the most used prokaryotic microorganism for recombinant production of lipases, followed by the Gram-positive soil bacterium B. subtilis. Hence, according to Borrelli and Trono [42], E. coli represents 50% of the total heterologous production of lipases by eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts. This dominant position in the production hierarchy has been earned by the more than 40 years of intensive use as production host and the even longer record of serving as one of the most important biological model organisms. As a result, E. coli is likely the best understood organism on the planet with a superior genetic toolbox and profound insights into its genetics and physiology. Together, these advantages have been used to construct highly efficient E. coli based cell factories for heterologous protein production, and there are examples where the new protein constitutes 30% of the total intracellular content of proteins. Moreover, E. coli based processes are typically easy to manipulate and scale-up due to consolidated methodologies of fermentation, cloning and expression with different strains, protocols and studies available. Many strategies are available to optimize a production process. For example, in the context of recombinant lipases, purification can be simplified by fusing the lipase gene to sequences encoding signal peptides (PelB and OmpA) as they will direct the proteins to the periplasmic space. Moreover, yields of soluble protein may be increased by coexpression with chaperones (GroES, GroEL and ClpB). In the first case, the enzyme could be recovered by ultrasonication or other cell lysis processes. The co-expression with chaperones enables the correct folding of the lipase, increases its solubility and decreases protein aggregation. Molecular chaperones are included in a family of unrelated classes of protein that mediate the correct assembly of other polypeptides-i.e., correct folding [66]. \n\nThe major limitations of using E. coli as an expression host include its inability to secrete large amounts of proteins or to perform post-translational modifications (PTMs)-i.e., protein glycosylation.",

Optimization of recombinant protein expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems has been carried out by varying simple parameters such as expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature.

            "text": "Many expression systems successfully produce MPs (Table 1). The most suitable host is usually selected after iterative screening guided by MP target origin. We prefer to express prokaryotic MPs in Escherichia coli (E. coli) which can be quickly grown in HTP using inexpensive media, in small or large volumes and at high cell density [14]. The bacteriophage T7 promotor, often used for MP expression, can lead to overloading of the bacterial quality control system and accumulation of MPs in inclusion bodies [15,16]. Mitigation efforts drove the development of alternative bacterial expression hosts [15,17,18] and several E. coli strains temper the effects of the T7 promoter [19,20]. Other strains improve the expression levels of specific MPs [21] but MP functionality depends upon the strain [22]. Typically, we screen 4-6 E. coli strains to establish the best production conditions.\n\nEukaryotic MPs are expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts [2]. We generally avoid prokaryotic hosts as they lack essential lipids and machinery for post-translational modifications (PTMs). Other microbial expression systems including Saccharomyces cerevisiae [25] and Pichia pastoris [26] have been employed when bacterial systems fail. Yeast are cheaper, easier to genetically manipulate and grow than other eukaryotic hosts, are capable of some essential PTMs [2], but lack essential lipids, impairing human MP production [33]. Insect cells present an alternative to yeast [27,28] but use baculoviral vectors for construct delivery which is time consuming [28]. We find that the ExpiSf system [34] improves production efficiency by maintaining higher cell densities. However, insect cells have a less well-regulated quality control system that results in accumulation of unfolded, inactive protein compared with mammalian cell lines [35]. Transient transfection, baculovirus transduction or stable transfection facilitate MP expression in mammalian hosts [5,30,36]. During initial screening, we use transient transfection, which utilises chemical agents to introduce non-integrating plasmid DNA into cells.

            "text": "Since the advent of production of recombinant proteins, application of therapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals was changed remarkably (Walsh 2014). These proteins are required in huge amount and usually can not be obtained from natural sources due to extremely low availability. Moreover, Genetically engineered proteins with special benefits (e.g. Insulin analogs) are as such molecules which can therefore only be obtained via recombinant technology (Walsh 2000(Walsh , 2006;;Sanchez and Demain 2012). Escherichia coli was the first and still popularly used host for the fast and economical production of recombinant proteins (Vincentelli and Romier 2013;Chance et al. 1981;Choi and Lee 2004;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014;Lebendiker and Danieli 2014). In-depth knowledge of genetic and biochemical pathways of E. coli and availability of variety of vectors made is an attractive host for such purposes. Although significant improvements have been made at transcription, translation and translocation, still obtaining soluble and bioactive proteins is a major challenge (Pines and Inouye 1999;Baneyx 1999;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). \n\nSecreted proteins such as antibodies, enzymes, hormones etc. are used for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Secreted proteins having two or more cysteines makes disulfide bonds, which is usually vital for structure formation and bioactivity (Creighton 1997b;Creighton et al. 1995;Clarke and Fersht 1993). The cytosol of E. coli is reducing which gives inclusion bodies when such proteins are expressed in the cytosol (Freedman 1989;Hwang et al. 1992;Aslund et al. 1994;Carmel-Harel and Storz 2000;Russel 1995;Messens and Collet 2006). Usually in vitro oxidative refolding is difficult, laborious, time consuming and may be uneconomical depending upon refolding yield (Lilie et al. 1998;Lange and Rudolph 2009;Yamaguchi et al. 2013;Basu et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Protein-based drugs are big business. The market for biopharmaceuticals is growing faster than the pharmaceuticals market as a whole, and a recent projection suggested the value of this segment could reach $US 278.2 billion by 2020 (PMR, 2015). There are more than 200 approved biopharmaceuticals on the market today and many more in the clinical pipeline (Walsh, 2014). Currently, most biologics are produced in microbes or mammalian cells growing in fermenters. Microbes are simple and inexpensive but often fail to produce complex proteins or those requiring specific post-translational modifications, whereas mammalian cells can achieve these folding and modification tasks with aplomb but only at a much higher cost. Both systems also have the potential for undesirable contaminants-endotoxins in the case of bacteria, and viruses or other pathogens in the case of mammalian cells. The extra steps required during downstream processing to remove these contaminants can increase production costs even further (BOX 1). \n\nThe choice of expression hosts has more recently expanded to include plants because they offer unique features compared to the current dominant production systems (Stoger et al., 2014;Ma et al., 2015). The production of recombinant proteins in plants, where the protein itself is the BOX 1 | COMPARISON OF MAJOR PRODUCTION PLATFORMS Industry platforms for the production of recombinant proteins are based mainly on microbes and mammalian cells. The major microbial system is the bacterium Escherichia coli which was the first species used to produce a recombinant human protein (somatostatin in 1977(somatostatin in , Itakura et al., 1977) ) and the first to be used for the production of a commercial therapeutic protein (recombinant human insulin, approved in 1982 and marketed by Eli Lilly & Co. under license from Genentech). Many simple and unmodified proteins are produced commercially in E. coli but more complex proteins are difficult to fold unless targeted to the periplasm and this is not a scalable process (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004;Choi and Lee, 2004).",

            "text": "Proteins are essential components of life and constitute the majority of living organisms. They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

The main advantages of E. coli are rapid growth rate, capability to reach high cell densities, growth on inexpensive substrates, well-characterized genetics, and the availability of excellent tools for genetic manipulation ( Brown, 1995 ) . \n\nA wide range of expression systems with different features have been developed for recombinant protein production ( RPP ) in E. coli , comprising plasmids for constitutive or inducible expression, different mechanisms of induction ( e.g., temperature and IPTG-inducible systems ) , the use of strains with different genotypes ( Waegeman & Soetaert, 2011 ) , and additional features to aid production ( e.g., use of tuneable strains or co-expression of chaperones; Marschall et al., 2017 ) . Moreover, expression systems may incorporate fusion tags to increase protein solubility or enable purification using affinity chromatography ( Costa et al., 2014 ) . The vast majority of expression systems for lab-based investigations include antibiotic resistance markers that enable screening of positive clones and help in plasmid retention. However, the use of expression systems with antibiotic markers is considered unacceptable by regulatory authorities in relevant areas of industrial biotechnology ( e.g., medical, therapeutic, and agricultural applications; Glenting & Wessels, 2005 ) and follows current trends in improvements in antibiotic use and stewardship to reduce antimicrobial resistance ( Mignon et al., 2015 ) . \n\nIn order to produce high levels of protein, it is often useful to clone the gene of interest downstream to a well-characterized, strong, and tightly regulated promoter. The E. coli lac promoter is arguably the most extensively studied ( Germ\u00e1n et al., 2019 ) .",

            "text": "Yeasts are attractive hosts for recombinant protein expression due to their fast growth, high protein yield, simple handling, low production costs and industrial production knowledge, advantages that have in common with prokaryote systems. Moreover, they also possess some advantages of eukaryotes systems such as the capacity to perform posttranslational modification of proteins in a manner similar to that used by higher eukaryotic cells, allowing recombinant proteins to be more likely correctly folded [38]. All these advantages make yeast a cost-effective production system when compared to higher eukaryotic systems such as animal cells. Regarding safety, they also avoid the endotoxin problem that is associated with bacterial expression systems and viral contamination of mammalian expression systems [164]. Yeasts also face some challenges, as their glycosylation pattern is distinct from that carried out by mammalian cells, leading to hyperglycosylation (excess of mannose residues) of recombinant proteins. To change the high-mannose profile of yeast to the human-type complex glycan pattern, the glycosylation pathways have been genetically altered in some strains, such as S. cerevisiae [165,166], H. polymorpha and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) [167,168]. Moreover, yeasts are also being engineered to overexpress chaperones with the aim to enhance secretion and folding of recombinant proteins [169][170][171]. S. cerevisiae is the most extensively used yeast host for heterologous protein production and several vaccines have already been successfully produced in this system. Recombivax HB \u00ae (Merck & Co.) was the first recombinant vaccine approved for human use and is directed for treatment of hepatitis B, based on HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) that self-assembles into VLPs [91,92]. HBsAg was previously produced in E. coli but it was not immunogenic, which led to a search for a different expression host [172][173][174].",

Some microbial hosts, such as E. coli and yeast, have been reported to be utilized for the production of recombinant SODs [34,35]. However, B. subtilis, as another widely applied host for recombinant protein expression, has not yet been used. Indeed, using B. subtilis strains as hosts could further lower the cost of SOD production since they could achieve robust growth with crude and low-cost materials in the fermentation medium, such as those used in this study. Once this protocol is scaled up, the unit material cost could remain stable, while the unit energy consumption would be further reduced, since the widely approved fact that larger bioreactors provide lower unit energy consumptions. However, challenges are still need to be faced for production of AaSOD in an industrial scale. For examples, the high oxygen consumption of B. subtilis during robust growth need to be satisfied by the bioreactors, and the loss of SOD activity might be amplified when an industrial-scale spray dryer is applied since it is operated at higher temperature and longer period.",

            "text": "The relevance of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli for the basic biotechnological research as well as for industrial exploitation is outstanding. E. coli served as the primary model organism within the development of modern biotechnology. As a consequence, researchers today have access to a broad spectrum of genetic tools and cultivation techniques, enabling simple and predictable genetic manipulation and cultivation on inexpensive media to high cell densities. As regards industrial exploitation, E. coli emerged as the primary production workhorse for the biotechnological production of primary and secondary metabolites as well as recombinant proteins. This is reflected by the fact that 29 % of all biopharmaceutical products approved as biopharmaceuticals between 2010 and July 2014 are produced in E. coli (Walsh 2014). \n\nOverall productivity and product quality obtained from E. coli processes is determined by the complex interplay of processing mode and the product to be produced as well as the expression system applied. \n\nThe main challenges of recombinant protein production in E. coli are associated with non-suitable (too high or too low) level of recombinant expression: \n\n1. First, high-level expression and the presence of foreign plasmids drain the hosts' metabolic resources (often referred to as metabolic load or metabolic burden) (Bentley et al. 2009;Bienick et al. 2014;Glick 1995;Mairhofer et al. 2013). Metabolic load often resulting in depletion of amino acids or aminoacyl-tRNAs and triggering heatshock response can therefore ultimately affect product quality-related issues (specific activity, stability, and immunogenicity) and product quantity-related issues (product degradation, lower specific product yields, lower biomass yields, or shorter culture stability). 2. Second, high-level expression of recombinant products can lead to the formation of unfolded or partially folded insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies which show no catalytic function or activity (Baig et al. 2014;Kane and Hartley 1991). 3. Third, the production of many recombinant products, especially proteins containing disulfide bridges, demands translocation between compartments of the E. coli cell factory (Baneyx and Mujacic 2004).",

Protein isolation, especially from plant sources, can be costly, cumbersome and lengthy, and heterologous expression provides a convenient alternative. This methodology allows large-scale production of plant proteins in microorganisms to study their biochemical and biophysical features. Foreign hosts may also provide a simpler system for studies on functions of proteins and for elucidation of their roles in complex mechanisms such as metabolic reactions and membrane transport. Recombinant plant proteins and peptides produced by heterologous expression are also used in industrial applications. Examples are provided by the synthesis of a medicinal peptide from ginseng as potential drug against diabetes [1] or production of plant lectins [2] in both cases in yeast.\n\nThe present review covers the recent literature on plant gene expression in bacteria, yeast, insect cells and Xenopus oocytes and presents the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each system. It also provides a survey of recent examples of application of heterologous expression technology to plant proteins. A comprehensive list of plant proteins expressed heterologously is given in Table 1. Factors influencing the choice of hosts, including the stability and folding characteristics of the protein, requirement for posttranslational modifications, efficiency of the expression system, as well as simplicity and cost are discussed in the following sections.",

            "text": "Currently the most commonly used bacterial host for industrial production of heterologous proteins is Escherichia coli. Advantages of its use as a production host for proteins are that it can be grown easily in large fermentations, and that it is genetically amenable and able to produce large quantities of proteins. However, in E. coli the produced proteins usually accumulate within the cells where they have a high potential to aggregate, resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. To acquire the protein, the inclusion bodies need to be separated from the cell and the proteins subsequently need to be recovered from the inclusion bodies. Moreover, the outer membrane of E. coli, and of Gram-negative bacteria in general, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS or endotoxin), which is highly pyrogenic and needs to be totally removed before the produced proteins can be used for clinical purposes. \n\nB. subtilis has excellent fermentation capacities that are equal to, if not better, than those of E. coli. In addition, B. subtilis is also capable of producing large quantities of proteins. However, in contrast to E. coli, B. subtilis lacks an outer membrane and is able to secrete proteins directly into the medium. Therefore, the secreted proteins can be purified easily from the medium in their active form, which simplifies the downstream processing considerably. Although most of the proteins that are commercially produced by B. subtilis are secreted into the medium, there are also successful examples of cytoplasmic protein production in B. subtilis [15]. Like all living organisms, B. subtilis has cellular quality control systems. These facilitate the production of high quality proteins, and remove misfolded and incompletely synthesized proteins [16,17]. Unfortunately, cellular quality control systems also represent significant bottlenecks in heterologous protein production [18,19]. This poses a fascinating challenge for cell factory engineering since inactivation of quality control systems can improve protein production yields, but these improved yields might be at the expense of product quality. Clearly, a reduced product quality would be an unwanted effect, especially if the product is a biopharmaceutical.",

            "text": "E. coli is by far the most used prokaryotic microorganism for recombinant production of lipases, followed by the Gram-positive soil bacterium B. subtilis. Hence, according to Borrelli and Trono [42], E. coli represents 50% of the total heterologous production of lipases by eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts. This dominant position in the production hierarchy has been earned by the more than 40 years of intensive use as production host and the even longer record of serving as one of the most important biological model organisms. As a result, E. coli is likely the best understood organism on the planet with a superior genetic toolbox and profound insights into its genetics and physiology. Together, these advantages have been used to construct highly efficient E. coli based cell factories for heterologous protein production, and there are examples where the new protein constitutes 30% of the total intracellular content of proteins. Moreover, E. coli based processes are typically easy to manipulate and scale-up due to consolidated methodologies of fermentation, cloning and expression with different strains, protocols and studies available. Many strategies are available to optimize a production process. For example, in the context of recombinant lipases, purification can be simplified by fusing the lipase gene to sequences encoding signal peptides (PelB and OmpA) as they will direct the proteins to the periplasmic space. Moreover, yields of soluble protein may be increased by co-expression with chaperones (GroES, GroEL and ClpB). In the first case, the enzyme could be recovered by ultrasonication or other cell lysis processes. The co-expression with chaperones enables the correct folding of the lipase, increases its solubility and decreases protein aggregation. Molecular chaperones are included in a family of unrelated classes of protein that mediate the correct assembly of other polypeptides-i.e., correct folding [66]. \n\nThe major limitations of using E. coli as an expression host include its inability to secrete large amounts of proteins or to perform post-translational modifications (PTMs)-i.e., protein glycosylation.",

            "text": "The possibility to heterologously express and purify specific recombinant proteins in large amounts permits their biochemical characterisation, the development of commercial goods and their use in industrial processes. With the development of recombinant insulin and its production in Escherichia coli in the 1980s [1], a multi-billion dollar market was launched, leading to current large-scale applications that are nowadays capable of releasing products ranging from protein biologics to industrial enzymes [2]. Ideally, the practical steps that lead to recombinant protein production are pretty straightforward and include the identification of the gene of interest, its cloning into an expression vector, its transformation into the host of choice, the induction of protein synthesis and its final purification and characterisation [3]. The intrinsic complexity of biological systems, however, usually poses problems down the pipeline of bacterial heterologous protein production. Indeed, as a consequence of the induction of the production of the foreign protein, the biochemistry and physiology of the host may be dramatically altered. The numerous physiological changes that may occur often lower the amount of the target foreign protein that is produced and eventually recovered from the recombinant organism [4]. In bacteria, high levels of recombinant protein production frequently lead to an impact on host cell metabolism; this is usually detectable through growth retardation and is generally known as 'metabolic burden' [5]. This additional metabolic load on the microbial chassis has been defined as the portion of a host cell's resources-either in the form of energy, such as ATP or GTP, or raw materials, such as amino acids-that is required to maintain and express foreign DNA, as either RNA or protein, in the cell [4]. In E. coli, for example, the overexpression of an unnecessary protein results in a linear decrease in the growth rate, with the zero-growth limit occurring when the overexpressed protein occupies a mass fraction equal to 1-\u03c6 f ixed , with \u03c6 f ixed representing the growth-rate invariant fraction of the proteome [6]. There are many factors contributing to the emergence of this burden on growing cells that, at the same time, express a heterologous protein. These mainly include the transcription, translation and folding of the foreign protein [5,",

            "text": "Recombinant or heterologous protein production (RPP) is an important biotechnological process, with applications that range from catalysis (e.g. washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g. antibody production), to protein production for enzymatic characterization and crystallography. Production of human proteins in bacteria dates back to the production of the 14-codon somatostatin gene in Escherichia coli in 1977 [1]. Since then, several hosts have been explored, including other prokaryote species [2], various yeast and fungal species [3], plant, insect, and mammalian cell lines [4]. As there is no universally optimal host, the choice of host is based on various parameters (protein yield, production time, etc.) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOne of the most critical parameters, especially for proteins of therapeutic interest, is the presence of post-translational modifications. Complex proteins might harbor disulfide bonds as well as complex glycan structures (e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments) that influence the 3D structure, serum stability and the protein effector functions [5]. However, in the case of E. coli, many engineered strains and expression platforms were made available over the years [6], including strains that enable some complex posttranslational modifications [7]. These advances, together with its easy cultivation, fast growth, and well-studied physiology explain E. coli 's role as a major host for RPP, including sensitive applications such as therapeutic protein production [8].\n\nOver-expression of recombinant proteins can lead to significant stress in the host cell, which in turn limits its capacity to function as a cell factory. First, it constitutes a general metabolic burden, as it is responsible for depletion of precursor metabolites [9]. Recombinant proteins are usually produced in very high amounts (it is not unusual to comprise 30% or more of total cellular protein in the cell), which leads to a significant stress for the cell. The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many rec",

            "text": "In 2005, there were 4,200 biotechnology companies worldwide. Total revenue amounted to $63 billion. Recombinant DNA technology has been remarkably advanced by their development of efficient and scale-up expression systems to produce enzymes from industrially-unknown microorganisms and other living organisms using industrial organisms such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and other species of Bacillus, Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Saccharomyce cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, and species of Aspergillus and Trichoderma [87]. Approximately 90% of industrial enzymes are recombinant versions. \n\nE. coli has been extensively used as a recombinant host for many reasons including (i) ease of quickly and precisely modifying the genome; (ii) rapid growth to high cell densities; (iii) ease of culture in cheap media; and (iv) ease of reduction of protease activity. E. coli can accumulate heterologous proteins up to 50% of its dry cell weight [88]. However, it has several drawbacks, such as: inability for post-translational modifications, presence of toxic cell wall pyrogens or, sometimes, formation of inclusion bodies containing inactive, aggregated and insoluble heterologous protein. \n\nDespite this, high level production and excretion has been obtained with the following heterologous proteins: alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) at 5.2 g/L into the periplasm, and levan fructotransferase LFT at 4 g/L into the medium. In 1993, recombinant processes in E. coli were responsible for almost $5 billion worth of products (87). R. eutropha produced organophosphohydrolase at 10 g/L [89]. The P. fluorescens culture of the Pfenex company is capable of producing 20 g/L of protein [90]. \n\nS. cerevisiae offers certain advantages over bacteria as a cloning host [91].",

            "text": "Cellular energy conservation and utilisation efficiency often imply that enzyme syntheses have feedback mechanisms and various other factors that prevent excessive production of all metabolites, including enzymes. Moreover, some organisms that are capable of enzyme over-expression may not necessarily be amenable to manageable growth conditions in the laboratory. Sometimes, the feasible solution to these challenges is the application of recombinant technology, involving the modification of a more amenable organism by integrating DNA molecules of the desired traits to allow its over-expression in the host organism, achieved through the use of a vector [155]. Since the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, it has contributed greatly to the large-scale production of many important proteins, including enzymes, in fields ranging from agriculture to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics [156,157]. Over the years, different expression hosts have been developed for recombinant protein production. In their work, Tripathi and Shrivastava [158] review these expression hosts, including bacteria, mammalian cells, yeasts, insects, and transgenic plants. The authors also point out the importance of using eukaryotic hosts to produce therapeutic proteins, as these require post-translational modifications, especially glycosylation, for their efficacy. As previously discussed, PTMs play a crucial role in eukaryotic protein stability, solubility, and functionality. As such, PTMs must therefore be considered during the selection of the host for recombinant protein production. Von Schaewen et al. [159] further explain this attribute as they discuss the limitations of bacterial hosts such as E. coli for the production of recombinant eukaryotic proteins. \n\nBesides host selection, recombinant protein production also relies greatly on the effectiveness of cloning. The expression of recombinant eukaryotic proteins involves cloning of the cDNA of interest into an appropriate expression vector, followed by its insertion into the host cell [156]. Several cloning vectors are available depending on the intended use. Various cloning methods have also been developed. Jia and Jeon [160] describe different cloning methods and their possible applications for high-throughput recombinant protein production.",

In recent years, the chemical and structural diversity of protein products has expanded rapidly, with targets such as short anti-microbial peptides [5], antibody-like binding proteins for diagnostics [6], and protein biomaterials [7,8]. These vast differences in physicochemical properties call for a variety of strategies to ensure that production of heterologous proteins is robust and scalable. \n\nSecreting protein to the extracellular space increases initial purity and thus can decrease the complexity of downstream processing. Eukaryotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or HEK 293 cells secrete recombinant proteins through their native secretion machinery at high titers [9][10][11][12]. Mammalian cells, however, are slow growing, expensive to culture, have large batch to batch variations, and can be difficult to genetically engineer [10,13]. Yeasts typically are faster growing but can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation [14]. \n\nBacterial hosts offer fast growth, relative genetic simplicity, and genetic stability [15]. Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans allow protein secretion directly to the extracellular medium through the general secretory pathway, as they lack an outer membrane (OM). Secretion stress response systems and folding chaperones provide extracellular quality control. B. subtilis has a high secretion capacity-titers on the order of grams per liter have been achieved [16][17][18]. Compatibility with heterologous proteins is largely limited to enzymes, however, and extracellular proteolytic degradation is a significant product quality issue [19]. S. lividans has low extracellular protease activity while retaining a high secretion capacity.",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA technology is one of the pillars that have supported the progress of Biotechnology during the past 50 years. Recombinant structural proteins and enzymes have direct applications as biopharmaceuticals (hormones, cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, etc.) and in technological processes that are central to industrial fields such as food and feed, detergents, textile, paper, waste management, organic synthesis and biofuels (Kirk et al., 2002;Overton, 2014;Puetz and Wurm, 2019). The production of recombinant proteins is an expanding industry with increasing economic significance. Reports have estimated that the value for the global enzymes market in 2021 exceeded $6 billion, and a steady growth projection is forecast for the following years, at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%-6.8% between 2019 and 2027 (Sutay Kocabas and Grumet, 2019;BlueWeave Consulting and Research Pvt Ltd, 2021;de la Fuente et al., 2021;Espina et al., 2021;Mesbah, 2022). Concerning biopharmaceuticals, as of 2018, more than 300 protein-based drugs had been approved in Europe and United States, and almost a third of all pharmaceuticals in development were protein-based (Walsh, 2018). The market of protein-based biopharmaceuticals has only continued to grow, with numerous new drugs being approved each year (Martins et al., 2022), and global sales reaching $90.53 billion in 2020 (Sanchez-Trasvi\u00f1a et al., 2021). \n\nObtaining these highly profitable recombinant proteinbased products requires an expression platform. The range of available hosts for recombinant protein production (RPP) is extensive, including eukaryotic organisms, such as filamentous fungi, yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants, transgenic animals and insect cells, as well as prokaryotic hosts (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019). Among the latter, Escherichia coli is to this date the most widely used host for RPP (Terpe, 2006;Kaur et al., 2018;Lozano Terol et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Given the global prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, endolysins are considered as an attractive therapeutic option in clinical settings. Although endolysins show many advantages in the treatment of drug-resistant bacteria (Table 2), some challenges remain, and further research must be performed to consider their large-scale production, engineering, and drug delivery toward widespread utilization. The large-scale production of phage endolysins has attracted great attention. However, the two main challenges that need to be solved are manufacturing cost and safety. Escherichia coli is the most common organism for the production of recombinant proteins, as this expression platform is well-established, and the cellular and molecular tools needed in the process of protein expression from gene cloning to protein purification are widely accessible [156,157]. In general, S. aureus recombinant endolysins are expressed in E. coli [157]. However, some functional recombinant proteins are unavailable due to protein toxicity to the host or aggregation in inclusion bodies, even if numerous studies have attempted to optimize the E. coli expression system in the aspects of host engineering, expression vector design, and culture optimization [156]. Alternatively, the Pichia pastoris expression system has high recombinant protein yields; even some filamentous fungi or other systems can be considered for the production of recombinant endolysins [157,158]. For example, the endolysins Cpl-1 and Pal, which are specific against S. pneumoniae, can be successfully expressed in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; this host has many advantages, such as the lack of endotoxins, no infectious potential, and low production costs [159]. Moreover, a platform for expressing an endolysin against Cutibacterium acnes in cyanobacteria can reduce production costs and avoid toxicity issues caused by toxic bacterial components such as endotoxin [157]. \n\nFurthermore, new strategies are needed to develop novel and suitable endolysins that possess enhanced bactericidal activity; expanded lytic spectrum; and increased solubility, stability, and circulating half-life.",

            "text": "Prokaryotic hosts Among the various systems for producing heterologous proteins, E. coli, a Gramnegative bacterium, continues to be one of the most attractive hosts. Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI. These factors play a crucial role in optimizing the production and guaranteeing increased production of the recombinant immunotoxin.",

            "text": "Although various host cells described in the literature can serve as expression systems for recombinant protein production, almost all diagnostic RMP studies to date have used E. coli as the expression system of choice  (Tables 1-5).What makes this host so well-suited for this purpose?This expression system boasts a long history and offers several well-established advantages, including ease of manipulation, low-cost culture, and rapid growth kinetics.The doubling time of 20 min facilitates the achievement of high cell density cultures, with a theoretical concentration limit of ~ 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [26,130].Furthermore, E. coli stands out as the most cost-effective host, allowing for the attainment of high cellular densities with inexpensive culture media.Additionally, well-developed tools for molecular manipulations, coupled with in-depth knowledge of its biology [131], contribute to the versatility of bacterium as a protein expression host.The E. coli cultivation process involves growing the bacteria in a culture medium, with selection antibiotics, until reaching an optical density 600 (OD) 600 between 0.6 and 0.8, a mid-log phase indicative.For that, the most widely used media are Luria-Bertani, Terrific Broth, and Super Broth, based on mixtures of tryptone/ peptone and yeast extract in a saline solution, which can either be sodium chloride or sodium phosphate.To optimize growth, the bacterial culture must be kept at a temperature and rotation of 37 \u00b0C and 150-200 revolutions per minute (rpm).Upon reaching the desired absorbance, the inducer molecule must be added to the culture medium, typically the allolactose analog isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranose (IPTG), to start recombinant gene transcription.More details of this approach are well provided by Sambrook et al. (1989) [132].\n\nThe first E. coli isolate was deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, UK) in 1920.Later on, Cohen et al. (1973) made a groundbreaking discovery of recombinant DNA technology, which marked a pivotal moment in the biotechnology field five decades ago [133].",

            "text": "of AQPs in the near future, as suggested by high resolution spectra obtained for hAQP1 [22]. Recombinant AQP proteins are commonly expressed from several host organisms, including the bacterial E. coli [23], mammalian insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 [24], yeast Pichia pastoris [25], and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [26]. Typically, a target AQP encoded by a host expression vector will be expressed in fusion with an affinity tag, commonly a polyhistidine (6His) tag. Once this recombinant AQP is produced from host cells, host lysis is closely followed by reconstitution of the recombinant AQP from host cell membranes into stabilizing biomimetic environments, i.e., detergent micelles. This will provide a suitable environment for downstream affinity purification of the recombinant AQP using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography.\n\nThe addition of recombinant fusion partners such as the maltose binding protein (MBP), and the optimization of codon usage has been shown to boost production levels of AqpZ to 200 mg/L of E. coli culture [27]. Similarly, protein yields of human AQPs expressed from P. pastoris can also be improved by codon optimization and clone selection [28]. In addition, high production of AQP proteins is also possible using cell-free (CF) expression system, a novel approach which mimics the natural cell cytoplasmic environment for protein synthesis. This holds advantages over traditional in vivo membrane protein expression in living cells, such as elimination of toxicity to host cell physiology due to membrane incorporation of recombinant proteins, and overloading of essential cellular protein-targeting machineries in order to overexpress a foreign protein [29]. CF extracts can be obtained from E. coli cells, wheat germs, rabbit reticulocytes, insect cells, and more recently, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [30]. In the CF system, newly synthesized AQP proteins can be incorporated directly into artificial hydrophobic environments, like detergent micelles [31]",

The growth disadvantage favors faster\u2010growing non\u2010producer mutants. Therefore, continuous bioprocessing is hardly feasible in Escherichia coli due to the high escape rate. The stability of E. coli expression systems under long\u2010term production conditions and how metabolic load triggered by recombinant gene expression influences the characteristics of mutations are investigated. Iterated fed\u2010batch\u2010like microbioreactor cultivations are conducted under production conditions. The easy\u2010to\u2010produce green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a challenging antigen\u2010binding fragment (Fab) are used as model proteins, and BL21(DE3) and BL21Q strains as expression hosts.

A T7 RNA polymerase expression system is only conditionally suitable for long\u2010term cultivation under production conditions. Mutations leading to non\u2010producers occur in either the T7 RNA polymerase gene or the T7 promoter. The host RNA polymerase\u2010based BL21Q expression system remains stable in the production of GFP in long\u2010term cultivations. For the production of Fab, mutations in lacI of the BL21Q derivatives have positive effects on long\u2010term stability.

            "text": "With the advent of genetic engineering technologies, many proteins have been experimentally expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with high efficiency. Because of its short life cycle, easy genetic manipulation, and simple culture conditions, E. coli is a preferable host to produce many recombinant proteins [5,6]. E. coli was the first host utilized by Eli Lilly in 1982 to produce recombinant insulin [7]. Although all bacteria could be used for recombinant protein technologies, E. coli is still the preferable host for the industrial production of recombinant proteins [8]. For cloning purposes in E. coli species, researchers are faced with two main obstacles: solubility of recombinant proteins for high expression and low and complicated expression of a foreign gene. Accordingly, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus strain is a good host for large-scale protein expression. The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been tremendous expansion in the variety of products and processes available for the manufacture and purification of recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are increasingly being used in industrial settings and academic research, and for medicinal and diagnostic purposes [21,22]. For diagnostic purposes, one of the components of the TB diagnostic kit that we devised was independently made in order to support the national independence of medical devices. In this study, we produced the MPT64 target protein by over-expressing the synthetic MPT64-encoding gene in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The most often utilized host microbe in biotechnology is Escherichia coli. E. coli can be used to produce heterologous proteins because of a number of benefits. Despite these benefits, making recombinant proteins in E. coli has certain drawbacks, such as the development of inclusion bodies, ineffective protein translocation, and metabolic cost [21]. Bacterial growth is a complicated process that involves metabolite synthesis (anabolic) and the breakdown (catabolic) of various cell components [22]. The MPT64 protein used in this investigation was produced as a recombinant protein without a tag for protein purification. Thus, the pelB signaling peptide was fused to this MPT64 protein to be released into the medium. In our earlier investigation, the MPT64 protein was translocated across the host cell membrane of E. coli by using pelB as a signal peptide [23]. Another study that utilized the same signal peptide and cell host reported the effectiveness of pelB in releasing protein into a medium [24]. Nevertheless, the yield of the MPT64 protein extracellular recovery was still poor in our prior investigation, and a large amount of this protein remained trapped in the cytoplasm and periplasm [23]. In accordance with this, it has been extensively documented that the periplasm is always where the challenge of expressing extracellular proteins in E. coli is located [25].",

            "text": "The market for recombinant pharmaceutical proteins is expanding rapidly. Indeed, nearly all pharmaceutical companies with a market capitalization value of more than $US 10 billion report that their revenue share from such products is growing faster than the share from small-molecule drugs [1]. The industry has focused on a small number of production platforms based on the bacterium Escherichia coli, several species of yeast, and a selection of insect and mammalian cell lines, which have been developed and improved in line with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). However, focusing on a small number of platforms means that the unique requirements of certain target proteins are difficult to meet; this is the case of recombinant proteins that are required in small quantities (e.g., for individual patients) or in massive quantities or that need rapid production scale-up. Plant biotechnology can overcome some of these limitations and the potential of plant-based platforms for the flexible, low-cost production of high-quality, bioactive recombinant proteins is well-documented [2]. \n\nPlants successfully perform the majority of posttranslational modifications required for the activity of complex eukaryotic proteins and provide tremendous flexibility in terms of scale, cost, safety, and regulatory issues. For example, cell-based bioreactor systems including plant suspension cells and algae are ideal for lower-volume products, whereas field-grown commodity crops can produce metric tons of recombinant protein at highly competitive costs. Contained production systems based on plants have biosafety advantages over microbial and mammalian production platforms because they neither do produce endotoxins nor do they support the growth of pathogens that infect animals, thus reducing purification costs and minimizing the likelihood of facility shutdowns, decontamination issues, and supply limitations that lead to unmet patient/customer demands. Although the costs of downstream processing and purification are comparable in microbial, mammalian, and plantbased platforms, the lower up-front investment required for commercial production in plants and the potential economy of scale provided by cultivation over large areas are key advantages. \n\nThis combination of low capital investment, low-cost of goods, and highly scalable manufacturing means that many proteins that are unsuitable for production in fermenters can be produced commercially using plants.",

            "text": "Plants have accompanied humans throughout their historical development, and their role in human life can hardly be overestimated. Plants are not only \"the lungs\" of our planet and the most important source of food, energy, and raw materials in everyday life but also the source of manifold valuable therapeutic compounds traditionally used by humankind for the management of various maladies and diseases. The current relevance of plants is additionally emphasized by their utility as alternative expression systems for bulk production of recombinant proteins, including those for medical purposes. Thus, we cannot but admit that the resolution of such global challenges as the food, energy, ecological, and drug security is unfeasible without broad application of plants in the already existing areas of biotechnology as producers of a long list of biologically active compounds. \n\nCurrently, a large number of pharmaceutically valuable proteins are synthesized as recombinant analogs in different expression systems (Escherichia coli, yeasts, and animal cells) rather than extracted from natural sources. This makes it possible to manufacture on a commercial scale the proteins unobtainable by traditional extraction methods (for example, insulin or human growth hormone). It should be underscored that approximately 80% of recombinant pharmaceutically valuable proteins are synthesized in mammalian cell cultures [1]. Although this expression system is prevalent in the manufacture of Plants 2023, 12, 38 2 of 31 recombinant proteins, it has its own shortcomings associated with the risk of contamination with pathogens, expensiveness, formation of side products, and other problems. \n\nPlant expression systems are the most attractive for researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Advantages of plant expression systems consist of relatively inexpensive cultivation; the absence of undesirable components, such as bacterial endotoxins or hyperglycosylated target proteins, produced by yeasts; and, in contrast to animal cell cultures, the absence of animal and human pathogens. Plant cells enable correct folding and formation of intricate multimeric protein complexes as well as most of the post-translational modifications of target proteins necessary for their biological activity [2]. Plant cells are able to synthesize complex mammalian proteins, such as collagens, hemoglobin, and immunoglobulins.",

            "text": "The Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis and related species are widely used as hosts for the extracellular production of industrially worthy enzymes, such as amylases, proteases, xylanase, and lipases (Braun et al., 1999;Tjalsma et al., 2000;Westers et al., 2004). These species possess a very high capacity for secreting a variety of exoenzymes into the growth medium, thereby reducing downstream purification processes. In addition, many of these are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) microorganisms, and do not produce endotoxins. Therefore, the secretion system of these species presents many advantages in terms of production capacity, structural authenticity, product purification, and safety. Nevertheless, the secretion of heterologous proteins from eukaryotes by these species is frequently inefficient (Table1). Hence, these species are never selected as the best cell factory for pharmaceutical proteins (Westers et al., 2004). \n\nIn pharmaceutical industry, the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is well established. In many cases, proteins are produced in cytoplasm of E. coli, and therefore, the production of recombinant proteins involves refolding and purification from inclusion bodies. However, the production of soluble recombinant proteins is relatively more costeffective and less time-consuming. In fact, many studies have been performed regarding methods to overcome the problem of inclusion bodies and to improve protein solubility for the expression of heterologous proteins (Kapust & Waugh, 1999;Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004;S\u00f8rensen & Mortensen, 2005;Rabhi-Essafi et al., 2007). Therefore, developing human protein producing hosts is a major challenge in the field of biotechnology and protein production in Bacilli. \n\nIn B. subtilis, one long-standing major problem is the presence of high levels of extracellular protease for the production of heterologous proteins.",

The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are commonly expressed in bacterial expression systems, which have some advantages, such as quick growth, low cost, and high yield ( Terpe, 2006 ) . Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used expression hosts for the production of recombinant proteins ( Choi & Lee, 2004 ;Duzenli & Okay, 2020 ) . However, there are several problems regarding the production and secretion of recombinant proteins in E. coli ( Selleck & Tan, 2008 ;Wong et al., 2003 ) . Escherichia coli does not have an efficient secretion mechanism for extracellular proteins ( Liu et al., 2013 ) . Most recombinant proteins cannot be directly secreted to outside of cells, except for toxins and other special proteins ( Yang et al., 2019 a ) . The extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins can avoid hydrolysis from intracellular proteases, simplifying their isolation and purification ( Jong et al., 2010 ) , and enhance their folding in the periplasm as well as their intrinsic biological activity ( Choi & Lee, 2004 ;Jong et al., 2010 ) . Gram-negative bacteria have some secretion pathways ( e.g., type I and type II ) , which can transport proteins across cell membranes ( Henderson et al., 2000 ;Koster et al., 2000 ;Saier, 2006 ) . Recombinant proteins usually cannot be efficiently secreted using signal peptides because of inefficient export systems, protein special characters, and reduced outer membrane autolytic activity ( Freudl, 2018 ) . Meanwhile, sequences of signal peptides, target proteins, and hosts can affect the efficiency of protein secretion ( Ni & Chen, 2009 ) . Extracellular secretion levels of proteins in E. coli can be improved by adding chemicals ( e.g., Triton ) to destroy cell membrane integrity ( Choi & Lee, 2004 ;Duan et al., 2015 ;Zou et al., 2014 ) . \n\nPeptidoglycan is the foremost skeleton that forms the cell wall of E. coli , the disturbance of the synthesis and stability of which can improve cell membrane permeability ( Popham & Young, 2003 ;Scheffers & Pinho, 2005 ) .",

            "text": "However, E. coli also presents disadvantages with respect to recombinant protein production: normally, the protein is not secreted by the cell, which often makes downstream processing more complex and expensive; the recombinant protein may aggregate and form insoluble particles called inclusion bodies, in which the protein is inactive; disulfide bonds may not form as intended, leading to protein denaturation and often to the formation of inclusion bodies; the cell machinery may stall or truncate proteins owing to codon bias, leading to low expression or loss of function; E. coli is not capable of performing post-translational modifications such as glycosylation; and the lipopolysaccharides that constitute the outer membrane of E. coli elicit strong immune responses in humans and other mammals [17][18][19][20][21]. The last four issues are usually more relevant when producing eukaryotic proteins for human or animal use, but these issues do not preclude E. coli from accounting for one-third of the recombinant proteins approved by the FDA for therapeutic purposes [23,25]. \n\nConsidering the aforementioned advantages, disadvantages, and knowledge gaps associated with E. coli recombinant protein processes, the aim of this work was to model, simulate, and economically assess the production in E. coli of a low-value-added recombinant protein, \u03b2-glucosidase, to be used as a supplementary enzyme in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Process parameters that are known to be significant, such as the process scale, biomass productivity, and recombinant protein-specific productivity, were evaluated. Furthermore, process characteristics that are rarely emphasized in the literature, such as the seed train expansion factor, bioreactor material, and cost contributions of the inducer and antibiotic compounds, were also examined, thereby contributing to a better understanding of the factors that affect the technical and economic feasibility of such processes.",

            "text": "Cells are surrounded by complex envelopes that control the exchange of metabolites, catabolites, energy and signals with the environment [1,2]. For this manifold requirements, they rely on membrane integrated proteins that differ in structure and function. Up to 30% of all genes in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes encode such membrane proteins [3] and their malfunction often causes serious diseases like diabetes or cystic fibrosis [4,5]. To gain insight into the structure and function of membrane proteins, it is crucial to purify them in sufficient amounts and in a properly folded state [6]. As they are usually not sufficiently abundant in the native cell membrane, numerous expression systems for the recombinant production of membrane proteins have been established. They differ in the host organism used, the transcriptional regulation or the post-translational modifications of the proteins [7,8]. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, studies on membrane proteins are challenging and in many cases already their production fails. \n\nEscherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic host for the recombinant production of membrane protein. The organism is comprehensively characterized and can be cultivated in a cost efficient manner. Growth in rich and minimal media to high cell densities is possible over a wide range of temperatures within the course of 1 day. Escherichia coli's genome was sequenced in 1997 [9] facilitating the directed design of specialized strains for protein production [10,11]. Genetic tools to create gene deletion or insertion mutants are available and transient gene expression is enabled by the availability of a large number of vectors and promoters [12]. Taken together, E. coli is part of the most advanced prokaryotic production systems available but still membrane protein production is a bottleneck in many studies. Different Bacillus species, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Lactococcus lactis and several further species are successfully used for the commercial production of predominantly soluble proteins [7], but only L. lactis is frequently used as an alternative host for the production of membrane proteins [13]. As a Gram-positive bacterium it differs from E. coli in several aspects, e.g.",

            "text": "BackgroundThe Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has been widely used as a cell factory for the production of proteins and specialty chemicals because it is the best characterized host with many available expression and regulation systems. However, recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli are generally intracellular and often found in the form of inclusion bodies. Extracellular production of proteins is advantageous compared with intracellular production because extracellular proteins can be purified more easily and can avoid protease attack, which results in higher product quality. In this study, we found a catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) and its N-terminus can be employed as carriers for extracellular production of recombinant proteins.ResultsIn this report, we identified the catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) from Bacillus sp. that can be secreted into the medium from recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) in large quantities without its native signal peptide. By subcellular location analysis, we proved that the secretion was a two-step process and the N-terminal sequence of the full length Cel-CD played a crucial function in secretion. Both the Cel-CD and its N-terminal sequence can serve as carriers for efficient extracellular production of select target proteins.ConclusionsFusion of heterologous proteins with N20 from Cel-CD can carry the target proteins out of the cells with a concentration from 101 to 691\u00a0mg/L in flask cultivation. The extracellular recombinant proteins with a relative high purity. The results suggested that this system has a potential application in plant biomass conversion and industrial production of enzymes and therapeutic proteins.",

Each of these hosts was characterized by several advantages and disadvantages ( Table 2).\n\nAs shown in Table 2, high production yields can be achieved in yeast and E. coli. However, yeast has the tendency of hyperglycosylating recombinant glycoproteins, which impedes subsequent downstream processing and limits enzyme applications [26,35]. This strongly argues for the recombinant production in E. coli. Furthermore, up to 20-fold higher space-time-yields can be achieved in E. coli compared to the yeast P. pastoris (own unpublished data for HRP isoenzyme C1A). However, the presence of disulfide bonds and the heme group in the active site of peroxidase-catalases causes the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs) rather than active enzyme. The alternative expression in the periplasm of E. coli only gives low yields [30,38,39], which is why the production of this enzyme family as IBs, followed by refolding, is inevitable.",

The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Despite this, it must be noted that adapting large-scale production processes to the biological complexity of some of these systems might represent, in some cases, an unaffordable task.\n\nFrom a different angle, bacterial hosts others than E. coli are attracting attention as cell factories due to their metabolic diversity and biosynthetic potential derived from adaptation to extremely diverse environments. The most important bacterial groups explored as cell factories for recombinant proteins and their associated potentialities are summarized in Table 1. The implementation of lactic acid bacteria as a routine cell factory expands their applications from conventional food microbiology [18-21] to protein production and also protein drug display and delivery [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29], taking advantage of the generically recognized as safe (GRAS) features of this platform. Improved solubility in halophillic and cold-adapted bacteria, enhanced secretion in acid lactic bacteria and in general in endotoxin-free gram-positive species and post-translational modifications in mycobacteria among others are highly appealing properties in protein production, that can be of special value for specific difficult-to-express proteins. While exhibiting most of the above mentioned limitations linked to prokaryotic-based production, exploring bacterial species other than E. coli should be not abandoned but fully supported as it will not only expand the current catalogue of cell factories but also offer novel process opportunities in easily cultivable/scalable systems that might pose, in generic terms, less methodological issues than unconventional protein production systems [30].\n\nTowards a progressively more competitive biological synthesis by microbes [78] and assisted by expanding systems metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools [79], industrial biotechnology should desirably find within the prokaryotic world, a growing spectrum of alternatives to eukaryotic cell factories, that",

The technology proves to be advantageous not just regarding reduced time and wellestablished protocols, but also reduced production costs and easy scale up. Genes expressing the target protein/peptide of interest are cloned into specific vectors for expression in host cellular expression systems. Bacteria and yeast are the most widely used host systems for the expression of recombinant products [11]. In case of AMPs as well, these two expression hosts have been reported to produce more than 95% of the heterologously expressed AMPs [12]. Among bacteria selected for AMP expression, E. coli, particularly strain E. coli BL2l (DE3) has been most popularly used. The choice of E. coli as a suitable host is attributed to its faster growth rate, higher yields, established expression protocols, large commercial availability of expression vectors and cost-effectiveness. Other bacterial systems such as B. subtilis have also been used as hosts for expression of AMPs, but not to the same extent as E. coli. Among yeast, Pichia pastoris has been employed as a potential host. Table 1 shows several AMPs produced recombinantly from engineered microorganisms in the recent years [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. \n\nIt becomes clear that AMPs from numerous and different sources have further been expressed recombinantly. Interestingly, the target AMP in most cases is expressed as a fusion protein (i.e., in combination with a carrier protein) and later cleaved from the same [33]. This is primarily to avoid the toxicity of the AMP to the host strain. Carrier proteins have specific anionic properties, which when fused with an AMP, neutralize the overall cationic charge on the AMP. Thus toxicity of the AMP to the host cells is reduced. Also known as fusion partners, these carrier proteins reportedly also increase the solubility of target AMPs being expressed [33].",

The yeast K. phaffii is commonly used because of its reliability, the possibility to achieve a high heterologous protein expression level, and the presence of the co-translational and post-translational processing necessary for eukaryotic proteins [140]. Furthermore, the secretory production of recombinant proteins directly into the supernatant of the culture medium is possible with K. phaffii [140]. The limited production of endogenous secretory proteins by this yeast is indeed a key attribute for the purification of recombinant protein from supernatants. The microalga C. reinhardtii has also been proposed as a promising host to produce recombinant protein [143][144][145]. The successful expression of several proteins with pharmaceutical relevance has been reported from editing of the nuclear and the chloroplastic genome [145]. While promising for biotechnological applications, considerable developments are, however, still needed before it can be used at large scale [143,144].",

After a number of efforts in the field of recombinant therapeutics and approval of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant human insulin established the importance of recombinant therapeutics. Recombinant therapeutics production involves the expression and purification of immunogenic antigens instead of the whole virus or pathogens. These recombinant vaccines are useful to control infectious diseases of animals due to reduced risk associated with live and killed viral vaccines. Recombinant therapeutics are expensive to produce but they are found to be effective in humans. There are different systems to produce recombinant therapeutics, including bacteria, insect cells, yeast, mammalian cell culture and transgenic animals. Bacteria and yeast-based production systems are more efficient because of their rapid replication rate. However, recombinant proteins need to be purified to remove host-derived proteins, and this is a major contributing factor to the cost of recombinant therapeutics (Joensuu et al., 2008). The global market of animal vaccine is almost $5507.3 million and it is likely to increase $7197.9 million in 2020. The animal vaccine market is based on poultry diseases, livestock diseases, porcine diseases, aquaculture and equine diseases. The expansion of vaccine market is boosted by many factors, but the main factor is increasing incidence of zoonotic infections in humans, which spreads by direct contact with animals or food-borne pathogens (Kolotilin et al., 2014). Expression of protective antigens in plants is a new vaccination technology that is more economical than any other available system of vaccines production (Joensuu et al., 2008).",

            "text": "A survey of the literature in this field from the past decade has revealed no standardized method developed to promote solubility for enzymes expressed through recombinant technology. This review identifies trends in the experimental design for recombinant expression studies, in the industrial biotechnology sector, that ultimately generated inclusion bodies in E. coli. Our analysis identified which methods or tools, if any, were employed in designing the recombinant expression system and the impact on the mitigation of inclusion bodies. Our goal was to highlight the factors/strategies researchers tend to prioritize and provide a measure for their popularity implicated by the frequency of their use. Our analysis was focused on work published in the field of industrial biotechnology since 2010. Manufacturing of numerous recombinant protein products, including those of biopharmaceutical use such as growth factors, antibodies, or cytokines had historically been in the remit of recombinant protein production by E. coli. Several well-cited reviews exist on the subject, which address the challenges associated with using E. coli for these purposes [16][17][18]. Over the past decade, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells have increasingly dominated the manufacturing process as hosts for expressing protein-based biologics, therapeutics, and other relevant eukaryotic proteins. CHO cell-based systems are currently used to manufacture up to 84% [19] of approved biopharmaceuticals as opposed to 30% in E. coli [16]. This was primarily following the efforts towards the sequencing the CHO genome and its subsequent publication in 2011 [20]. Nevertheless E. coli has remained the standard workhorse for industrial biotechnology applications. Our analysis, therefore, focused on enzymes of prokaryotic origin and their plasmid-based expression in E. coli. These enzymes are industrially valuable due to their sustained performance in non-conventional niche environments owing to the wide distribution prokaryotes in adverse or unique habitats [21]. This reallocation of dominant sector preference for specific hosts in the manufacturing of different types of proteins has necessitated that even more attention needed to be paid to the improvement of host strains and expression systems of E. coli tailored to specialized applications.",

            "text": "Recently, denosumab was produced from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Although mammalian cells show beneficial effects in recombinant therapeutic protein production, such as producing properly folded and posttranslationally modified proteins (PTMs; Khan, 2013), this process has a high production cost, a complicated technology, limited scalability, and the possibility of contaminating the product with human and animal pathogens (Yin et al., 2007;Leuzinger et al., 2013). \n\nThere are many protein expression systems available, such as mammalian cells, yeast, and bacteria, to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins. There are some drawbacks to each system. For instance, the bacterial expression system is a commonly used platform for producing recombinant proteins. The major drawback associated with the prokaryotic system is the lack of appropriate PTMs that may result in incorrect protein folding (Balamurugan et al., 2006). In contrast, mammalian cells have many beneficial aspects, but the production cost is high (Yin et al., 2007;Leuzinger et al., 2013). For yeast systems, there are many advantages, such as a rapid growth rate, the requirement for a simple growth medium, and the ability to perform PTMs. However, this system has some limitations, such as hyperglycosylation and complicated downstream processes (Gomes et al., 2016). For insect cell systems, there is a possibility of contamination with mammalian viruses, and also, proteases in the host cell might cause protein degradation (Hejnaes and Ransohoff, 2018). \n\nTo overcome these limitations, a plant-based production system is an alternative platform for recombinant therapeutic protein production. Plant expression platforms have several advantages over traditional expression platforms.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic systems, on the other hand, appear to be superior in producing soluble and active eukaryotic proteins [18][19][20][21]. However, their final yield tends to be lower, and the production process is more labor intensive, requiring special media and equipment, which may significantly increase the total cost of production. Another variation on the theme is the production of proteins in so-called cell-free systems. In this case, instead of using a host organism, an in vitro mixture is reconstituted for protein expression [22]. These systems are relatively costly and are not suited for high-level protein expression, even though they allow fast production and incorporation of special amino acids [23]. \n\nThe most common host organism for recombinant protein production is Escherichia coli (E. coli) [24]. As an expression system, E. coli is easy to handle, cheap, has a high growth rate and usually produces large quantities of the desired recombinant protein [25]. As mentioned earlier, its major disadvantage is the lack of PTMs, which can result in improper folding and/or IB formation of expressed eukaryotic proteins. Furthermore, bacterial codon usage, which differs from that of eukaryotes, may also be a limiting factor. This is more evident in the case of human recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. All in all, this system is still widely used due to its many advantages, as intense research is also being conducted to overcome its limitations [11,[25][26][27][28]. For example, the introduction of solubility tag(s) or co-expression of molecular chaperones can significantly improve solubility of expressed proteins [29][30][31][32]. Codon bias can also be overcome via codon optimization, or by using special strains that contain transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at levels typical of eukaryotes [24,33]. Genetic modification of E. coli strains even allows the production of glycosylated antibodies [13,34,35]. \n\nIntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack well-defined 3D structures [36].",

The focus of this review is on the provision of protein reagents when generally only small quantities are required (tens of micrograms to a few hundred milligrams). However laboratories that undertake this type of work will frequently need to produce many different types of protein and in a timescale measured in weeks. \n\nThe first choice to express any protein if it can be achieved would always be a microbial host in particular E.coli as the cells are easy, fast and cheap to culture. However post translational modifications are very limited and many proteins are expressed in an insoluble, unfolded form even when a variety of different approaches are investigated such as alternative strains, reduced temperature and co-expression of chaperones. As a consequence, higher eukaryotic hosts are frequently used, the two most common being baculovirus infected insect cells and various different mammalian cell hosts, most commonly CHO and HEK cells. A further key consideration with regard to membrane proteins is the lipid composition of the membrane which can be critical for the function of the protein. Thus for example E.coli do not contain sterols whereas mammalian cells contain cholesterol and insect cells and yeast ergosterol). Both insect and mammalian systems are used most simply when the cells are maintained in suspension culture in protein free medium. Culturing cells in suspension enables a much greater cell density to be achieved and therefore higher expression per volume of cell culture medium. The use of protein free medium greatly facilitates purification if the protein is secreted.",

            "text": "The production of various sorts of proteins with different applications in heterologous hosts has been one of the most important achievements of biotechnology and genetic engineering in recent years. Recombinant proteins are used in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, agriculture, etc. Nowadays, there is a great demand for the production of recombinant proteins to prevent, diagnose and treat human diseases. Overall, to express a recombinant protein, a DNA molecule containing the open reading frame of a particular protein is identified, isolated, cloned into a vector, and finally expressed in a suitable host. A heterologous gene can be expressed in different types of heterologous hosts, therefore, choosing a suitable host is a critical step. Mammalian cells, bacteria, yeasts, plants, and insects are hosts that have been introduced for heterologous expression of a gene or genes of interest. The bacterial host is the most used expression system due to its simple expression method and low cost. E. coli strains are the most utilized bacterial host for the expression of recombinant proteins. Known and unknown factors are involved in enhancing the expression of recombinant protein in E.coli. These known factors include the selection of suitable expression vectors, the choosing of the adjustable promoter, the picking up of the competent strain of E. coli, codon optimization, concentration of the inducer in the induction time, induction period, the translocation of heterologous proteins into the periplasm or extracellular space, application of proper affinity tags, types and condition of the culture medium, etc. Moreover, E.coli as a heterologous host has strengths and weaknesses. Identification of every aspect of E. coli can be a useful strategy to boost its efficiency in recombinant protein production. Here, we discussed the important elements that are involved in heterologous gene expression in E. coli. One of these elements is the IBs formation. Over-expression of recombinant proteins in E.coli is very likely to form IBs. These bodies are resistant to proteases and harvesting them from lysed cells can be done through moderate-speed centrifugation as well as in the case of proteins that are toxic to the host, IBs are the best solution to overcome this challenge.",

            "text": "With the development of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, the expression and production of recombinant proteins in various host organisms became feasible, easier, and more cost-effective than proteins derived from natural sources. Escherichia coli has been a widely used bacterium for the expression of recombinant proteins, mainly due to its multiple advantages such as fast growth, high yield, low production costs, easy genetic manipulation, and availability of multiple molecular tools [1][2][3]. Other hosts are also employed for technical reasons or to improve the quality of the expressed proteins. For example, prokaryotic organisms do not perform complex post-translational modifications compared to eukaryotic organisms. In addition, some toxic components of bacteria may be of concern, mainly when a given protein is intended for therapeutic use. In contrast, some yeasts are known to have a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making them well-suited for recombinant protein production [1,[4][5][6]. To make human-like proteins, yeast cells have been engineered to attach glycosylated side chains into recombinant proteins [7]. Moreover, mammalian cells are the preferred hosts for expressing highquality eukaryotic proteins, that is, proteins similar or identical to those of the original host [3,7]. \n\nRecombinant proteins are sometimes difficult to produce in their functional form using established expression systems. Thus, it is often necessary to optimize their production in the host system, e.g., to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli. Several other strategies have been developed. Besides, protein expression at low temperatures has been reported to significantly influence product quality [1,2,8]. Nonetheless, the use of low expression temperatures decreases both, cell growth and target protein yield. These drawbacks can be circumvented with the use of cold-inducible promoters to induce recombinant protein production at low temperatures [1,9,10]. \n\nThe heat shock response has been well documented in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Also, the coldshock response has been studied in different organisms [11,12].",

            "text": "The two general categories of expression systems are prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The prokaryotic systems include bacteria, and the eukaryotic systems include yeasts, filamentous fungi, insects and mammalian cells. Compared to insects and mammalian cells, bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi are generally easier to handle and represent economic heterologous platforms. This makes them more suitable for industrial applications, whereas insects and mammalian are largely used for the production of pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe information concerning the microbial species that are most frequently used for heterologous expression of recombinant lipases and phospholipases are summarized below. To determine what might be the host of choice for heterologous expression of both lipases and phospholipases, searches were carried out in Scopus and the ISI Web of Knowledge. The results obtained revealed that Escherichia coli is the most widely used host for heterologous expression of both of these enzymes, whereas, among the yeasts and fungi, Pichia pastoris has the major role ( Figure 6). In particular, E. coli accounts for the greatest proportion of the recombinantly expressed phospholipases, whereas the lipases expressed in this host amount to little more than half of all of the recombinant lipases. This is because the heterologous expression of phospholipases has been mainly carried out for providing enzymes needed for structural and functional studies, for which E. coli remains the host of choice. On the contrary, as lipases represent the most important group of enzymes for industrial applications, a large number of recombinant lipases has been produced to exploit their potential uses as industrial biocatalysts, and thus the yeast and fungal systems are preferring, which for this purpouse represent more suitable hosts than bacteria.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant therapeutic proteins has become increasingly popular for the large-scale manufacturing of medical-grade biotherapeutics [1][2][3]. Although Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast are the most established organisms for biomanufacturing of recombinant proteins, production in mammalian cells has considerable advantages, particularly for complex protein products [3,4]. When produced in mammalian cells, recombinant human proteins undergo more accurate post-translational processing, which is crucial for proteins that require complicated tertiary structures to exhibit biological activity [3,[5][6][7]. Compared to the simpler expression systems of E. coli and yeast, one of the biggest drawbacks of using mammalian cells can be the more stringent culture conditions, which can also involve anchorage-dependent growth with less efficient two-dimensional (2D) cultures. The 2D culture systems are reliable and well defined, but the limited growth surface area places them at a disadvantage with respect to large-scale production. Over the past two decades, much effort has been directed at adapting mammalian cell expression systems for more efficient three-dimensional (3D) culture in suspension. This has been Gels 2023, 9, 243 2 of 24 achieved by either adapting the mammalian cells to continuous cell lines (CCLs), such as with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that can grow directly in suspension, or growing the mammalian cells with microcarriers [8][9][10]. Whereas certain mammalian cell types that are anchorage-dependent may not be able to conform to suspension culture, most anchorage-dependent cells can grow in or on microcarriers. \n\nThe manufacturing capacity of systems using anchorage-dependent mammalian cells has become a critical issue in the development of protein-based therapeutics. As new therapeutic proteins produced in these cells are introduced, 2D systems are initially used for making high-quality products with sufficient production yields for achieving the research and development goals. As the biotherapeutic reaches the clinical phases of development, efficient bioprocessing using large-scale, state-of-the-art manufacturing paradigms becomes essential.",

            "text": "Mammalian protein production platforms have important advantages as eukaryotic expression systems and are currently being employed as indispensable \"cellular factories\" for the large-scale production of humanized therapeutic antibodies and proteins [87]. Mammalian cell expression systems can now support the large-scale production of proteins, especially of those of clinical relevance and human origin [88]. Over the last few decades, these platforms have gradually evolved and found new applications in biology, biotechnology, and medicine. Protein production platforms have had a profound impact in many areas of basic and applied research, and an increasing number of biological drugs and vaccine antigens are now recombinant mammalian proteins made using these tools [89]. Recombinant proteins and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines. Bacterial expression systems (i.e., Escherichia coli) can still be used and indeed they have been used for many therapeutic proteins. However, these prokaryotic systems do not possess the protein processing machinery that is present in eukaryotic cells. Using eukaryotic models can optimize therapeutic protein production by ensuring that proteins are properly folded, and all the necessary post-translational modifications are introduced. It is important to note that correct folding and post-translational modifications are essential for appropriate biological activity. Therefore, these modifications should be properly introduced in the most appropriate eukaryotic and \"mammalian\" cellular context. Mammalian cell expression systems and protein production platforms are important tools for producing complex biotherapeutic proteins [90]. As already mentioned, various different mammalian expression systems are also being used for protein and glycoprotein production and recent cellular engineering strategies have been developed to increase glycoprotein productivity [91], an important feature that bacterial expression systems do not possess. At present, many vaccine production pipelines utilize mammalian cell expression systems and protein production platforms.",

Only the most utilized systems are shown, as there are very few instances where mammalian cells have been used for recombinant HDP production, as it is probably too expensive and unnecessary in many cases. The bulk of the work with plant systems is based on transgenic plants to enhance their properties with genetic modifications, but not necessarily recombinant HDP production per se and bacterial cells [33]. However, choosing the optimal expression organism is critical to ensure proper protein yields, biological function, and final cost (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "In recent years, the number of recombinant proteins used for therapeutic applications has increased dramatically and outstanding importance. These demands have driven the development of a variety of improvements in protein expression technology, generally concerning mammalian and microbial culture system. Therefore, the need for recombinant proteins in fundamental research and for clinical applications is continually increasing. Although other options are available, cultivated mammalian cells are often the primary choice for protein expression when functional protein folding and complex posttranslational modifications are required [1]. Complex proteins that are impossible for bacteria, yeast or insect cells to produce can be achieved by using mammalian cells [2]. Currently about 60% of all recombinant therapeutic proteins are produced in mammalian cells, mainly because of the ability of mammalian hosts to generate high-quality proteins that are similar in their biochemical properties to the naturally occurring human forms. This growing demand for high-quality recombinant therapeutics is driving the research and development of mammalian-cell-based manufacturing systems for enhanced production yields [3]. In industrial cell culture, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are commonly used as host for the production recombinant protein. They have been extensively studied and developed, and today provide a stable platforms for the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins and there are incentives to continuously improve the cell cultivation process [4]. \n\nCHO cells have become the standard mammalian host cells used in the production of recombinant proteins, although mouse myeloma (NS0), baby hamster kidney (BHK), human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) or human-retina-derived (PERC6) cells are alternatives. All these cell lines have been adapted to grow in suspension culture and are well suited for scale-up in stirred tank bioreactors. However, CHO cells are commonly employed as a host for producing various recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications [5]. \n\nThe advantage of using CHO and NSO cells is that there are well-characterized platform technologies that allow for transfection, amplification and selection of highproducer clones [5]. However, CHO cells are mainly dominating the mass production of recombinant protein products because of their capabilities for single-cell suspension growth [6].",

            "text": "In the 1980s, Escherichia coli was the preferred host for heterologous protein expression owing to its capacity for rapid growth (cell doubling time: 20 min) in complex media; wellstudied genetics, physiology, and metabolism; rapid and direct transformation with foreign DNA; and easily scalable fermentation [1][2][3][4][5]. Despite the relative ease of use of E. coli for achieving high expression of many recombinant proteins, for some proteins, e.g., proteins of eukaryotic origin and membrane proteins, this approach can be a rather labor-intensive and ineffective endeavor. In this case, there are difficulties with protein folding and with its secretion as a consequence of the formation of inclusion bodies due to poor protein solubility [6,7]. Furthermore, certain limitations exist in terms of the ability of E. coli to heterologous proteins, thereby reducing the cost of purifying the latter [28][29][30]. To date, practical approaches have been developed and technological solutions have been described for the efficient expression of recombinant proteins in K. phaffii [31,32]. \n\nInterest in the industrial production of proteins via K. phaffii for various applicationsfeed, food additives, detergents, waste treatment processes, and textiles-keeps on increasing [26,33]. Compared to the established baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, K. phaffii offers a higher yield of a heterologous protein, grows to a higher cell density, can use methanol as a sole carbon source, and has certain advantages in protein maturation, including those involving protein folding and glycosylation [34]; these features have a positive effect on the properties of enzymes and on their thermal stability [35,36]. K. phaffii's ability (absent in S. cerevisiae) to enlarge its cell biomass and hence the yield of a desired protein is due to the fact that when cultivated under aerobic conditions, K. phaffii does not synthesize ethanol [37].",

            "text": "E. coli is among the extensively applied host for the expression of the protein [43,44] owing to its rapid expression and growth, easy cultivation, and elevated titers [45]. Moreover, its genetics are well elucidated in comparison with other microorganisms. Notwithstanding appreciable merits, the use of E. coli is associated with certain drawbacks, which can probably affect the production efficacy of recombinant proteins. For example, a higher cell density may produce a large amount of acetate harmful to cells. It is also not capable of producing very large proteins. In addition, issues related to difficulties in protein production, disulfide bonds, and refolding ability have also been observed in the E. coli system. Failure to synthesize recombinant protein because of the lack of glycosylation is another problem [46]. The modified production in mold, insect, yeast, or mammalian cells presents higher advantages for achieving glycosylation to attain a properly folded and stable protein. Over the years, other bacterial systems are also emerged for producing recombinant proteins, like engineered Lactococcus lactis as a good cell factory for expressing membrane protein [47]. They exhibit benefits over E. coli in terms of being endotoxin-free and GRAS [48]. Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were also considered preferred substitutes for E. coli expression systems to achieve a high titer of recombinant proteins. Laffitte et al. [18] cloned thaumatin II gene into E. coli K12, but the yield of protein was very low. A synthetic gene encoding thaumatin II was effectively expressed in E. coli [49]. Saraiva et al. [15] replicated the same system, resulting in about 40 mg of pure thaumatin that showed a comparable sweetness threshold value from the natural source.",

            "text": "An extraction method for legHb production from soybean root nodules is inefficient for large-scale production [16]. \n\nTo address this, a recombinant legHb has been produced through microbial fermentation processes using various microorganisms [17][18][19][20]. While most studies have focused on soybean-derived legHbs, the expression and activity of legHb variants from other plants remain underexplored, despite their potential advantages such as allergenicity reduction [21,22]. \n\nFor the recombinant legHb production, heme is an essential factor for increasing the expression levels and activities of legHbs. In the recombinant Komagatella phaffii, the addition of hemin, which is a ferric chloride heme, was helpful in increasing the activity of legHb, while the addition of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) enhanced the activity and protein concentration of legHb [23]. Currently, the recombinant K. phaffii shows the highest yield of legHb [24]. K. phaffii is a valuable host for recombinant protein production due to its capacity to achieve high cell densities and its robust protein expression capabilities [25]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast strain that has been used for food production for a long time and is recognized as a potential platform host for protein production [24]. Both yeast strains are known as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), which can be used as safe industrial hosts for the production of food ingredients [26]. The yeast strains perform posttranslational modifications, allow reactions to be segregated within subcellular organelles, and are more resistant to viral infections [27]. In addition, compared to bacterial hosts, yeast provides a eukaryotic environment that allows for complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are often essential for the correct folding and function of plant proteins [28]. This is a major advantage of yeast expression systems for the production of plant proteins.",

            "title": "Streptomycetes: Attractive Hosts for Recombinant Protein Production",
            "text": "Nowadays, we witness the increasing application of enzymes in industrial sectors, including food, detergent, and textile manufactures (Trono, 2019) and the bursting of interest in proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019). Developing efficient bioprocessing strategies for protein production is consequently of utmost importance. Most of valuable industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins are recombinant versions, produced by heterologous platforms (Adrio and Demain, 2014). However, an ideal 'universal host' for protein heterologous expression does not exist. Those microbes (as Escherichia coli or yeasts) that are still considered the first-choices to this purpose possess intrinsic limitations inevitably restricting their use. Production of heterologous proteins in E. coli is limited by self-cytotoxicity, incorrect folding, aggregation into inclusion bodies, and/or lack of secretion (Adrio and Demain, 2014). In yeasts, recombinant protein production is often associated with hyper-glycosylation and product retention within the periplasmic space (Vieira Gomes et al., 2018). \n\nIn this scenario, bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces genus might represent a promising alternative platform for recombinant protein production. Streptomycetes are Grampositive, aerobic bacteria, characterized by a mycelial life style and commonly found in soils, where they secrete multiple hydrolytic enzymes to degrade complex organic substrates. This natural secretion capacity represents their most attractive feature for recombinant protein production. Secretion may prevent local accumulation of the overexpressed recombinant proteins, reducing toxicity to host cells and promoting correct folding (Ann\u00e9 et al., 2012). It facilitates downstream recovery decreasing production costs (Hamed et al., 2018). In addition, streptomycetes are characterized by low endogenous proteolytic activity; they grow relatively fast and in inexpensive media; they do not produce pyrogenic lipopolysaccharides and endotoxins; they are not pathogenic; and they might express G + C-rich genes without codon usage optimization (Ann\u00e9 et al., 2012;Sevillano et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Membrane proteins are important drug targets and play key roles in many different cellular processes, bringing them into the focus of many research projects investigating their structure and function. The production and purification of sufficient quantities of the protein of interest in a properly folded state is a crucial prerequisite for structural and functional studies underlining the importance of a suitable production system. Due to its easy handling, relatively low cost and the accessibility of a variety of expression vectors and strains E. coli is by far the most commonly used prokaryotic host for recombinant membrane protein production. Great efforts have been made to improve the success with E. coli systems, however, production of many membrane proteins in sufficient yields still frequently fail. Therefore, alternative prokaryotic hosts have been tested for their applicability for membrane protein production but only very few have been found to be successful in a similar extent as E. coli. Among them, the most widely spread are the Gram-positive bacteria L. lactis and B. subtilis [40,41]. Both organisms are comparable to E. coli with respect to growth rate and cultivation conditions but differ in membrane architecture and at least in parts in the composition of their membrane protein folding and insertion machinery [2,14]. \n\nPreviously, Surade et al. compared the production of 37 secondary active transporters in E. coli and L. lactis and found the latter to be a less suitable host for the production of this set of proteins [35]. It was mentioned elsewhere [15] that the better performance of E. coli might be explained by the selection of proteins mostly derived from Gram-negative sources. Following this line of argument Gram-positive hosts cannot be considered as convincing alternatives to E. coli, at least for the production of proteins derived from Gram-negative sources. \n\nA few Gram-negative organisms have been examined for the production of recombinant proteins. In particular, a P. fluorescens based expression system has been developed [42] and commercialized (http://www.pfenex. com). Pseudomonas fluorescens can be cultivated to high cell densities in bioreactors and this expression platform has been extensively employed for the high-yield production of soluble and/or secreted pharmaceutical proteins.",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

            "text": "Compared to some other systems for the production of recombinant proteins, TrB is the most attractive model because they are powerful tools to meet the growing demand for therapeutic recombinant proteins. The main advantage of using TrB is a low cost of obtaining valuable complex human therapeutic proteins in easily accessible fluids. Using the constructions of tissue-specific expression, large quantities of human recombinant proteins can be expressed and produced in the extracellular space, urine, seminal plasma, milk, and blood of large transgenic animals. \n\nProteins derived from TrB have a number of advantages compared to proteins from some other sources. First of all, the use of TrB for protein production can reduce the level of contamination of food with such contaminants as: HIV and viral hepatitis, compared to the level of contamination of proteins isolated directly from human blood. It would avoid such tragedies as the infection of hemophilia patients in Europe and Japan with HIV through the drugs based on donated blood. \n\nThe second important advantage of obtaining recombinant proteins using transgenic animals is the high safety of the activity of the native protein. The ability of transgenic animals to produce complex biologically active proteins in an efficient and economical way surpasses such capabilities in bacteria, mammalian cells, transgenic plants, and insects (Houdebine 2009). As we know, bacteria are limited in their ability to perform post-translational modifications that are required for many proteins (Balbas 2001;Swartz 2001). It is due to bacteria, because they cannot add carbohydrates to polypeptide chains and cannot generate the required proteins in their mature native structure. TrB mammary glands perform post-translational modifications of protein, such as: carboxylation, glycosylation, and amidation, which are useful for the full biological activity of many proteins (Houdebine 1995;Houdebine 2000). The use of eukaryotic cells (the cultured cells of mammals) in some cases helps overcome these problems. However, the cultivation of animal cells on an industrial scale is a very expensive technology. when compared with chemical synthesis, the production of therapeutically active peptides in the milk of transgenic animals also have a large number of advantages.",

Top yields for different systems are shown in Table 4.\n\nBetween 100 and 200 therapeutic proteins have been approved in Europe and the USA.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells provide about 35% of the therapeutic protein market but the process is very expensive and the glycoproteins made are not exactly the human type, and in some cases, they must be modified. Ten percent of the market is supplied by other mammalian systems such as NSO (mouse myeloma) cells. Insect cells are also used.

Different organisms such as bacteria, tobacco plants, yeast, silkworms, goats, insects and mammalian cells have been used to produce recombinant spidroins. However, the most frequently used host organism is Escherichia coli, which enables fast and high-density cultivation, as well as the inexpensive and large-scale production of spidroins. Therefore, in our research group we use E. coli to recombinantly produce spidroins -for example, based on two different Araneus diadematus MaSp2 proteins. Another approach is using transgenic animals as hosts to produce recombinant spidroins in secreted body fluids. For example, the Lewis research group at the University of Wyoming has developed a way to incorporate a spider's silkproducing genes into goats, which secrete the spidroins into the milk. The spidroins have been used for medical applications such as suture threads and scaffolds for tendon regeneration as well as to fabricate bulletproof wear.",

            "text": "Abstract\u00a0\u00a0 The application of enzymes is expanding across diverse industries due to their nontoxic and biodegradable characteristics. Another advantage is their cost-effectiveness, reflected in reduced processing time, water, and energy consumption. Although Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus , and Streptomyces spp. are successfully used for production of industrially relevant enzymes, they still lag far behind Escherichia coli as hosts for recombinant protein production. Generally, proteins secreted by Bacillus and Streptomyces hosts are released into the culture medium; their native conformation is preserved and easier recovery process enabled. Given the resilience of both hosts in harsh environmental conditions and their spore-forming capability, a deeper understanding and broader use of Bacillus and Streptomyces as expression hosts could significantly enhance the robustness of industrial bioprocesses. This mini-review aims to compare two expression hosts, emphasizing their specific advantages in industrial surroundings such are chemical, detergent, textile, food, animal feed, leather, and paper industries. The homologous sources, heterologous hosts, and molecular tools used for the production of recombinant proteins in these hosts are discussed. The potential to use both hosts as biocatalysts is also evaluated. Undoubtedly, Bacillus and Streptomyces spp. as production hosts possess the potential to take on a more substantial role, providing superior (bio-based) process robustness and flexibility. Key points \u2022 Bacillus and Streptomyces spp. as robust hosts for enzyme production. \u2022 Industrially relevant enzyme groups for production in alternative hosts highlighted. \u2022 Molecular biology techniques are enabling easier utilization of both hosts.",

Furthermore, according to the work published on recombinant protein production, microbial biofilm systems are sometimes able to produce recombinant proteins at attractive levels. Nevertheless, several elements that affect the overall efficiency of biofilm reactors, especially limitations in the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, call for careful implementation of strategies specifically targeted for increasing recombinant protein production in these systems. \n\nAdditionally, there are several hosts that can be chosen for recombinant protein production in biofilms. However, the selection of the most appropriate expression host is limited to a few options given the characteristics of the protein and the process to be developed. In this review, we focused on two bacteria (E. coli and B. subtilis) and two filamentous fungi (A. niger and A. oryzae) since they have already been tested for recombinant production in biofilms. E. coli remains one the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production at lab and industrial scale since it offers many advantages over the other host systems, namely fast growth at high cell densities, well-characterized genetics, and availability of a large number of cloning vectors.",

            "text": "Among the many microbial hosts used for recombinant protein expression, Escherichia coli is the most preferable one because of its well-studied genetics, low culturing expenses, and the characteristics of rapid growth and high production yield (Huang, Lin & Yang, 2012;Jia & Jeon, 2016;Makrides, 1996;Rosano & Ceccarelli, 2014). As far as we know, a large number of cloning plasmids and mutant E. coli strains have been used in laboratory research and industrial production. And among them, the system known as the pET vectors in combination with the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) has gained increasing popularity (Gay et al., 2014;Jia & Jeon, 2016;Rosenberg et al., 1987;Wurm et al., 2016). \n\nThe pET vector was derived from the medium copy number plasmid pBR322, and has developed as a series of variants which are widely used for heterologous protein expression. In the pET series vectors, target genes are inserted downstream of the T7 promoter, and the T7 phage RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter and initiates transcription of target gene. The expression of the T7 RNA polymerase gene was induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sorensen & Mortensen, 2005;Studier & Moffatt, 1986;Studier et al., 1990). Although this system realizes high level of protein expression, which accounts for about 40-50% of the total cell protein, there are also some obvious drawbacks preventing it from being a common choice for industrial applications. These disadvantages mainly arise from the metabolic burden and toxicity of IPTG on E. coli and rapid over-expressions of proteins that lead to increasing formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) (Dvorak et al., 2015;Gatti-Lafranconi et al., 2011;Glick, 1995;Haddadin & Harcum, 2005). In recent years, certain strategies have been addressed to overcome these limitations.",

It has been used for this purpose for more than 40 years, so there is much accumulated knowledge about its advantages and disadvantages as an expression platform. Rosano and Ceccarelli review the tools at hand (expression vectors, strains, media composition, etc.) when using E. coli as a host (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different approaches for solving common problems, such as inclusion body (IB) formation or low yield, are also presented. \n\nOther authors delve a little deeper into these issues. Costa and coauthors give a thorough description of different fusion tags that can be appended to the target protein in order to increase its solubility and/or ease its purification from the cellular milieu (Costa et al., 2014). Along this line, Correa and coauthors present a very promising approach to straightforwardly assess the solubility of a recombinant protein by cloning the corresponding gene in 12 different expression vectors in parallel (Correa et al., 2014). Even though IB formation is mainly regarded as a nuance in the production of recombinant proteins, Ramon and coworkers make the case that this is not always true and focus on the positive side of IBs, highlighting the advantages of producing recombinant proteins as IBs for basic and applied research (Ramon et al., 2014). No or low yield can be the result of codon bias and Elena and coauthors look into one of the strategies used for solving this problem, the expression of codon optimized genes (Elena et al., 2014). Of great importance is their account of the application of this technology in the industrial setting. Not always the desired product is a protein, sometimes metabolites and fine chemicals are the goal. The review of Ceccoli and coauthors details with numerous examples how E. coli and other microorganisms can be turned into biocatalysts by strain engineering (Ceccoli et al., 2014). High-value products can thus be obtained from pure recombinant enzyme or from whole-cell systems, turning the host into an exquisitely designed and environmentally friendly chemical factory.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a gram-negative bacteria characterized by its high growth rate, the simplicity of its genome, its easy handling and its capacity to grow in different culture conditions. Therefore, E. coli is one of the most studied organisms, and it has been largely employed as a model in biological and biotechnological processes in many industries for the production of drugs, recombinant proteins or other bio-products of high interest [1,2]. Accordingly, a deeper understanding of the central metabolism, including the regulation of E. coli, is essential for optimizing the industrial processes based on the use of this bacteria. \n\nEscherichia coli is widely employed as a host cell in the production of recombinant proteins with industrial and pharmaceutical targets [3]. To achieve this aim in the most efficient way, it is important to balance the relationship between cell host metabolism and recombinant protein production. In spite of all the advantages that this bacteria offers, the use of E. coli may entail production of by-products such as acetate, which involves a decrease in biomass and recombinant protein production [4,5]. For this reason, several strategies have been developed to limit acetate accumulation, such as the use of different media and culture conditions [6][7][8], the employment of genetic engineering to limit the formation and accumulation of this compound, the expression of sRNA or the enhancement of the respiratory activity [9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Although K12 is the most studied E. coli strain (K strain), E. coli BL21 (B strain) is the most used for recombinant protein production because B strains lack some proteases, achieve higher biomass yields and produces much less acetate than E. coli K12, even in the presence of excess glucose [13,16]. \n\nEscherichia coli is able to grow using different carbon and nitrogen sources, although it shows preferences for some sources.",

            "text": "2013b). The Fh8 fusion partner is one of the few existing tags to promote simultaneously target protein solubility directly into the E. coli cytoplasm and a simple and cost-effective protein purification.\n\nThe novel Fh8 fusion system overcomes several issues related with recombinant protein production in E. coli: by using a straightforward methodology, this novel system increases protein production levels, promotes protein solubility and low cost purification, and helps for protein immunogenicity, in which the H tag facilitates a simple, rapid, and adjuvant-free production from gene to antibody (Costa et al., 2013c). This novel fusion system offers the great advantage of combining these four abilities into the two lowest molecular weight fusion partners described so far. Hence, the Fh8 fusion system appears as a valuable tool for the efficient and economical recombinant protein production in E. coli.\n\nWhile this review applies to the use of Fh8 and H tags for recombinant protein production in bacterial host systems, it is hoped that the novel fusion system presented here will apply to other hosts, as for instance, eukaryotes and mammalian cells and thus, this must be investigated.\n\nDespite being widely employed to improve soluble protein production in E. coli, fusion tags are not yet well comprehended as suggested by the general lack in literature of studies regarding their mechanism of action. Therefore, efforts should be taken to disclose how fusion tags work while promoting such a positive effect in the protein production in E. coli. Perhaps, a wide systems biology analysis can help to reveal the different pathways that fusion tags undergo in E. coli, leading also to their organization into functional groups.\n\nTaking into account the broad range of applications, the trend is that the number of available fusion tags will increase, and the understanding of their way of action will, undoubtedly, allow the development of tailored-made tools for protein production.",

            "text": "Now-a-days, plant systems have emerged as an alternative platform for large scale production of recombinant proteins as they necessitate no capital-intensive infrastructure, bioreactors, or expensive culture media, but may be quickly scaled in low-cost greenhouses using simple reagents (Chen and Davis, 2016). When compared with prokaryotic and other host systems, plants offer an alternative bioreactor system for recombinant expression due to their glycan profile and costeffective management system (Schillberg et al., 2019). Apart from the advantages mentioned above, plant systems are human pathogen free, sterile conditions are not required during production and scalable due to open-field cultivation (Buyel, 2019). For all these reasons plant expression system has been established as a prominent bioreactor for the production of therapeutic proteins such as vaccines, therapeutic proteins and growth hormones (Limkul et al., 2016;Moon et al., 2022). \n\nEach expression host has its advantages and limitations. For instance, mammalian cell systems are capable of inherently producing recombinant biologics in humanized form, but it is difficult to maintain cell lines free from human pathogens and contaminants (Sethi et al., 2021). Plant system has many advantages over other systems including rapid (production of recombinant protein starts at day 2-3 post infiltration), costeffective (produced at a cost of $0.27 for 3 mg dose of recombinant AMP), scale-up (increasing the plant biomass as required and thereby protein yield), purity (up to 99%), safety (production without any contaminant interference and functionally safe in humans) and posttranslational modifications (N-glycosylation in engineered tobacco plants, which prokaryotic host system lacks). These advantages can be briefed with an example each using N. benthamiana transient expression host system. SARS-CoV2 RBD (Receptor binding domain) Fc fusion vaccine candidate was expressed in N. benthamiana and was extracted 4 days post infiltration which gave an yield of 25 \u00b5g/g FW (Siriwattananon et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) has been steadily increasing since the 1980s, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry, with white and red biotechnology accounting for most of the market [1]. Bacterial expression systems are an attractive alternative to the more expensive or slow growing yeast or mammalian cell culture systems. Escherichia coli alone accounts for the production of 30-40% of proteins approved for therapeutic use [2]. Its well-characterised genome, the existence of many commercially available strains and their relatively low price, the high protein expression rates and the ease of performing genomic modifications to ensure high quality products explain the E. coli dominance amongst other microorganisms [1,3,4]. \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous operation was also expected in, red biotechnology, to increase productivity, operational flexibility and the response to high market demands, following the trend demonstrated in the food, chemical and petrochemical industries. However, there was no such trend, and currently there are only a few continuous processes implemented using mammalian cells [3]. The use of microbial cells in continuous production modes at industrial scale remains uncommon, except for insulin production with Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]. \n\nThe most attractive characteristics of using continuous bioreactors (chemostats) are their high space-time yield, increased productivity, reduced protein production costs and lower space requirements. Moreover, in continuous bioreactors, the microorganisms' growth rate and the media composition (on which the protein production rate depends) are controlled to achieved \"balanced growth\" [6]. Thus, the optimisation of continuous cultures for RPP requires careful consideration of these two issues: the nutrient that limits growth and the microbial growth rate. \n\nContinuous cultures should theoretically obtain products of more consistent quality than fed-batch processes [7]. Whereas in batch processing, product quality and productivity might be a trade-off, continuous biomanufacturing gives favourable recombinant protein characteristics [8]. In addition, chemostats allow for direct comparison between different experimental set-ups and eliminate some of the scale-up issues common for batch and fed-batch processes [9]. Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol.",

            "text": "Genes encoding numerous active ingredients and their synthetic pathways in products such as terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds have been identified (Li and Gaquerel, 2021). These developments have provided the necessary foundational knowledge for industrial production of high-value-added metabolites for human consumption. Synthetic biological expression systems have been constructed in bacteria, yeast, insect cell lines, mammalian cell lines, and plants. These expression platforms have different advantages and limitations in terms of yield, quality, production cycle, cost, safety, tolerance to high product concentrations, abundance of key precursors in cells, conditions for enzyme expression of heterologous pathways, and availability of gene modification tools (Figure 1). \n\nTraditional microbial chassis in bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum) and yeast (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris) have been widely studied and are used for heterologous protein expression, as these organisms are fast growing, easy to genetically manipulate, and have high productivity. However, using bacterial hosts often results in protein misfolding and aggregation into insoluble inclusion bodies in recombinant expression. These hosts also lack the membrane compartments required to effectively express membrane-bound enzymes such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, which limits their production of natural products. Their products may also be contaminated with bacterial endotoxins that restrict their long-term development as chassis (Russo et al., 2019). \n\nAlthough yeast has endomembrane compartments that are more suitable for expressing eukaryotic products, it grows as a single cell. It can also only be cultivated at scale through heterotrophic metabolism, heavily relying on costly organic carbon sources such as glucose and sucrose, leading to high production costs (Srinivasan and Smolke, 2020). Although recombinant proteins and vaccines produced in insects and mammalian cells (such as CHO and HEK293) can undergo posttranslational modifications (Courdavault and Papon, 2022), yeast remains the main chassis used in licensed pharmaceutical protein production (Zhao et al., 2021).",

            "text": "The demand for recombinant proteins such as biopharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes is expected to rise dramatically in the near future. However, the current capacity and cost of production for most recombinant proteins limits their availability [1]. Therefore, the strong global demand for low-cost and high-yield recombinant proteins is the impetus driving molecular farming, particularly in developing nations [2]. Commercial production of such recombinant proteins has traditionally relied on bacterial fermentation or mammalian cell-based production. However, limitations including cost, scalability, safety, and protein authenticity with these expression systems have prompted research into alternative platforms [3,4]. \n\nRecently, plant-based systems potentially provide a lowcost alternative for the production of recombinant proteins. Strategies for plant transformation contain stable nuclear transformation, stable plastid transformation, plant cellsuspension, and transient expression systems [5]. Plant cell suspension cultures have several advantages including the capacity for shorter life cycles, independence from environmental effects such as climate, soil quality, season, day length and weather, the lack of biosafety issues such as gene flow via pollen, and the possibility of bacterial contamination from the plant growth environment [6]. But, the yield and quality of recombinant proteins in plant cell culturebased expression systems need to be further improved. In addition, the transient expression systems, which are perhaps the fastest and the most convenient production platform for plant molecular farming, are mainly used for quick validation of expression constructs [7]. \n\nProduction of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants was initially based on integration of a target gene into the nuclear genome and later included transformation of the chloroplast genome [1]. Stable nuclear transformation leads to the expression of the transgene after integration with the host genome. This transformation confers stably inheritable traits that were not present in the untransformed host plant [5]. Plant-based systems combine advantages of both production systems: as higher eukaryotes, plants synthesis complex multimeric proteins with posttranslational modifications closely resembling mammalian modifications. In addition, production in plants eliminates the risk of product contamination by human pathogens possibly hidden in mammalian cell lines or in their complex organic production media [8].",

This increasing trend has contributed to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of various diseases and conditions. The production of biopharmaceuticals has largely been carried out through the genetic engineering of microbial and mammalian production platforms (Walsh 2018). Therapeutic candidates, such as AA, are generally prepared using eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell-based expression systems, such as with mammalian (e.g., CHO, HEK293), bacterial (e.g., Escherichia coli), or yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris) cultures. These production systems have been wellestablished and improved; however, their rapid scale-up and versatility have obvious limitations. Microbial or mammalian production systems often suffer from posttranslational modifications, increased overall maintenance costs due to elaborate culture conditions, stability problems due to difficult purification processes, and the induction of immunogenicity (Arya et al. 2021). \n\nMammalian expression system are commonly used for activin A production due to their ability to perform proper protein folding, post-translational modification (PTMs), and glycosylation (Tries et al. 2001;Ying 1988). However, high production costs and complex culture conditions make efficient large-scale expansion challenging (Walsh 2018). Yeast-based expression systems provide an alternative eukaryotic platform, but they tend to produce hyperglycosylated proteins, which can affect the biological activity and stability of the protein (Gupta and Shukla 2018). \n\nOne alternative for overcoming these challenges is the use of plant-based expression systems, such as applications with plant molecular farming that utilizes the advantages of plant expression to mass-produce recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins. Fisher et al. introduced the concept of molecular farming, or \"biopharming\", to produce recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins in plants (Fischer et al. 1999). This approach utilizes the inherent capabilities of plants to function as safe and cost-effective factories for the production of therapeutic proteins, making it a highly useful alternative for addressing some of the issues associated with microbial or mammalian production systems.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, several biological systems have been evaluated over the years for a suitable host to produce VLPs on a commercial scale. An ideal host for the commercial purification of VLPs should be nonpathogenic, easy to handle, able to grow on economic media, able to express the protein of interest in the maximum amount, allow proper folding of a large amount of expressed protein, be genetically responsive, and be easily scaled up to industrial measures [54]. The secretion of the expressed protein(s) and VLPs (both enveloped and non-enveloped) into the medium will be another beneficial facet. Looking at these attributes, a yeast-based system appears as an ideal host for the commercial production of VLPs. In Table 1, the advantages, and disadvantages of yeast over other hosts are compared. \n\nIn the past, several yeasts were successfully used to express and purify clinically relevant proteins. Yeast species, S. cerevisiae and K. phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris), fall under GARS (Generally Recognized as Safe), which is another significant advantage of using yeast-based systems for the development of VLPs [55]. Unlike the bacterial system, the yeast-based system does not suffer from endotoxin problems [56], and the solubility of expressed proteins and folding are much better in yeast compared to bacteria [57]. Furthermore, utilizing mammalian and insect cells for VLP production is expensive due to the high cost of media and poor scalability [58]. In contrast, yeast can quickly grow on simple media [59]. A yeast species, K. phaffii, can be grown to a high cell density on a commercial scale, which is not feasible with animal cells. The rapid growth of yeast cells (unlike animal cells, yeast cells grow faster with a doubling time of around 90-120 min, whereas animal cells have a doubling time of 16-18 h or more) is another advantage [60]. The growth of plants is slow and may take several weeks, months, or even years to reach the desired maturity. Another issue is the varying expression levels in different organs or tissues and more batch-to-batch variation. Other concerns include the possibility of escape into the natural environment [61].",

However, when working with living cells, subpopulation formation causes instabilities in long-term cultivations. In cascaded continuous cultivation, biomass formation and recombinant protein expression can be spatially separated. This cultivation mode was found to facilitate stable protein expression using microbial hosts, however mechanistic knowledge of this cultivation strategy is scarce. In this contribution we present a method workflow to reduce workload and accelerate the establishment of stable continuous processes with E. coli BL21(DE3) exclusively based on bioengineering methods. \n\nEscherichia coli is frequently employed in research and industry for the production of recombinant proteins [1][2][3] . The advantages of a large toolbox for genetic modifications as well as fast doubling times outweigh the negative traits, such as the lack of posttranslational modifications [3][4][5][6] . Lactose and the synthetic structural analogue IPTG (Isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranosid) are common transcription inducers for T7-based E. coli expression hosts, like BL21(DE3) [7][8][9] . Whereas IPTG is known to cause cellular stress ensuing toxic effects at concentrations higher than 1 mM 8,9 , no such effects have been reported for lactose 7,[10][11][12] . High concentrations of recombinant product additionally have been reported of causing host cell toxicity 13 , potentially favoring the use of lactose over IPTG due to slower heterologous protein expression. Furthermore, induction by lactose increases the production of soluble product 6,[14][15][16] . Recently, we reported that co-utilization of glycerol and lactose promotes recombinant protein expression and increases viability compared to a mixed-feed with glucose 17,18 .",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins, including those for medical purposes, can be produced in different expression systems, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammalian cells. Recently, plants have become a promising system for protein production. The advantages of using plants for protein production are the low cost of cultivation of plants and the safety of products due to the absence of pathogens common to both plants and animals. \n\nRecombinant proteins can be produced in plants by genetic transformation or transient expression (Pogue et al., 2002;Gleba et al., 2007;Lico et al., 2008). The creation of a transgenic plant line and, consequently, production of a protein from these plants requires considerable time and cost. The level of expression of target proteins by transgenic plants is usually low, leading to a high cost of products due to the difficulty of their purification (Edelbaum et al., 1992;Kusnadi et al., 1997). Transient gene expression provides a rapid alternative to the generation of stably transformed plants (Kapila et al., 1997). The advantages of such plant biofactories are the ease of manipulation, speed, low cost, and usually higher protein yield per weight of plant tissue. \n\nTaking advantage of the ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer a defined segment of DNA (T-DNA) to the plant nucleus (Gelvin, 2003), the molecular genetic modification of plants is most often performed using binary vector systems. These vectors consist of two parts: the first component is the T-DNA-containing cassette which is transferred to the plant cell; the second component is the vector backbone, which carries plasmid replication functions for both Escherichia coli and A. tumefaciens, selectable marker genes for bacteria and, optionally, genes encoding plasmid mobilization functions (Komori et al., 2007;Lee and Gelvin, 2008). The plant hosts Lactuca sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, or Nicotiana tabacum have been used, but more recently, Nicotiana benthamiana has become the preferred experimental plant host (Goodin et al., 2008).",

            "text": "A range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms can be chosen for protein production by PF. These include bacterial, fungal, insect, and mammalian cells. Different expression systems produce different protein yields (amount of product per unit of time) and productivities (amount of product per substance consumed). Furthermore, they have different capacities for performing post-translational modification, which can be essential for correct protein folding and protein function. Therefore, while commonly optimising for product amounts, it is essential that the relevant features of the produced protein are also retained, especially for high-risk applications such as therapeutics. Production using more complex expression hosts, such as insect and mammalian cells, is more costly, requires more time and effort, and necessitates more sophisticated production set-ups. Therefore, prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes such as yeasts are often the organisms of choice for industrial fermentation of non-therapeutic products. The extensive prior study of these organisms has also generated a greater understanding of the metabolic process associated with biomolecule production. \n\nAmong prokaryotes, E. coli is the most popular protein expression platform. It is cheap to maintain and can produce high amounts of protein, doubling once every 20 min [20,21]. However, E. coli is not the ideal host for the expression of proteins containing PTMs [22]. Native E. coli does not accommodate disulphide bonding in its cytoplasm, only in its periplasm, which is a problematic expression locus [23]. This poses challenges for the expression of eukaryotic proteins as nearly a third have disulphide bonds, which are essential to their structure [24]. Native E. coli also rarely performs glycosylation, which can be indispensable for proper protein structure and function [25,26]. Even in strains modified to allow for this, glycosylation patterns differ from those in mammals [27]. In the absence of appropriate folding and modification machinery, overexpressed proteins can aggregate in intracellular inclusion bodies [28,29]. Hence, prokaryotes are the organisms of choice for proteins without PTMs or where PTMs are not required for the required protein function [30].",

E. coli, as expression system implicates several disadvantages; insulin is obtained via the production of insulin precursors (IP), therefore in vitro cleavage and oxidative refolding are necessary. In addition, some IP forms inclusion bodies requiring solubilization. With regard to yeast-based expression systems, although the insulin is correctly folded and directly secreted in the culture supernatant, the standard recovery and purification process may require numerous steps (Mollerup et al., 2002).\n\nPlants are considered to be safe, effective, and affordable alternative systems for producing a wide variety of recombinant proteins such as enzymes, vaccines, and other biopharmaceuticals (Ma et al., 2005;Redwan, 2007;Castillo-Esparza, 2014). Their most important advantage over bacterial, yeast or mammal systems relates to the low cost of large-scale production (Twyman et al., 2003;Ma et al., 2005), partly because the necessary processes comprise existing agricultural systems, thus reducing operating and capital costs (Lico et al., 2008). Studies carried out by Tuse and collaborators have shown that costs can be as high as 1.00-2.00 dollars per kilogram of protein (Tuse et al., 2014). Plant-based expression systems hold tremendous potential for high-capacity production of insulin, in a very cost-effective manner, and may also contend with bacterial and yeast disadvantages such as extensive purification requirements (Baeshen et al., 2014). Recombinant human insulin has been successfully produced in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (Nykiforuk et al., 2006), and human proinsulin in transgenic tobacco and lettuce chloroplasts (Boyhan and Daniell, 2011), creating a natural cell store with long-term stability that provides storage until required.\n\nRecombinant proteins can be produced in plants by genetic transformation or transient expression. Stable transformation involves the chromosomal integration of the gene of interest. This process can therefore take substantial time (often years) and require considerable resources. Likewise, the expressed protein yield is relatively low, and the release of a transgenic plant implies biosecurity problems (Edel",

            "text": "Although most research with animal toxins uses native proteins that are obtained directly from animals, an alternative approach would be synthesis either by recombinant expression or chemical production (Zhao et al., 1994;Perez-Pinzon et al., 1997;Lu et al., 2016;Smith et al., 2016). \n\nRecombinant proteins are produced by employing the recombinant DNA technique, whereby the DNA sequence encoding the protein of interest is inserted into a plasmid and subsequently introduced into a host organism, such as bacteria or yeast, which will be induced to express the gene of interest. This method enables the production of proteins that are the same or similar to the original, facilitating the acquisition of large quantities and/or with superior activity (Cohen et al., 1973;Harris et al., 1986;Kopetzki et al., 1989). However, production of recombinant proteins is not an easy assignment and depends on the proper selection of suitable hosts and vectors. Besides, there is no guarantee to obtain a structurally active protein at the end of the process. Toxins are molecules that possess many cysteine and disulfide bridges that are important for protein proper folding, which makes their production even more difficult with aggregation often limiting the yield of properly folded proteins (Fahnert, 2012). These problems occur because, in most cases, the primary host of choice for the production of recombinant proteins is bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli. Undoubtedly, the production of recombinant proteins in prokaryote systems has revolutionized biochemistry. Bacterial protein expression systems are popular because they are easy to culture, fast growing and yield large quantities of recombinant protein. However, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like disulfide bridges) are indispensable for protein folding and activity, a prokaryotic expression system may not be convenient (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Stefan et al., 2015). In that case, mammalian or insect cells may be a more suitable system for recombinant protein production. These systems are able to facilitate protein proper folding and enable post-translational modifications, which are important for full biological activity.",

Therefore recombinant proteins are produced by various ways to generate large quantities for commercial and research applications in a different host such as in bacteria, yeasts, insects, and mammalian culture. Among these, plant systems are mostly preferred since they have a developed eukaryotic system. The expression of recombinant proteins in plants and plant cells has been promoted as an alternative cost-effective production platform. \n \nIn this review we described, challenges and advantages of plants as expression systems for proteins and discussed unique advantages of producing proteins recombinantly in different plants; tobacco, rice, and maize.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are used for both the treatment and prevention of diseases in humans and animals. The production of recombinant proteins in academic research is also important to identify protein functions and elucidate protein structure. Human insulin was the first therapeutic recombinant protein; it was produced in Escherichia coli in 1978 by Dr. David Goeddel and his colleagues (Goeddel et al. 1979) and was approved by FDA in 1982, then sold as 'Humulin' (Quianzon and Cheikh 2012). Since then, more than 170 recombinant protein drugs have come to the market and hundreds are currently being developed for the treatment of diseases, such as arthritis and cancer (Batta et al. 2020;Margolin et al. 2018;Marsian and Lomonossoff 2016;Pham 2018;Torre and Albericio 2021). Most of the approved recombinant biopharmaceuticals are generated in mammalian cell lines (Lalonde and Durocher 2017). Currently, biologics are produced in bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, insects, and plant systems. \n\nIn contrast to chemical compounds, recombinant proteins are very large and complex molecules with sophisticated and specific mechanisms. Because of their size and complexity, the chemical synthesis of proteins is incredibly difficult; thus, recombinant proteins are biologically produced using the protein synthesis machinery (Puetz and Wurm 2019). All production systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, such as production time, operating costs, protein yield, potential contamination from pathogenic microorganisms, posttranslational modifications, and regulatory approval. \n\nPlant expression systems have several potential advantages over conventional expression systems. Besides, the reliability of such systems for the production of highly valuable proteins has been demonstrated (Lindsay et al. 2018;Malm et al. 2019;Ward et al. 2021). The first recorded example of biopharming in plants was the production of a chimeric human growth hormone via transgenic tobacco and sunflower callus tissue in 1986 (Barta et al. 1986).",

            "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

            "text": "The field of recombinant protein production is constantly growing, providing both bulk scale enzymes for industrial processes as well as tailor-made proteins, such as antibody fragments, for medical usage. Yeasts have become a well utilized platform for recombinant protein production thanks to their ability to secrete proteins of interest (1)(2). This greatly facilitates product purification and thus helps to make a process economically competitive (3). As unicellular microorganisms they are easy to cultivate and high cell densities can be reached for industrial production processes. As eukaryotes they possess both protein folding machinery and the ability to perform post-translational modifications related to higher eukaryotes, which can be advantageous compared with prokaryotic microorganisms (1). Additionally, a large amount of research has been performed over the past decades into improving the secretion of recombinant proteins from yeast cells, engineering intracellular transport of secreted proteins as well as glycosylation patterns and protein folding. Recent studies also deal with the complex interactions between metabolism and recombinant protein production and systems biology tools allow the identification and overcoming of metabolic bottlenecks in recombinant protein production and secretion (4 -5).\n\nAlthough Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are by far the most commonly utilized yeasts for industrial production processes (6 -7), alternative host systems should also be considered. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one such alternative cell factory. Although this yeast is well known as a model organism for molecular and cell biology, its application for recombinant protein production has been demonstrated previously (8). In addition to having a well sequenced and annotated genome for which data is freely available (www.pombase.org), S. pombe is very well characterized in respect to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, transcription and translation as well as in terms of protein folding and protein quality control (9). Post-translational modification of secreted proteins, especially glycosylation, is closely related to mammalian cells (10), making S. pombe an attractive host for recombinant mammalian protein production. Secretion of recombinant human transferrin has been",

            "text": "Large-scale production of recombinant proteins that maintain immunological activity comparable (or better) to the native parasite protein is another challenge for recombinant vaccine development. Therefore, correct folding and post-translational modification (i.e., glycosylation) will depend upon the protein production host used (prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic). Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli is a popular approach, however, production of insoluble antigens (e.g., O. ostertagi rASP1) and unsuccessful application of such proteins in vaccination trials (e.g., OPA and H-gal-GP) have been observed Cachat et al., 2010;Matthews et al., 2016). In some cases production of antigens as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein (MBP) and glutathione-Stransferase (GST) in E. coli have resulted in excellent protection during vaccination trials, as exemplified by T. solium antigens, TSOL16 and TSOL45-1A (in QuilA adjuvant) (Gauci et al., 2012). However, these results might be due to ancillary factors aside from the chosen recombinant antigen that may contribute to the observed protection conferred by native preparations. Moreover, recombinant antigen quality (such as protein solubility, folding and glycosylation) produced by protein production hosts may influence the host immune response (e.g., isoform, specificity and avidity of antibodies produced) (Matthews et al., 2016). To mitigate such outcomes recombinant protein production can be attempted in parasite-derived cells or a closely related species (e.g., C. elegans and bacculovirus-insect cell expression systems) in order to produce a protein mimicking the native molecule (Nisbet and Huntley, 2006;Roberts et al., 2013;Hussein et al., 2015;Van Oers et al., 2015). However, for some antigens like H. contortus antigen H11, protein recombinantly produced in C. elegans was unsuccessful when applied in experimental va",

            "text": "Today, mammalian cell lines represent the most widely used expression system for the production of recombinant antibodies. Several other hosts are being developed which are even able to produce antibodies with human-like glycosylation patterns. In addition to this, there are several applications where the glycosylation pattern does not play a critical role, such as for in vitro diagnostics or in research. Therefore, bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi, and insect cells can be employed in order to lower the production costs of these products. In principle, transgenic plants and animals have the highest potential for up-scaling processes to theoretically unlimited production amounts. An overview of recombinant antibodies produced in different hosts is shown in Table 1. There, however, it must be discriminated between the yield of functional antibodies after purification and the total yield. Antibody phage display is now a widespread method for the development of antibody fragments such as scFv or Fab. The expression host used in this technology is E. coli which is known to be the best genetically examined organism providing a large set of molecular biological tools for genetical engineering. Consequently, both antibody generation and production can be performed without changing the production system. Using high-cell density fermentation, the yield can be up to 1-2 g/L depending on the individual antibody fragment. Antibody fragments expressed in E. coli are mainly secreted into the periplasm and have to be extracted from there. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane and are well suited for biotechnological processes due to their powerful secretion apparatus which allow easy purification directly from the cultivation supernatant. However, antibody production systems employing Gram-positive bacteria are still in the developmental stage. However, larger antibody formats are very difficult to express in bacteria, if they can be expressed at all. Furthermore, the lack of a glycosylation apparatus limits their use, if effector functions are needed. \n\nYeasts, as an eukaryotic organism, has the capacity to perform post-translational modifications. In addition, they can be used even in high throughput processes and glyco-engineering enables the expression of recombinant proteins with human-like glycosylation. Nevertheless, the production of full-size immunoglobulins remains a challenge.",

Apparently, autotrophs and mixotrophs have drawbacks, which are described in detail below. Hence, the focus moves to heterotrophic microalgae that can grow well in the dark, like yeast and bacteria, by using simple carbon sources, such as glucose. Other advantages of heterotrophic microalgae for expression of phytochemicals include the following: \n\n(1) Compared with traditional used host, prokaryotic hosts are the most commonly used platforms. Due to post-translational modification and protein localization are important for the production of phytocompounds or eukaryotic substances, whereas, prokaryotic Escherichia coli is not always the easiest hosts for this process (Yang et al., 2016). However another eukaryotic hosts including insect, mammalian cells, and transgenic animals may overcome these obstacles, but these systems might suffer from other limitations, such as virus contamination, proteolysis, expensive cost, incorrect glycosylation, high nutrient requirement, and long generation time (Gomes et al., 2016). Hence, alternative hosts are still needed. For example, eukaryotic microalgae, this is because they give the advantages of fast growing, low cost, ease manipulation, and etc. (Yang et al., 2016). Moreover, they allow glycosylated proteins to be secreted into the cell from post-translational modification pathways (Lauersen et al., 2013). The comparison of advantages and disadvantages to produce plant compounds among host systems and other methods is summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "ecombinant pharmaceutical proteins such as antibody fragments offer many advantages over traditional drugs. There are several platforms for production of target recombinant proteins, including bacterial, yeasts, and mammalian expression systems [1,2] . Although the selection of the expression host is dependent on the nature of the target protein, the E. coli expression system is the preferred host for screening and even initial development of commercial recombinant products [3,4] . The advantages of using E. coli as a bacterial expression system include the rapid growth rate to high cell density, inexpensive production substrate, and easy genetic manipulation and transformation [4,5] . The efficiency of the recombinant protein expression in this host is related to the genetic characteristics of the E. coli strain, expression vectors and the target heterologous protein.\n\nIn addition, manipulation of the expression process to optimize protein production is essential to enhance the yield of the protein [6] . The classical method for optimization of a protein expression is to change one factor at a time while keeping other factors constant. This method is often ineffective because changing one factor at a time does not represent the combined effect of the involved variables. In addition, it is a timeconsuming process and needs a large number of experiments [6,7] . To overcome this problem, the best approach is to use the statistical design of experiments, which allows simultaneous evaluation of many more variables at lower cost with a few experimental trials [6][7][8] . In view of this consideration, the goal of this work was to improve the expression of a previously described fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, in E. coli [9] , using experimental design.",

            "text": "Proteins play crucial roles in living organisms, including humans, to enable a large number of fundamental processes, such as cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, cell division and cell growth and differentiation. The continuous progress in biotechnology, including genetic and protein engineering, in the last few decades has made it possible to manipulate different platforms for the commercial-scale production of proteins in transgenic bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, insects, mammalian and plant cell cultures and transgenic animals and plants. These biotechnological advances have significantly affected many industries, including food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, enzyme, hormone, textile, leather, paper, pulp, polymer, plastics and agriculture industries. For example, there are more than 200 approved peptide and protein pharmaceuticals in the US Food and Drug Administration list, including human insulin, serum albumin, human growth hormone, various antibodies, edible vaccines, collagen, human epidermal growth factor and blood coagulating protein (Factor VIII), among many others. \n\nOf the different recombinant proteins that are produced on a commercial scale, 39% are made in Escherichia coli, 35% in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 15% in yeasts, 10% by other mammalian systems and 1% by other bacteria and systems (Rader 2008). Microorganisms and cell cultures are robust recombinant protein synthesis production systems. They possess certain challenges, however, such as high culture development costs, high cell culture maintenance costs, cell culture variability and limitations concerning the production of large molecular weight proteins. \n\nIn principle, DNA from any source can be manipulated in any living system. Genetically engineered animals have been created that produce recombinant proteins in their tissues, milk, blood or urine (http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=q0WCjX8jUE4). By the late 1980s, it was shown that transgenic plants could be used as alternative, commercial-scale, recombinant protein production platforms, after immunoglobulins and the assembly of functional antibodies were successfully achieved at 1.3% of the total leaf protein in tobacco leaves (Hiatt et al. 1989).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli), a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium, is an important research platform for synthetic biology [1]. Owing to various advantages, such as low cost, rapid growth, and ease of geneticmanipulation, E. coli can be manipulated as a cell factory for the production virus-derived proteins, antibody fragments, enzymes, lipids, and a range of other bio-products [2,3]. Of particular interest in more recent years is the use of E. coli for the manufacture of genetically engineered drugs, such as interferon and insulin [4,5], and in the development of recombinant human vaccines against hepatitis E virus (HEV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [6,7]. \n\nHowever, despite these advantages, there are several limitations in using the E. coli expression system for the manufacture of exogenous proteins [8,9]. To date, the synthesis of therapeutic proteins using the E. coli expression system at a laboratory scale have been based on plasmid expression, with an antibiotic resistance gene usually incorporated into the plasmid for cloning and stability. However, in large-scale fermentation, the structural and segregational instability of plasmids and the metabolic burden on the cells for high rates of plasmid replication have a negative impact on gene expression delity and host strain viability [10]. Additionally, the use of antibiotics carries considerable risk for public health and the environment [11] and thus must be excluded in the culture. Such high-density continuous fermentation using antibiotic-free culture carries inherent problems with batch consistency [12]. Finally, an additional concern with Gram-negative bacteria is the extra-membrane component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin that, in high concentrations, induces pyretic response and septic shock in mammalian hosts [13]. Therapeutic proteins expressed using the E. coli expression system can be easily contaminated with LPS and, thus, residual endotoxin contamination in recombinant therapeutic proteins is strictly monitored [14]. As yet, there is no e cient method to remove LPS completely [15].",

However, it is less suitable for complex proteins requiring specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Corchero et al., 2013). Escherichia coli produces about 30% of therapeutic proteins but lacks PTMs like glycosylation and phosphorylation, crucial for many protein therapies (Baeshen et al., 2015). Efforts are ongoing to engineer E. coli strains to overcome this limitation, but currently, complex proteins are mainly produced using mammalian cell culture. Escherichia coli is also utilized in biofuel and bio-alcohol production, benefiting from its ability to grow in different conditions and its high growth and metabolism rates (Chen et al., 2013;Koppolu and Vasigala, 2016;Wang et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2020). Challenges include processing cheap raw materials like cellulosic and hemicellulosic hydrolysates, which can contain growth-inhibiting toxic compounds and cause osmotic stress when using concentrated sugars (Koppolu and Vasigala, 2016). \n\nThe fungal kingdom, encompassing yeasts to filamentous fungi, excels in producing bio-based products like enzymes, acids, and pharmaceuticals (Meyer et al., 2016;Sanchez and Demain, 2017;Corbu et al., 2023). Species like Aspergillus, Trichoderma reesei, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are key in recombinant protein and industrial enzyme production (El-Gendi et al., 2021;L\u00fcbeck and L\u00fcbeck, 2022). Fungi also generate sustainable biomaterials, food ingredients with prebiotic benefits, and aid in fermentation in food and beverage industries (Patel et al., 2016;Singdevsachan et al., 2016;W\u00f6sten, 2019). Agriculturally, they enhance crop growth through nutrient uptake symbiosis (Wu et al., 2022). However, some fungi pose health threats (Fisher et al., 2020).",

In this regard, the laboratory workhorse, Escherichia coli, has been essential for the simple low-cost expression of the majority of proteins investigated to date. However, a number of biomedically relevant proteins fail to express and fold properly in prokaryotic expression hosts. For example, mammalian secreted proteins and membrane bound receptors often contain obligate post-translational modifications including disulfide bonds and unique glycosylation patterns that are required for proper folding and/or biological activity, preventing their expression in prokaryotes. Alternatively, a number of powerful eukaryotic expression systems are available for expression of challenging proteins including those that contain unique post-translational modifications. The most common over-expression platforms currently include yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), baculovirus expression vector systems (Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus and insect cell hosts Spodoptera frugiperda or Trichoplusia ni), and mammalian cell systems (including a variety of transformed cell lines such as CHO and HEK293). It should be noted that each expression platform has its own merits and disadvantages, and one may be more suitable for a particular protein over others.",

            "text": "Nowadays, with the advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics, coupled with the boom of sequencing and omic techniques, it is possible to express natural products in bacterial or yeast cells. The most frequently encountered species are Escherichia coli [19] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [20,21]. The competitive advantages that render these species ideal hosts are their relatively rapid growth, their deeply dissected physiology and well-known behavior in fermenters as well as the wide accessibility to genetic tools amenable to these organisms. The knowledge around the genetics of these species and the requirement of inexpensive cultivation media to achieve high cell densities in bioreactors are also key factors [21]. The approaches are not limited to the production of industrially relevant commodity chemicals but also to the production of recombinant proteins [22]. For example, E. coli has been implemented for the manufacturing of nearly 30 % of the approved recombinant therapeutics [19]. \n\nAnother industrially important production process of bulk biochemicals is that of amino acids, i.e., L-lysine and L-glutamate, which serve among others as flavor enhancers [11]. The fermentation process was initiated making use of wild strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum and has recently become one of the most promising processes for commercial production of amino acids because genetic engineering routes facilitated a substantial yield increase for the targeted compounds of up to 50 mass %, along with higher specificity and productivity. By applying site-specific mutations, pathway modifications, and transcriptional attenuation regulations on E. coli, the production of aromatic amino acids, i.e., L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan, and branched chain amino acids, i.e., L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine, was successful [11].",

            "text": "The Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the expression host of choice for the production of 30% to 40% of recombinant drugs in industry [1,2]. As E. coli shows very fast replication rates [3,4] on comparatively cheap media [5], the benefits often outweigh the numerous purification steps [1,6] and the missing glycosylation pattern [1,7,8]. Recombinant protein production in E. coli gained more interest again as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments increased, which can be properly expressed in E. coli [1,8]. The strain BL21(DE3), created by F. Studier and B. Moffatt back in 1986 [9], is often used in an industrial scale because of very low acetate formation, high replication rates as an effect of the integrated T7-polymerase [9][10][11][12][13][14], as well as the possibility of protein secretion into the fermentation broth due to a type 2 secretion protein [15][16][17]. As the lac operon is still one of the most favored promotors in pET-expression systems [3,12,18], it is generally used for insertion of the gene of interest. The repressor protein can only be blocked by allolactose or a structural analogue [19], e.g., the well-known inducer isopropyl \u03b2-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [3,13]. However, induction with IPTG stresses the cells, as IPTG in higher concentrations is referred to be toxic at elevated induction times [13,18,20]. As tunable protein production is commonly applied in industry nowadays, mixed-feed systems using either IPTG [21] or lactose [13,22,23] as inducer did result in higher product yields when compared to other inducer supplies [24]. Soft induction performed with lactose shows promising results [13,23,25]. As lactose can be metabolized in E. coli, it does not stress the cells as much as IPTG [26].",

            "text": "The diversity of chemical and structural attributes of proteins makes it inherently difficult to produce a wide range of proteins in a single recombinant protein production system. The nature of the target proteins themselves, along with cost, ease of use, and speed, are typically cited as major factors to consider in production. Despite a wide variety of alternative expression systems, most recombinant proteins for research and therapeutics are produced in a limited number of systems: Escherichia coli , yeast, insect cells, and the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and CHO. Recent interest in Vibrio natriegens as a new bacterial recombinant protein expression host is due in part to its short doubling time of \u2264\u200910\u00a0min but also stems from the promise of compatibility with techniques and genetic systems developed for E. coli . We successfully incorporated V. natriegens as an additional bacterial expression system for recombinant protein production and report improvements to published protocols as well as new protocols that expand the versatility of the system. While not all proteins benefit from production in V. natriegens , we successfully produced several proteins that were difficult or impossible to produce in E. coli . We also show that in some cases, the increased yield is due to higher levels of properly folded protein. Additionally, we were able to adapt our enhanced isotope incorporation methods for use with V. natriegens . Taken together, these observations and improvements allowed production of proteins for structural biology, biochemistry, assay development, and structure-based drug design in V. natriegens that were impossible and/or unaffordable to produce in E. coli . Production of proteins with reduced aggregation compared to E. coli . Optimized protocols for efficiency and protein expression. Improved yield for specific proteins compared to E. coli .",

            "text": "Proteins, which are made of one or more chains of amino acid residues, are tremendously diverse in both their structures and functions. Proteins perform a vast spectrum of structural, biochemical and molecular activities within organisms. Many of these biological functions of proteins also have important medical, industrial and scientific applications. By 2018, 374 protein-based pharmaceutical products had gained a license in the United States and European Union, which accounts for about a third of all pharmaceuticals in development [1]. These protein-based pharmaceutical products include monoclonal antibodies, hormones, enzymes, vaccines, clotting and growth factors. Recombinant proteins including enzymes have also been extensively used in production of textiles and chemicals and in processing of food and feed. Other recombinant proteins have been widely used in diagnostics and scientific research. The global protein expression market size was US$1.65 billion in 2017 and was projected to increase at more than 10% annually to reach US$6.47 billion by 2030 [2,3]. \n\nMost recombinant proteins are currently produced in bacteria (mainly Escherichia coli) and mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells). Bacterial cells are easy and cheap to culture but lack the capacity to perform certain post-translational modifications. As a result, many complex proteins particularly those therapeutic antibodies and vaccines are usually produced in mammalian cells [2,3]. With the development of plant transformation in early 1980s [4,5], the potential to produce recombinant proteins in plants has also been extensively explored. Plants and plant cells have a number of advantages over bacterial and mammalian platforms for production of recombinant proteins including therapeutic proteins [6]. These advantages include the low cost and relatively high speed of recombinant protein production at a large scale in plants and plant cells [7,8]. As eukaryotic organisms, plants can carry out many of the post-translational modifications for production of complex proteins but do not require animal derived reagents (serum-free) for cultivation [9]. Plants also lack harmful or toxic substances present in bacteria and many therapeutic proteins and injectable and edible vaccines do not require extensive purification when produced in plants [9][10][11].",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA technology and protein engineering provide the production of enzymes tailored to meet the needs of users or the process, obtaining enzymes of superior quality to natural properties. Cheaper, easier, and faster protein expression can be performed in prokaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli, however, eukaryotic proteins can be toxic to bacteria and this bacterium cannot express high-molecular-weight proteins, in addition to not being the system of choice for proteins rich in S-S and proteins that require post-translational modifications, as they cannot carry out glycosylation and remove the S-S sequences [1,2]. Yeasts, unicellular eukaryotic fungal organisms, are often used to produce recombinant proteins that do not produce well in E. coli due to folding problems or the need for glycosylation. The advantages of yeast expression systems include: high throughput; stable production strains; durability; cost benefit; high density growth; high productivity; suitability for isotopically labeled protein production; rapid growth in chemically defined media being easily adapted to fermentation processes; mammalian cell-like product processing; proteins with molecular weight higher than 50 kDa can be produced; signal sequences can be removed; can handle S-S-rich proteins promoting disulfide bond formation; produce chaperones to aid in the folding of certain proteins; and can glycosylate proteins [1,3]. The two most used yeasts are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, renamed as Komagataella pastoris or K. phaffii [1]. Methylotrophic yeasts can use methanol as the only source of carbon and energy. The enzyme alcohol oxidase (AOX; EC 1.1.3.13) catalyzes the first step in the methanol utilization pathway: the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The AOX is sequestered within the peroxisome along with catalase, which degrades hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water.",

            "text": "However, E. coli a bacterial expression host is still a choice of system due to its well characterized genetics, rapid growth rate and use of inexpensive substrates for cultivations [11,12,13]. Many proteins of vaccine or therapeutic use are produced in E. coli using batch and fed-batch fermentation process [11][12][13][14]. It would be very useful if the optimized production as well as purification processes could be easily scaled up to an industrial scale for the bioprocess industry. Fermentation media, mode of fermentation, scale up and culture conditions are the most significant factors in a production process. Media composition especially with the essential carbon and nitrogen components is optimized to produce large amount of desired product. Fed-batch fermentation is a common technique in this regard to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins [14,15,16]. Increasing the scale of production is usually associated with reduction in the desired product yield due to the complexity associated with fermentation process. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the scaling up of laboratory scale fermentation process and apply suitable strategy in order to enhance the productivity of the desired recombinant protein on the large scale. \n\nHigh-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulates as insoluble, inactive aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies in vivo [17,18,19]. Although the recombinant protein expression in the form of IBs has advantages, the inactive recombinant proteins need to be converted into soluble and correctly folded proteins [20]. The solubilization of IBs was carried out using higher concentration of denaturing agent which must be removed using refolding processes to obtain biologically active recombinant product for vaccine studies. In recent years, several refolding techniques such as rapid dilution, dialysis, diafiltration, high pH solubilization and on column refolding using chromatographic techniques have been used for recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins [17,20,21,22]. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has emerged as a powerful technique for purification of recombinant proteins [22].",

The gene of interest is inserted into the host organism, either as a plasmid (bacterial or yeast systems) or via genomic integration. 92 A great deal of effort to enhance integration efficiencies and optimizing alternative integration mechanisms in recent years has diversified the selection of the production host. 92 This is important, since choosing the correct expression system is mostly protein-dependent, and factors such as protein quality, functionality, production speed, and yield (titers) are the relevant parameters. 88,90,93 Alternatively, protein production pathways can be isolated from cells and utilized in cell-free protein synthesis methods, sometimes referred to as 'In vitro Transcription and translation (IVTT)'. In addition, chemical synthesis can produce proteins, however due to limitations in the size of the protein that can be produced and the costs of large-scale manufacturing, this technique has yet to be implemented for the production of pharmaceutical proteins. 94",

            "text": "Vaccines and therapeutic proteins are the great successes of modern medicine, which have been used for several decades to prevent diseases and eradicate them. The uses of vaccines and therapeutic proteins have great potential but are limited by their cost of production, distribution, and delivery. Modified mammalian cells are used for producing therapeutic proteins, which have the advantage of resulting in products that are similar to their natural counterparts. These cells can be cultured on a limited scale but production is quite expensive. Bacteria can be used for large-scale production of proteins, but the products differ from the natural products considerably. For example, the proteins that are usually glycosylated in humans are not glycosylated by bacteria. Moreover, many proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli on a large scale, but sometimes they may differ in conformation with eventual precipitation due to a lack of proper folding and disulfide bridges (Daniell et al. 2001d). \n\nFor ages, humans have been using plants as a source of food, clothing, medicine, and building materials. Plants have been of immense help in the past and continue to be so. Plants are now one of the new hosts for the production of biopharmaceuticals, polymers, vaccines, enzymes, plasma proteins, and antibodies. There are many advantages in production of recombinant proteins in plants. Primarily, plant systems are more economical in that they can be produced on a large scale rather than using industrial methods (fermentation of bacteria, yeast or cultured animal or human cell lines) that are very expensive. Also, there is no need to maintain the cold chain as the plant parts expressing the vaccine or plant extracts can be stored and transported at room temperature. Plants have the ability to carry out posttranslational modifications similar to naturally occurring systems. There is also minimized risk of contamination from potential human pathogens, as plants are not hosts for human infectious agents (Giddings et al. 2000). If therapeutic proteins are delivered orally, then the purification step from plants can be eliminated. Other advantages of foodbased vaccines include the low cost of raw material and convenient storage; the cost of syringes and needles in delivery of vaccines is eliminated, which thereby eliminates blood-borne pathogens.",

            "text": "To produce recombinant proteins, various types of hosts, including eukaryotes such as plants, mammalian cells, insect cells, filamentous fungi, and yeast, or prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus sp. are employed [1][2][3]. To decide which production system is most suitable, the nature, origin, and final application of the target proteins must be considered. For example, if a downstream process modification such as glycosylation is not essential for bioactivity, bacterial expression systems are attractive for heterologous protein production because of their ability to grow rapidly and to reach high cell density using inexpensive substrates, as well as their genetics are well-characterized. Furthermore, a large number of cloning vectors and modified host strains are available [3]. In this study, we described the use of molecular biological strategies, including the alternation of secretory proteins to allow proper cytoplasmic folding and co-expression of molecular chaperones to assist the folding in order to improve the production of active recombinant proteins in the bacterial host, E. coli. It was reported that DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE or Trigger factor (Tf) assisted in increasing the solubility of some proteins at the early stages of the protein folding pathway [4], while GroEL-GroES was required at a later folding stage [5]. The chaperones were also reported to minimize protein aggregation by mediating the degradation of proteins that cannot be properly folded, as observed with some proteins when co-expressed with chaperones [6]. The recombinant proteins of interest in this study were enzymes involved in non-starch polysaccharide hydrolases; \u03b2-1,4-xylanase (Xyn; EC 3.2.1.8), \u03b2-1,4-glucanase (Cel; EC 3.2.1.4) and \u03b2-mannanase (Man; EC 3.2.1.78) and those involved in aromatic compound degradation pathway; benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC; EC 4.1.1.7)",

            "text": "To overcome the problems faced by conventional L-ASNase production, one approach would be to use recombinant DNA technology, to transfer genes that encode the enzyme, from one microorganism to another. This is called heterologous expression (Li et al., 2019). Heterologous expression allows the relatively stable, safer expression of enzymes, with higher yields (Patel et al., 2022). There are several expression systems available for biopharmaceutical purposes, including bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, mammalian cells, plants, insects, transgenic animals, and even microalgae (dos Santos et al., 2018). Each system has its particular features in terms of production capacity, costs, safety, complexity, and specific processing (Schmidt, 2004). The use of complex and costly expression systems, such as mammalian cells (CHO, insects, etc.), are generally used for proteins that require complex posttranslational modifications, which in the case of L-ASNase are not necessary. Concerning the use of plant-based expression systems, these display several disadvantages due to the large numbers of proteases present in their cells, making extraction and purification challenging for large-scale enzyme production (Patel et al., 2022). The high secretors and the host strains of bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris) are most commonly used for the homologous and heterologous expression of recombinant enzymes without complex post-translational modifications (Goswami et al., 2015). Among these, E. coli, B. subtilis and P. pastoris are used for the production of L-ASNase, since these can quickly and easily overexpress (Wang et al., 2021;Patel et al., 2022). However, the yields of L-ASNase production depend not only on host selection. But also of the fermentation process, and the efficiency of the expression systems (Li et al., 2019).",

            "text": "The production of useful proteins using microbes has attracted attention due to scientific, therapeutic, environmental, and agricultural applications. The secretory production of proteins has three major potential advantages: secreted target proteins are usually natively folded, the degradation of target proteins by intracellular proteases can be suppressed, and there is a reduced requirement for expensive extraction and purification procedures [1][2][3][4]. \n\nTherefore, the secretory production of valuable proteins is an industrially effective method to simplify purification procedures and avoid refolding processes and extraction from cells. In the last few decades, many protein expression systems have been developed using various kinds of microbes. Park et al. succeeded in the production of FDA approved pharmaceuticals such as insulin and hepatitis B surface antigen using Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5], and Bacillus subtilis has been used to successfully produce esterase and cutinase [6]. Among microbial systems, Escherichia coli is the most widely used due to its high expression levels (1-5 g/l) and simplicity of genetic manipulation [7][8][9]. However, with E. coli, produced proteins are usually obtained in the intracellular fraction and need to be extracted from cells. \n\nStreptomyces species are Gram-positive, aerobic, myceliaforming oil bacteria. In general, Streptomyces are widely used as a host to produce antibiotics and other industrial enzymes [10][11][12]. In particular, Streptomyces lividans is an attractive host that has high ability to secrete heterologous proteins in the culture supernatant. Sianidis et al. successfully produced xyloglucanase from Jonesia sp. [13]. Lin et al. successfully produced Streptomyces platensis transglutaminase using S. lividans as the expression host [14].",

            "text": "Different expression systems can be exploited to produce recombinant proteins (e.g., bacteria, yeasts, fungi, mammals, plants, and insects). When comparing mammalian hosts, microbial expression systems are generally considered as robust, easy to work with, and cost-effective, which are desirable features for biopharmaceutical production [68,73]. The yeast-based expression system is one of the most common approaches for industrial recombinant protein production [4,74]. As an advantageous system to produce recombinant proteins, yeast cells can be grown at high-density fermentation in a shorter amount of time than that of mammalian cells, with the ability to perform (i) proper folding, (ii) proteolytic processing, (iii) disulphide bridge formation, and (iv) glycosylation [4,75] on the product of interest. Compared with insect or mammalian expression systems, K. phaffii is simple to operate, low in cost, and takes an unsophisticated large-scale approach. Post-transcriptional processing and modifications in yeasts are suitable functions for the stable expression of functional heterologous proteins. Glycoengineered K. phaffii strains have been optimized during the last decades to synthesize recombinant protein with humanized and homogenous glycosylation patterns, increasing the interest for this host [76][77][78]. Some disadvantages also characterize these hosts, especially considering their native post-translational modifications, which can be different from those happening in mammalian cells. To overcome this issue, some companies specializing in K. phaffii engineering (e.g., BioGrammatics, VALIDOGEN GmbH, and Bisy GmbH) have developed strains to bypass the main differences between higher eukaryotic cells and yeast. In terms of the production of protein with similar glycosylation to those in mammalian cells, different methods have been applied to engineer the N-glycosylation route. The hyperglycosyl N-glycans native in yeast can be switched to human biantennary complex-type N-glycans. K. phaffii has been genetically modified to form human",

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technology has widened the research arena for biologists. The manipulation of Escherichia coli provided the first expression system (Itakura et al. 1977) for therapeutic proteins, pioneering the production of recombinant proteins. The subsequent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Human insulin receives FDA approval 1982), of an E. coli-based insulin (Goeddel et al. 1979) confirmed the utility of recombinant therapeutic protein production. As a prokaryote, E. coli cannot accurately express complex eukaryotic protein because almost all eukaryotic proteins are modified post-translationally and require the appropriate machinery to impart the characteristic structural features that are essential for their functional integrity. Resolution of this problem has led to the development of other expression systems, including the yeast system, the Baculovirus system, the mammalian cell system, and the plant expression system. Each type of expression system has been used extensively for the production of recombinant therapeutic compounds, with varying success, because no single system is universally appropriate for all tasks. However, plant expression systems excel in the production of plant-derived edible vaccines (Goeddel et al. 1979;Mishra et al. 2008;Yang and Yang 2010) and have tremendous growth potential as the basis of the modern discipline, providing immediate cures for infectious diseases. Simultaneous expression of multigenes reviewed by (Zorrilla-Lopez et al. 2013) into plants can alter complex metabolic pathways that can be used to produce compounds of pharmaceutics. \n\nThe transfer of foreign DNA from diverse organisms and its integration into a host genome form the backbone of recombinant DNA technology. However, the expression of a foreign gene in a host plant cell is dependent on the cumulative effects of several elements essential for cell transformation (coding sequence, promoter region, transcript termination, etc.), the plant cell pH, the efficiency and accuracy of the transcriptional and translational machinery, plant cell biochemistry, the availability of the amino acids required for the recombinant protein, the interaction between and storage of the expressed proteins in the plant cellular environment, and many other predictable and unknown factors.",

From the beginning, both the mammalian as well as the microbial route were explored for the production of tPA [2]. tPA is a fairly large (527 amino acids) monomeric protein containing 17 disulfide bridges.

E. coli would generate the basic components as they are a prolific organisms that is easy to engineer and can produce high yields while being cost effective. As E. coli mostly lacks the ability to perform posttranslational modifications and since those are vital for the biological activity of human proteins, other systems such as yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris,..) or mammalian cells (CHO,..) could be used to modify those building blocks and produce the biologically active protein. (D) Biofuels: Biodiesel production from lignocellulosic material. Clostridium thermocellum would first break down lignocellulose into 5-and 6-carbon sugars at high temperature and anaerobic condition, that would then be fermented by Zymomonas mobilis and Pichia stipidis to ethanol.

Some of the advantages of using E. coli are the ease of engineering their genome, their rapid growth, easy culture and high product yields. One major limitation of E. coli or unicellular bacteria in general when it comes to producing eukaryotic recombinant polypeptides, is that they lack the ability to perform the posttranslational modifications necessary for the biological activity of some proteins, most importantly glycosylation. This issue was partially overcome by transferring the ability of the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni to glycosylate proteins to E. coli, although the structure of the glycosylation differs from that observed in eukaryotes (Wacker et al., 2002;Ihssen et al., 2010).\n\nYeast, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is often the preferred host for expression of proteins that require posttranslational modification for its biological activity.

            "text": "The most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination. IPTGinduction of the chromosomally encoded bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase leads to high level expression of T7 promoter-controlled genes and correspondingly high recombinant protein titers. High level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli frequently leads to an impact on host cell metabolism detectable through growth retardation and generally known as \"metabolic burden\" [1,2]. The factors contributing to the metabolic burden are multifaceted depending on the host/vector combination and on the properties of the encoded gene with its transcription and translation products as well as on the environmental conditions encountered during the production process [3][4][5][6]. The prime reasons for the protein production related metabolic burden have been attributed to protein translation and protein folding [1,6] as well as to transcription and plasmid amplification related processes [7][8][9]. However, production of the same protein under identical conditions in the same host/vector combination but with single codon exchanges can change the metabolic perturbations considerably [10][11][12][13] suggesting that the phenomenon is even more complex than anticipated. \n\nIn this contribution we analyze the impact of T7-promoter-controlled recombinant gene expression on the host cell metabolism using two different model proteins, the difficult-to-fold human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) with its high propensity to form inclusion bodies in E. coli and the easy-to-fold green fluorescent protein (GFP) mainly produced as soluble protein. \n\nFor both examples we generated a set of expression vectors in which either the ribosome binding site (RBS) or the promoter region or both were removed in order to analyze if the plasmid itself, the transcription of the recombinant gene, the translation into the protein product and/or protein folding related processes have an impact on host cell metabolism.",

This technique ensures the regeneration of cofactors required for reaction of interest. Secondary reactions can be avoided by knocking out genes expressing enzymes responsible for the unwanted pathway(s) or even by selection of another proper host. Such design can be tailored to be suitable at industrial scale levels with regard to the maximum substrate concentration and the physical and chemical environment. 5 treptomyces strains were successfully applied as good heterologous hosts for expression and production of target protein. 52 Many advantages of Streptomyces as recombinant hosts are that they do not form inclusion bodies, have a high secretion capacity, relatively low activity levels of extracellular proteases, 60 and are well suited for expressing GC-rich genes. 52 he deletion of genes encoding for speci\ue103c transcriptional repressors is a good strategy for enhanced protein expression in Streptomyces as reported for xylanase enzyme production. 52 ][64] Bifunctional plasmids formed from multi-copy number E. coli plasmids and Streptomyces shuttle plasmids were constructed and developed with inducible promoters, which enhanced the production of some proteins of interest. 52,65 reptomyces species as recombinant hosts for biocatalytic oxidations Some Streptomyces strains have been exploited as heterologous hosts for cytochrome P450 genes from various wild type Streptomycetes. They are better than E. coli due to high GC contents of the native Streptomyces genes (up to more than 70%), which make functional expression in E. coli more complicated. 40 S. ahygroscopicus ZB01 has high catalytic activity for the regio-speci\ue103c hydroxylation of avermectin (1) to 4 00 -oxo-avermectin (2), 65 which is a key step in the synthesis of emamectin benzoate, a potent semisynthetic insecticide.",

Only the yeast, P. pastoris, having the advantage compared to E. coli of providing an intracellular folding environment similar to that of mammalian cells, provides an excellent alternative to bacterial expression systems. Other eukaryotic expression systems like, e.g., insect cells or even mammalian cells require prohibitively expensive culture media and expensive cell culture equipment. Regarding the large group of small conotoxins with posttranslational modifications, their production is, at present, still mostly confined to chemical synthesis, e.g., by SPPS. In vitro systems comprising posttranslational modification enzymes to transform recombinant precursors into bioactive peptides have been successfully used (Ozawa et al. 2007). But at present, they offer no higher cost-effectiveness compared to the chemical synthesis and may only be used in the future in cases where refolding of chemically synthesized, highly disulfidebonded peptides with modified amino acids has not been successful. \n\nAltogether, for the majority of the presently known conopeptides, chemical synthesis is the most important method to produce large amounts of peptide. Recombinant production remains confined to conopeptides without posttranslational modifications. The rapid development of these methods in recent years may allow the biosynthetic production of some modified peptides in the future.",

A serious disadvantage with recombinant expression in E. coli is that proteins produced at high concentrations often form insoluble protein aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies (Figure 2.1) [11].

Microbial production systems are often the best option for making such products given their ease of handling and high synthesis rates [1]. At present, Escherichia coli remains the first choice of host system given its high overexpression yields, ease of genetic handling, and the wealth of information available on this microorganism [2]. However, it is not without its drawbacks, such as the formation of inclusion bodies, the presence of an outer membrane that hampers secretion, its relatively complicated aerobic fermentation system, and the formation of endotoxins such as cell wall lipopolysaccharides [3]. The presence of bacterial endotoxins is one of the major concerns of regulatory agencies, and the need to add downstream steps to ensure their removal can make otherwise simple processes quite costly [4].\n\nThe Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis has emerged as an attractive alternative for the overproduction of recombinant proteins. Due to its long, safe history of use in dairy fermentations, this bacterium has been classified as a food grade microorganism 'Generally processes), and a very simple metabolism that allows for rapid growth without aeration-all properties that facilitate scaling-up [4]. Moreover, L. lactis is likely to provide a good membrane environment for the overproduction of eukaryotic proteins [6]. Indeed, a number of eukaryotic membrane transporters, yeast mitochondrial proteins and human proteins have been heterologously expressed in this host [7]. Further, L. lactis is an efficient cellular factory able to turn out recombinant viral antigens, interleukins, allergens, virulence factors, bacteriocins and enzymes [8,9]. It can even be genetically engineered to produce proteins from pathogenic species on its cell surface, and thus be used as a vector for the production and delivery of oral vaccines against HIV, cholera, malaria, human papillomavirus, stomach ulcers, tetanus and brucellosis [10][11][12][13]",

These methods have advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of protein to be expressed 8 . For example, the E. coli heterologous expression of glycosylated macromolecules or high disulphide content proteins has the disadvantage that often the recombinant proteins are produced as insoluble or non-functional molecules 8 . In this case, it is preferable to switch to a different expression system, such as Pichia pastoris, baculovirus/insect cell system or baculovirus variants that promote greater protein secretion as well as post-translational modifications typical of eukaryotic cells 5 . However, these expression systems are very expensive with respect to the E. coli system, which is still the preferred host for the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins due to cost considerations, speed, ease of use and genetic manipulation 1 . For this reason, in commerce, it is possible to find E. coli strains capable of overcoming the problems of inefficient disulphide bond formation or engineered E. coli cells to perform protein N-glycosylation, even though the efficiency is generally very low 9 . Consequently, many attempts were made to efficiently produce a recombinant protein in E. coli, which remains the most common expression host 1,9 . In this context, a system has been developed for anchoring heterologous proteins or polypeptides on the outer surface membrane of E. coli using the ice nucleation protein (INP) of the Gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae 10 . INP is an outer membrane protein capable of imparting ice crystal formation on the supercooled water, with a deduced molecular weight of 118 kDa 10 .",

[4], was an inflection point in recombinant protein expression research and many reports have followed, exploring the system for a variety of applications [5][6][7][8][9].Until this recent increase in interest, the fast growth rate of V. natriegens [10] was one of the more notable attributes of this Gram-negative bacterium that was isolated from a salt marsh [11].Reports have attributed this fast-growing phenotype to the large number of rRNA operons, and thus ribosomes [4,12,13], or a higher level of substrate uptake [14].Regardless, V. natriegens might have some advantages over E. coli in recombinant protein expression.\n\nThe recent work cites fast growth rate, metabolic diversity, and the emerging development of tools for genetic manipulation as positive factors for the use of V. natriegens [15,16].Fast growth rate was also what induced our lab to investigate the use of this system for recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "E. coli remains the most widely used system for recombinant protein expression due to its numerous advantages over other expression systems such as yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems. The key benefits of using E. coli include its low cost, ease of use, and ability to scale production efficiently, making it the preferred host for many researchers. [14] urthermore, the flexibility of E. coli in accommodating various expression conditions allows for fine-tuning protein production to optimize yield and solubility, which are critical for downstream applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that altering expression parameters, such as temperature, induction time, and inducer concentration, can significantly enhance production efficiency and solubility of target proteins. [15] ur comprehensive search on the database, which catalogued E. coli-expressed recombinant proteins, included entries corresponding to 17 317 unique UniProt IDs sourced from 19 799 research articles. This extensive dataset provides valuable insight into the commonly used induction conditions across a wide array of proteins. For instance, in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), we show that the most frequently used induction temperatures are 18, 20, and 16 \u00b0C, which accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The induction times are clustered predominantly around two ranges: 12-16 h (69.0%) and 3-6 h (14.3%), with isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations commonly set to 1 millimolar or 0.5 millimolar. Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, specific conditions are favored to maximize the expression of proteins with distinct annotations. For example, proteins associated with \"disulfide bond,\" \"protease\", and \"DNA-binding\" annotations tend to be expressed under shorter induction times (2-8 h) and higher temperatures (28-37 \u00b0C), whereas those related to the \"cytoskeleton\", \"cell cycle\", and \"nucleus\" are less commonly expressed under shorter induction times. Moreover, proteins that bind iron or whose functions are iron-dependent are more frequently expressed at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h.",

            "text": "Cell factories have been largely exploited for the controlled production of substances of interest for food, pharma and biotech industries. Although human-controlled microbial production and transformation are much older, the cell factory concept was fully established in the 80\u2019s through the intensive public and private investment. Strongly empowered by the then nascent recombinant DNA technologies and supported by the approval of recombinant insulin [1,2], the principle of controlled biological production as a convenient source of difficult-to-obtain molecules (especially those of high added value) deeply penetrated the industrial tissue, soon becoming a widespread platform aiming at cost-effective large-scale production [3]. The first generation cell factories (mainly composed by plain strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae) were soon replaced by engineered variants. Resulting from the application of untargeted mutagenesis and phenotypic selection, conventional genetic modification, metabolic engineering, and more recently by systems metabolic engineering that integrates metabolic engineering with systems biology and synthetic biology, new strains having much enhanced performance have been progressively developed [4-19]. In parallel, mammalian and insect cells for the production of high quality proteins, and other microbial species appealing from an industrial point of view due to their unusual physiological traits, have been incorporated to the cell factory family [20,21]. This comprises algae, fungi, psychrophilic bacteria and moss, among others [22-26]. On the other hand, a set of food-grade lactic acid bacteria are under development as emerging platforms in food microbiology but also as a novel source of metabolites and proteins [27-34]. The physiological diversity of the microbial world offers an intricacy of biosynthetic pathways from which novel bio-products, including nano- or micro-structured materials [35-37], offer promises in even more diverse applications. \n \nStill, many substances and materials of industrial interest are nowadays produced by chemical synthesis, and the number of (recombinant) proteins approved for therapeutic use hardly reaches 200, a figure much lower than that initially presumed. However, both environmental concerns and medical and industrial needs strongly push towards a fully sustainable bio-production of a larger spectrum of substances. Then, how much limited is the economic feasibility",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins for human and animal health is a growing market dominated by antibodies, vaccines, replacement enzymes, and modulators such as hormones, growth factors and cytokines (Gifre et al., 2017;Lagass\u00e9 et al., 2017;Spiegel et al., 2018;Fischer and Buyel, 2020). These prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic proteins are mostly produced in microbial cells, such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or in mammalian cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), murine myeloma (NS0, Sp2/0) or the human cell lines HEK293 and Per.C6 (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Li et al., 2010;Dumont et al., 2016). All of these platforms have limitations in terms of process economy, product safety, and the ability to produce proteins that are toxic to the host. They also require a sterile environment and sophisticated process controls. The transient expression of proteins in plants infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens can tackle these issues because the production of plant biomass is cost-efficient and scalable, and the plants act as self-contained bioreactors (Buyel and Fischer, 2012;Buyel, 2018). Furthermore, plants do not support the growth of human pathogens, they can be engineered to carry out authentic post-translational modifications (Jansing et al., 2019), and they can accumulate proteins such as toxins that kill mammalian cells (Gamerith et al., 2017;Gengenbach et al., 2019). Transient expression in plants is also rapid, with even large-scale experiments requiring only weeks from gene to product (Garabagi et al., 2012;Shoji et al., 2012;Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2014). In contrast, the development of mammalian cell lines takes many months even before production commences. Finally, recent advances in the downstream processing of plant biomass have resulted in processes that closely resemble those established for other systems in terms of costs and unit operations (Buyel, 2015).",

            "text": "A protein encoded in recombinant DNA and expressed in a heterologous host is a recombinant protein (Young et al. 2012). In 1973, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen pioneered the use of recombinant DNA in cloning and gene expression processes. In the 1970s, the use of recombinant DNA expression for the production of recombinant proteins increased, and today the production of recombinant proteins has dramatically increased, and the techniques used in this science are available in all countries. Nowadays, some vaccines applied against COVID-19 disease are based on recombinant DNA technology (Francis et al. 2022;Ghiasi et al. 2021) and this technology will be a promising method to fight against cancers and incurable diseases.\n\nChoosing a suitable heterologous host for the expression of heterologous genes is an important step. Researchers have used different prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms as heterologous hosts, such as Escherichia coli (Rosano et al. 2014), Bacillus subtillis (Schumann 2007), Pseudomonas fluorescens , filamentous fungi (Ward 2012), yeasts (\u00c7elik and \u00c7al\u0131k 2012), insect cells (Ikonomou et al. 2003), mammalian cells (Lai et al. 2013), and plant cells (Hellwig et al. 2004). Each of these hosts has its own merits and demerits (Shanmugaraj et al. 2020). The selection of suitable expression systems depends on many criteria such as the facilities of the laboratory and local expertise , final production cost (Gifre et al. 2017), the characteristics of the recombinant protein (Demain et al. 2009), the intrinsic feature of the expression host (Palomares et al. 2004), the source of the heterologous gene (Deng et al. 2017), easy optimization of heterologous expression (Kaur et al. 2018), regulatory considerations (Hellwig et al. 2004), the purpose of recombinant protein production (Puetz and Wurm 2019), etc. Therefore, before the production of recombinant protein in the heterologous host, the ideal host for the expression",

This approach is favored due to its simplicity and rapidity in expressing foreign proteins. Moreover, it offers a high likelihood of obtaining biologically active proteins, further contributing to its popularity in the field of protein production [54]. Moreover, the resemblance of protein secretion pathways between yeasts and higher eukaryotic organisms has meant that yeasts such as Pichia pastoris (syn Komagataella spp.) are now also widely recognized as favorable hosts for the production of various recombinant proteins [55]. The extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins by yeasts simplifies the downstream purification process, making it more cost effective [56].",

High-level protein production can also lead to modifications in catabolism and anabolism, including adjustments of the energy generating system, the protein producing system, and cellular fluxes [11,12]. Overall, the cellular reactions caused by recombinant protein production are similar to the heat shock and stringent responses of E. coli [12]. Altogether, these unfavorable conditions and the limitation of cellular resources caused by high production rates often result in accumulation of damaged and un-or mis-folded proteins in the host cell [13]. Inclusion bodies (IB) sometimes form, depending on the specific folding behavior of the protein of interest; even small changes in the primary structure of a protein can influence its solubility [14].\n\nFurthermore, in plasmid-based expression systems, the cellular energy required for plasmid maintenance and replication may influence the process outcome. In some cases the applied systems encounter problems with plasmid stability, leading to plasmid-free cell populations. To avoid plasmid-maintenance and stability problems, genome-based expression systems that integrate the target gene into the chromosome have been established for E. coli [15]; however, plasmid-based systems are still favored in industry because the cloning procedures are simpler and faster.\n\nThe present work focused on evaluating the prominent and very strong T7 expression system (commercialized by Novagen), within the most popular E. coli hosts, using an industrial-like process set-up. Previous comparisons of different strains have investigated biomass yield, growth behavior, or mRNA expression profiles [16][17][18][19].\n\nFor recombinant processes the impact of recombinant protein production onto the host metabolism is of also of great interest, as the host-vector interactions during such harsh conditions are often complex and unpredictable. Here we transformed the B strain BL21(DE3) and the two K-12 strains HMS174(DE3) and RV308(DE3) with the pET30a plasmid (Novagen; Germany) encoding the gene for human superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.",

Bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, are usually chosen first, due to the abundance of tools available for gene manipulations and the simple process for protein production. However, bacteria are severely limited because of their poor capacity to modify expressed proteins cotranslationally and posttranslationally, in spite of recent improvements of strains. Yeasts have some advantages over bacteria. Recombinant proteins expressed in yeast can be glycosylated, but certain modifications are not possible, especially in the case of complex form of N-glycosylation.\n\nInsect cell systems are now popular and used widely to produce proteins from higher eukaryotes because insect cells have a similar pattern and capacity of cotranslational and posttranslational modifications as mammalian cells, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and protein processing. The insect cell systems include the baculovirus expression system and the stably transformed cell system. In the baculovirus expression system, not only cultured cells but also insect larvae and pupae can be used for protein production.\n\nThe silkworm, Bombyx mori, has been used for silk production for centuries and recently also for protein production, as a bioreactor. Since Maeda et al. (1985) reported the production of human \u03b1-interferon in silkworm larvae, using recombinant B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), the production of many proteins has been achieved. TORAY Ind. Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) used silkworms to produce two recombinant proteins for veterinary use. Intercat, a drug principally composed of feline interferon, for feline calicivirus infections (commonly known as \"cat flu\") was introduced in February 1994 as the world's first antiviral drug for animal use. Interdog, a drug principally composed of canine interferon-\u03b3 for canine atopic dermatitis, was launched in December 2005. Nowadays, recombinant proteins produced from silkworms are being investigated for commercial purposes.\n\nThis review provides an overview of the production of recombinant proteins using silkworm larvae and pupae and the improvement of silkworm expression systems by the development of the",

            "text": "The industrial production of recombinant proteins secreted by E. coli is essential in the biotechnology industry (Yoon et al., 2010). E. coli has advantageous properties, such as rapid growth to high cell densities on a low-cost carbon source, and serves as a platform for recombinant protein production (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Due to its extensive use as a model system, E. coli genetics have been extensively characterized, resulting in the development of numerous tools that aid in chromosome engineering, gene replication, and gene expression (Mergulhao et al., 2005). Recombinant proteins can be targeted to different compartments within E. coli, including the cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular space. However, cytoplasmic expression of recombinant proteins is challenging. Proteins expressed in the cytoplasm may be susceptible to degradation by cellular proteases or accumulate as insoluble inclusion bodies, rendering them inactive (Mergulhao & Monteiro, 2007). In addition, cytoplasmic expression of certain proteins can have toxic effects on host cells, leading to reduced protein yields or even cell death (Mierendorf et al., 1998). In contrast, extracellular expression in E. coli offers several advantages for the production of recombinant proteins, including simplified downstream processing, reduced host cell contamination, high expression levels, reduced protein degradation, and increased solubility (Choi & Lee, 2004). E. coli has two major secretory pathways, the Sec and Tat pathways (Costa et al., 2015). The Sec pathway, which facilitates the transport of proteins from the cytoplasmic membrane, was the first secretory pathway identified in bacteria (Beckwith, 2013). This pathway has demonstrated the ability to translocate proteins in an unfolded state, thereby facilitating the efficient export of target proteins (Crane & Randall, 2017). In contrast, the Tat pathway has the distinct ability to transport fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane (Choi & Lee, 2004). \n\nChitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132)",

            "text": "Microbial host systems remain the most efficient and cost-effective chassis for biotherapeutics production. Escherichia coli is often the preferred host due to ease of cloning, scale-up, high product yields, and most importantly, cost-effective cultivation. E. coli often experience difficulties in producing biologically active therapeutics such as Fab fragments, which require protein folding and subsequent three-dimensional structure development. This paper outlines the recent improvements in upstream and downstream unit operations for producing Fab fragments in E. coli. Monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab) are a rising class of biotherapeutics and their production has been optimised using coexpression of molecular chaperones such as DsbC or DnaK\u2013DnaJ\u2013GrpE, as well as strain engineering for post-translational modifications such as disulphide bridging. Different media systems such as EnBase and combining nitrogen source supplementation with low-temperature cultivation have resulted in improvement in cell integrity, protein expression, and protein refolding. The recovery of native proteins from insoluble inclusion bodies can be improved by adjusting refolding conditions, as well as by incorporating multimodal and affinity chromatography for achieving high product yields in purification. Recent developments summarised in this review may tune the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the near future.",

The products approved from 2014 to mid-2018 include 68 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 23 hormones, 16 clotting factors, nine enzymes, and seven vaccines (Walsh, 2018). Advancements in the area of recombinant protein production have changed the previous trend, making the yield much higher and the cost much lower, thus allowing the production of such proteins on an industrial scale and opening the door for the treatment of multiple diseases and disorders. \n\nWith the help of recombinant protein technology, expression of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals has been achieved using bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast, insect cells, transgenic plants, and transgenic animals (Huang et al., 2012;Ahmad et al., 2014;Merlin et al., 2014;Gupta S. K. et al., 2019;Owczarek et al., 2019). Escherichia coli offers a fast growth rate with high product yield. Yeast systems (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris) provide post-translational modifications (PTMs).

            "text": "for recombinant silk production have been proposed [152][153][154][155]. At first, the most viable production used transgenic silkworm (Bombyx mori) [152,154]. The insertion of the gene MaSp1 to B. mori showed the viability of large-scale production of silk in the animal [154]. Nevertheless, the use of this model limits the production to silk fibers and does not allow for isolated protein production, limiting its engineering possibilities. In response, research groups proposed the production of silk in bacterial, yeast, animal and plant systems. Of special interest is the production of recombinant silk in Escherichia coli.. Edlund et al. [152] forecasted that E. coli silk production may lower the costs (as low as $23 USD per kg) and reduce the environmental impact (with a minimal carbon footprint of 55 kg CO 2 eq. per kg of silk). Nevertheless, recombinant silk production in E. coli faces more complex challenges than the standard recombinant protein production, as silk protein is highly hydrophobic and tends to form aggregates, limiting its productivity and the amount of correctly folded protein obtained [155]. To overcome this challenge, Abelein et al. [156] mutated the N terminal of the spider silk protein subunits by inverting its general charge resulting in higher recombinant production yield in E. coli. This shows protein engineering potential for more efficient and less resource-intensive production of recombinant silks.\n\nThe major advantage of biological systems to produce proteins of interest is the possibility to manipulate and optimize their physical and chemical characteristics through mutagenesis, enabling genetic engineered processes. As an example, GFP and reflectins have been tailored to perform specialized tasks [111,141,142]. These modifications allowed new protein properties, which lead to new optical properties of the materials where they were used.\n\nDespite advances in protein production through biological expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems, chemical synthesis has emerged as an attractive alternative to introduce homogeneous and site-selective specific modifications in a protein of interest [157]. Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is the most efficient technique for polypeptide chemical preparation. SPPS involves numerous repetitive coupling reaction steps on",

This protein is involved in pathogenicity of V. cholerae through osmoregulation and transportation of small hydrophobic molecules across the bacterial outer membrane. It also functions as a facilitating protein to CTX toxin. Considering these important functions, it has been greatly considered for its protective potential as an immunogenic candidate (7). In the most previous studies, most proteins have been cloned and expressed in E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae systems (11,17,18).\n\nBecause of specific cytoplasm environment of the prokaryotic organisms, generally, these systems have been unsuccessful in cloning and expression of heterologous proteins. Therefore, there is a great need to further process the recombinant proteins and also to secrete these recombinant proteins out from cytoplasm (17). In spite of efforts and studies that have been done to overcome these bottlenecks of prokaryotic systems, there are still problems that researchers should deal with them (19,20). The Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells have also been evaluated as an appropriate host system for recombinant protein production, but there are some disadvantages such as probability of viral and prion contamination, expensive cell culture media, and purification problems which are remarkable problems of mammalian host systems (21).\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a host for expression of different kinds of heterogeneous proteins (15). In spite of its advantages as a host, in some studies, secretion of recombinant proteins into the culture medium of S. cerevisiae has not been observed (22). This state has to be followed by purification of recombinant proteins from cell debris which is not very cost-effective.\n\nReiser and his colleagues showed that proteins involved in amino acid or nucleotide acid metabolism expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are hyper-glycosylated (23). Romanos and his colleagues observed that some amount of recombinant protein which was Bordetella pertusis practin was retained in periplasmic space of yeast S. cerevisiae and due",

            "text": "The function of a protein is determined by the number and sequence of amino acids, which controls the three-dimensional structure of the resulting folded polypeptide. Proteins are therefore molecules of great complexity and near infinite diversity, making them suitable for many different applications. More than 300 protein-based medicines have been approved in the USA and Europe, and proteins account for almost a third of all pharmaceuticals in development (Walsh, 2018). Proteins are also widely used in industry, including enzymes used to manufacture textiles and chemicals and to process food and feed. Many other proteins are used as diagnostics or research reagents. The demand for recombinant proteins is therefore rising steadily, with a market valued at US$1.654 billion in 2017 predicted to reach US$2.850 billion by 2022 (Markets and Markets, 2017). Therapeutic proteins (e.g., antibodies, vaccines, enzymes, cytokines, and growth factors) account for almost half of this market, followed by industrial proteins (e.g., technical enzymes) and research reagents (e.g., antibodies for protein detection and purification) (Markets and Markets, 2017). Market growth has been supported by advances in recombinant protein production technologies, including the engineering of expression hosts, the optimization of upstream cultivation (e.g., bioreactor design, nutritional, and physical parameters), and the development of more efficient protein extraction and purification methods. Most recombinant proteins are currently produced in prokaryotic cells (mainly the bacterium Escherichia coli) and a small number of wellcharacterized mammalian cell lines, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Other systems are used in commercial processes but are less common, including insect cells, yeast, algae, and cell-free expression platforms (Markets and Markets, 2017). There are also several platforms based on plants and plant cells, but these have not been included in the latest market studies, indicating they have not yet commanded a significant share of commercial protein production capacity. Even so, plants as an alternative expression platform offer unique advantages, particularly when target proteins are difficult to produce in conventional systems, require specific qualitative properties such as particular glycan profiles, and/or must be produced on a larger scale in response to urgent demand.",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.",

            "text": "Yeasts can be easily manipulated genetically, making them ideal for recombinant protein production. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae remains the widely used yeast for recombinant protein production, there has been an emergence of other species of yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica, Komagataella sp., and Kluyveromyces lactis that have shown potential in recombinant protein expression [45]. Perhaps the most desirable attribute of yeasts is their ability to make post-translational modifications post-recombinant protein development, which increases the stability of the produced proteins [58]. Additionally, because yeasts are tolerant to low pH, they can be applied during the large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Table 2 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of different protein expression platforms. There is no doubt that plants are gaining traction as an ideal system to produce recombinant proteins. However, the commercialization of plant systems in this regard is not forthcoming. Although downstream processing and inconsistent product quality may be to blame, relatively low yields of recombinant proteins produced in plants have also been pointed out. Recombinant protein yield is indicative of the intrinsic productivity of the host plant. The three main targets of a recombinant protein expression system are low cost, high quality, and high yield [2]. The scalability and low cost of plant cultivation were expected to reduce the manufacturing costs of plant-based expression systems. However, this has not been the case, due in part to the low yields of plant systems as well as the product recovery and purification costs. While cell-specific productivity (qP), which indicates the daily production capacity of a particular system, has been reported for other systems such as CHO [62], it is extremely rare to find qP values quoted for plant-based systems. Compared to other expression systems, one of the limitations of plant cells is the fact that they are significantly larger than other cell types, such as mammalian and bacterial cells [2]. Due to the large size of plant cells, it is difficult to enhance productivity in suspension cultures by increasing cell numbers.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli), a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium, is an important research platform for synthetic biology [1]. Owing to various advantages, such as low cost, rapid growth, and ease of genetic-manipulation, E. coli can be manipulated as a cell factory for the production virus-derived proteins, antibody fragments, enzymes, lipids, and a range of other bio-products [2,3]. Of particular interest in more recent years is the use of E. coli for the manufacture of genetically engineered drugs, such as interferon and insulin [4,5], and in the development of recombinant human vaccines against hepatitis E virus (HEV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [6,7]. \n\nHowever, despite these advantages, there are several limitations in using the E. coli expression system for the manufacture of exogenous proteins [8,9]. To date, the synthesis of therapeutic proteins using the E. coli expression system at a laboratory scale have been based on plasmid expression, with an antibiotic resistance gene usually incorporated into the plasmid for cloning and stability. However, in large-scale fermentation, the structural and segregational instability of plasmids and the metabolic burden on the cells for high rates of plasmid replication have a negative impact on gene expression fidelity and host strain viability [10]. Additionally, the use of antibiotics carries considerable risk for public health and the environment [11] and thus must be excluded in the culture. Such high-density continuous fermentation using antibiotic-free culture carries inherent problems with batch consistency [12]. Finally, an additional concern with Gram-negative bacteria is the extra-membrane component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin that, in high concentrations, induces pyretic response and septic shock in mammalian hosts [13]. Therapeutic proteins expressed using the E. coli expression system can be easily contaminated with LPS and, thus, residual endotoxin contamination in recombinant therapeutic proteins is strictly monitored [14]. As yet, there is no efficient method to remove LPS completely [15].",

            "text": "(i) Large-scale production and formulation. The widespread use of phage lytic proteins as antimicrobials would require large-scale production and proper purification of these proteins. In this context, the two main difficulties that must be overcome for translating from lab-scale to large-scale production are total production costs and safety issues. Escherichia coli is the most common bacterium used for the expression of recombinant proteins, since engineered strains are well known and there are several molecular tools set up to work with this bacterium (69). Alternatively, high recombinant protein yields can be obtained using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris or some filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus awamori, Chrysosporium lucknowense, and Acremonium chrysogenum) (70).\n\nTo date, S. aureus endolysins have been purified mostly from E. coli, although it would be possible to assess other systems for their expression; an example is chloroplasts, which have the advantages that they lack endotoxins and have a low cultivation cost. Indeed, the endolysins cpl-1 and Pal, specific to Streptococcus pneumoniae, were successfully expressed in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (71). Moreover, a platform for expressing an endolysin against Propionibacterium acnes in cyanobacteria has recently been submitted for a patent (European patent application WO 2016130024). The main advantages of microalgae are low cost, easy upscaling, and the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of several species. Similarly, expression of recombinant proteins in plants is also a feasible alternative (72).\n\nAn important issue regarding proteins intended for therapeutic applications is the purification degree. Proteins must be highly purified, especially those to be administered parenterally. Suspensions of these proteins have to be sterile products obtained after a high number of phases, including centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and chromatographic steps, followed by sterilization by filtration and ultrafiltration. All these processes must be performed in clean areas (73)",

A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.",

To characterize such proteins biochemically and structurally, it is important to obtain substantial amounts of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative \u03b3-proteobacterium, is the most commonly used host bacterium for the largescale production of recombinant proteins. However, the expression and isolation of all the proteins in E. coli is difficult on account of the problems of insolubility, cytotoxicity, post-translational modifications, or inefficient translation.\n\nIn order to overcome these problems, host-vector systems other than E. coli have also been developed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Bacillus spp. (e.g., B. brevis and B. subtilis) and Lactococcus lactis are Gram-positive bacteria with low G + C content and are often used to secrete expressed proteins into the culture media [1][2][3][4][5].\n\nSecretion prevents the local accumulation of the recombinant proteins and this occasionally aids in correct protein folding [6]. Bacillus brevis has an extremely high capacity of protein secretion and is being used for the expression of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins on an industrial scale [2]. Lactococcus lactis can also be used for the secretion of recombinant proteins and these proteins can be used directly in food applications [5]. Eukaryotic cells such as yeast cells, insect cells, or immortalized cell lines are particularly useful for the expression of proteins that undergo post-translational modifications [7].\n\nIn actinomycetes (Gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C content), the genera Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, and Mycobacterim have received an increasing amount of attention, particularly in the industrial fields. They exhibit potential advantages in the synthesis of secondary metabolites of industrial and medical importance, in the production of amino acids by fermentation, and in bioconversion processes.

Success of this platform as a recombinant expression host mainly due to the ease of is attributed toward some factors such as wide choice of cloning vectors, rapid growth, inexpensive media and simple techniques required for transformation, secretion of heterologous proteins into the culture medium and avoid the difficulties associated with purification of the recombinant protein [9]. E. coli expression systems been used for recombinant proteins production both intracellularly and extracellularly. In spite of the many advantages of using E. coli as expression host, there are certain limitations such as upon gene over expression, recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. In order  to reduce the inclusion bodies, several strategies could be used such as regulation of the protein synthesis rate, co-expression of chaperone genes and empowering the secretion of proteins into the periplasm. However, the control rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by altering the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [9].\n\nAlthough previously it has been reported that the expression of the xylanase genes usually cannot be functionally expressed in E. coli due to some factors including the repetitive appearance of rare codons and the requirement for specific post translational modifications such as disulfide bond formation and glycosylation [51] and also it require N-glycosylation whereas E. coli can only perform simple O-glycosylation [52]. However, recently recombinant xylanase of family GH10 (XYN) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (DSM 571) was successfully overexpressed in E. coli (strain BL21) [53]. Similarly, another xylanase gene (xyn10B) encoding the endo-xylanase from Thermotoga thermarum, was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli (strain BL21) and exhibits the thermostability at high temperature [54].",

The success rate has been very high for bacterial proteins, but also a large number of simple, especially soluble eukaryotic proteins, have been successfully expressed in prokaryotic systems.

            "text": "A three-dimensional (3D) sphere cell culture system that does not require mechanical stirring or agitation was established using the properties of a polysaccharide polymer [1]. Moreover, 3D culture systems enable mammalian and human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and hepatocytes derived from these cells to float in the culture medium [2][3][4]. In traditional medium, cells eventually settle on the bottom of the culture dish due to the effect of gravity and may subsequently lose critical properties. Preventing cells attaching to the surface of the dish would help to overcome such problems and enable efficient utilization of culture space and resources. In addition, cells can be cultured on a large scale using 3D systems. Suspension cells could be potentially cultured in large-volume bioreactors using 3D culture medium to produce a large number of cells for industrial manufacture of recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins have many therapeutic purposes, and consequently several systems have been established for their industrial production. Escherichia coli has been used to produce recombinant proteins because it can be easily cultured and is amenable to genetic modification. However, the production of recombinant proteins using this system is hampered by a lack of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the risk of endotoxin contamination [5]. Recombinant proteins are also frequently produced in yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. Although yeast cells can be easily and inexpensively cultured, this approach is restricted by the limited number of yeast vectors and promoters as well as the lack of PTMs observed in human cells [5,6]. Production of recombinant proteins in animal cells is a promising alternative with various clinical applications. Animal cells need to be cultured for longer than microbial cells, and their culture conditions are more complicated. However, proteins produced in animal cells are similar to human proteins in terms of their PTMs (including glycosylation) and folding. Therefore, therapeutic proteins, especially those with complex structures, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as an example, are predominantly produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells [7][8][9].",

E. coli L-ASNase formulations are used as line first treatment and E. chrysanthemi L-ASNase is used as second line treatment [8,10,11]. \n\nIn the process of developing a product's production, it is necessary to find suitable conditions that allow economically viable productivity and protein yield [12,13]. A combination of the production of recombinant proteins and large-scale processes has enabled the production of enzymes in greater quantities than found from their natural sources [14]. There is a wide variety of expression systems for the production of proteins, among them are cell cultures of bacteria, yeasts, fungi, mammals, plants, insects, transgenic and in vitro animals [15]. The E. coli is one of the most used hosts for the production of non-glycosylated heterologous because it presents advantages such as well-elucidated genetics and physiology, rapid growth, low cost of culture medium and allows high levels of protein expression enabling production and higher production scales [16,17]. For these advantages, E. coli was the expression system chosen for this work. \n\nAiming at the scarcity of studies on the production of recombinant L-ASNase in bioreactors, this work sought the production of this enzyme in a shaker and in high cell density in bioreactors up to 3 L, in order to define a detailed process for the production of L-ASNase in E. coli BL 21 (DE3).",

            "text": "Prokaryotic hosts are generally the most used for heterologous protein expression, as they are generally easier to handle, have short growth times, and reach high cell densities in inexpensive media. Also, their genetics are often well characterized and increasingly large numbers of cloning vectors and mutant host strains have become available. However, they have important drawbacks, most of which are related to the inability of bacterial hosts to perform post-translational modifications, such as correct protein folding, phoshorylation and glycosylation, and correct formation of disulfide bridges. Thus, when post-translational modifications are not required, a bacterial strain represents the best host for the expression of a recombinant protein.\n\nAmong the bacteria, the Gram-negative E. coli represents the most widely used host. Different E. coli strains and a wide range of molecular toolboxes (i.e., vectors, promoters, tags) are commercially available to build up an expression system that is as suitable as possible for high-yield production of a correctly folded recombinant protein. In E. coli, recombinant proteins are generally expressed in the cytosolic space or can be targeted and displayed on the cell surface of the E. coli cells.\n\nThe presentation of the recombinant protein at the surface of the E. coli cells is achieved by fusing it to a carrier protein [151]. Recombinant proteins can also be secreted into the extracellular space, but this process is complicated, and therefore it has not been widely used [152]. As shown in Figure 6, about 52% of all of the recombinant lipase systems use E. coli expression. These include almost exclusively the lipases from the bacterial strains that belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Serratia and Burholderia, and from metagenomic libraries of different environmental samples. A few lipases from the yeast genus Candida, which are mainly represented by CALB, have also been expressed in E. coli. Lipases expressed in this host have been used as biocatalysts almost exclusively in biodiesel production (see Section 5.1). As far as phospholipases are concerned, more than 86% of all of",

            "text": "Sometimes, the production of cysteine rich cationic HDPs fails in bacterial systems such as E. coli, due to an inefficient formation of disulphide bridges that leads to improper folding and lack of bioactivity [40]. Another concern when expressing HDPs in bacteria is their natural lethality towards the host [41]. Therefore, switching to eukaryotic cells can be a suitable alternative to overcome this challenge, allowing for the heterologous expression of HDPs. Yeasts are one of the simplest eukaryotic organisms [42] and offer a good compromise between the higher complexities of eukaryotic cells and the relatively simple and inexpensive recombinant production of prokaryotic systems (Fig. 2). Besides, they grow faster than typical mammalian recombinant hosts such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) or Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells. And yeasts are free from endotoxins and harmful human viruses and can secrete large amounts of heterologous recombinant proteins with little host cell protein secretion, which can simplify downstream purification (Fig. 2). Exploiting all of these, a group from MIT [43] expressed apidaecin, an insect HDP, fused to human serum albumin (HSA) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. They obtained yields of more than 700 mg/L with no cell lysis and no debris removal steps required. However, because it is a fusion construct, downstream cleaving of the fusion tag was necessary. Fish [44], human [45] and fungal [46] peptides have also successfully been produced recombinantly in P. pastoris (Table 1), showing evidence that it can be a useful alternative to the most used expression system for recombinant production (E. coli). Saccharmoyces cerevisiae is another yeast-based system that has been used for the expression of HDPs [47,48], albeit less than P. pastoris.",

            "text": "The most frequently applied microorganism for AMP production is the bacterium E. coli [46]. E. coli has been shown to be the most cost-effective candidate for recombinant protein production due to its rapid proliferation, wide accessibility, well-established DNA manipulation processes, and comprehensive understanding of its genetics [51]. However, some hurdles must be overcome before AMP production in E. coli can be successful. Preventing the AMP's natural activity is the first step in avoiding lethality to the host strain. The second step is to overcome the AMP's instability due to its synthetic characteristics and size [52]. As a result, the AMP is commonly linked to a carrier protein with anionic properties to ensure effective expression. \n\nThe Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, in contrast to the well-known Gram-negative bacterium E. coli, is thought to be a safe organism [53]. As a result, screening resistance genes in B. subtilis rather than E. coli is preferable. Two fundamental differences distinguish the efficacy of antimicrobial gene screening in B. subtilis and E. coli expression systems. The first distinction is the host cell; B. subtilis has a natural potential to release proteins into their surroundings, often at high concentrations [54], which reduces host cell toxicity, whereas E. coli secretes proteins into its periplasmic space, resulting in a toxic state in the host cells. The expression vectors used in the B. subtilis and E. coli systems differ as well, with the B. subtilis system using the constitutive expression vector pBE-S and the E. coli system using the inducible expression vector pET-22b [38]. Despite the E. coli system's obvious drawbacks, the use of high-efficiency Bacillus secretion has been restricted to large quantities of industrial enzyme production. This approach has several drawbacks, including the difficulty of producing some mammalian proteins, protein buildup as inclusion bodies, and protease contamination from host proteins [53]. These limitations have been thoroughly studied for several decades, and we will demonstrate some of the strategies that have been proposed by addressing recent efforts to express potential proteins in the Bacillus expression system.",

            "text": "For the majority of researchers, E. coli is still the first host cell to be considered in any new protein production experiment; Table 1 shows it has been consistent in its usage for over 30 years, with the beginnings of a decline in the last 8 years. Large protein production initiatives such as NYSGRC 1 and OPPF-UK 2 use E. coli, insect, and mammalian cell-lines as routine yeast is still employed on an ad hoc basis and the reasons for that are unclear. Since individual research teams cannot typically afford the time and investment in the full range of available host systems, I propose that a laboratory with the ability to screen for the expression of recombinant genes in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and P. pastoris would be well placed to produce most target proteins; Table 1 shows that since 2005, 85-90% of recombinant genes were expressed in these microbes. Data from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (PDB 3 ) show that, for soluble proteins in particular, the probability of successful expression in E. coli is sufficiently high to justify its premier position in Table 1 (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). Complementing this, yeasts have the capacity to produce the most challenging proteins: Figure 1 strikingly demonstrates that the selection of a specific S. cerevisiae strain enables this type of bespoke optimization for a eukaryotic membrane protein tagged with green fluorescent protein that could not be produced in E. coli. The panels show confocal microscopy images with bright-field and fluorescence for wild-type cells a mutant S. cerevisiae strain selected from a global screen for high yielding strains (Bonander et al., 2005). Only the mutant cells produced correctly localized protein. More broadly, it is notable that for eukaryotic membrane proteins, over half of all the structures deposited in the PDB obtained from recombinant material were from proteins synthesized in P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae (Bill et al., 2011). This lends further support to the use of these eukaryotic microbes alongside their prokaryotic counterpart for producing the majority of target proteins.",

            "text": "The marvels of DNA recombination technology have revolutionized the field of biotechnology. Several hormones, antibody subunits, vaccines, enzymes, and interferons are being produced at the industrial level, in suitable expression systems, under optimized conditions. For recombinant protein production, a range of expression systems are available such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant cells, insects and animal cells, etc. Each recombinant protein has different nature due to which it requires different challenges regarding the expression system and production conditions. Every expression system has its advantages and limitations on the basis of which it can be considered or rejected for a particular protein production. Therefore, it is very significant to investigate the potential and limitations of several expression systems to choose the suitable one for particular protein production at an industrial scale. The optimization criteria of an expression system is evaluated on several factors such as productivity, efficiency, physiological characteristics, total cost, safety, convenience, and down-streaming conditions. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remained the organisms of choice to produce recombinant proteins for a long time, but now several other microorganisms are also being targeted to evaluate their efficiency toward recombinant protein production. Prokaryotic expression systems can be used to produce eukaryotic proteins as well however, the use of a eukaryotic expression system is preferable because it retains the structural, functional, and regulatory properties of therapeutic proteins. This review illustrates a brief view of a variety of expression systems, their efficiency, and limitations in recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "Different recombinant protein production systems were developed with the appearance of recombinant DNA technology [1,2]. This technology opened a huge spectrum of possibilities, from the obtainment of proteins difficult to isolate from their natural origin to the de novo fabrication of polypeptides of interest. Different types of organisms are used for recombinant protein production purposes, including bacteria, yeast, fungi, algae, insect cells and mammalian cells [3]. For proteins that do not need specific post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, bacteria display the best performance-cost ratio as recombinant cell factories. More specifically, Escherichia coli has been by far the most used bacterium, due to low production costs, and a myriad of engineering tools that it offers as expression system. Despite all the advantages, the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present in the outer E. coli membrane is an important drawback since the presence of endotoxin or LPS traces in recombinantly produced proteins produces undesirable inflammatory effects. Thus, extra purification steps, which are costly and low-yield procedures, are required to reduce or eliminate LPS from the final recombinant product [4][5][6][7][8][9]. In this scenario, alternative expression systems such as Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), which are LPS-free and are classified as Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) organisms by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have gained importance. The potential of this group of bacteria has been demonstrated with microorganisms such as Lactococcus lactis, Latilactobacillus sakei (basonym: Lactobacillus sakei) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (basonym: Lactobacillus plantarum), which have been used as recombinant cell factories [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19], presenting similar performance to E. coli in many cases.",

            "text": "Multiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

            "text": "The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and trans-differentiation have increased the hope for using recombinant transcription factors associated with cell-penetrating peptides to facilitate the conversion of different cell types toward specific cell types. In this regard, the following differentiation approaches has previously been reported: conversion of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) into cardiomyocyte using ISL1 protein (12), hESC into dopaminergic neurons using recombinant LMX1A factor (13), human fibroblasts into dopaminergic neural progenitor-like cells using recombinant Yamanaka factors (14) and human fibroblasts toward cardiomyocytelike cells via recombinant Yamanaka factors (15); nevertheless, the growth factors are still key elements in the production of different cell types. \n\nRecombinant growth factors are being commercially produced in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The most popular protein expression systems are bacteria (E. coli), yeast (S. cerevisiae), insect or mammalian (HEK293 and CHO cells) systems. Factors like: time, amount of needed protein, ease of handling, disulfide bonds formation and type of post-translational modifications (PTM) determine the type of expression system and host used to produce recombinant proteins. Technically, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli is simpler and could be done in a significantly shorter period of time (16,17). Expression of some proteins still needs to be done in eukaryotes because some expressed proteins in E. coli are not properly folded and they may require PTM such as glycosylation, lipidation, methylation and acetylation (18), or eukaryotic cells chaperons for correct folding (19) or tertiary/ quaternary structure formation despite its higher costs and longer time period requirement. Also, for protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies, recombinant proteins must be expressed in their original cell so the researchers will have a better understanding of proteins network (20).",

Aside from bacterial expression (Pizarro et al. 2010;Nguyen et al. 2016), several eukaryotic expression host systems have been employed for the recombinant production of VEGF, including yeast (Mohanraj et al. 1995;Kang et al. 2013), Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOs) (Lee et al. 2008), insect cells (Lee et al. 2006), transgenic rice (Chung et al. 2014) and silkworm (Wu et al. 2004). The most preferred system is Escherichia coli (E. coli); however, it exhibits drawbacks, such as the tendency to form inclusion bodies, protein misfolding and di cult puri cation steps (Nguyen et al. 2016). In addition, yeast and bacteria are cost-effective systems, unlike other higher organisms, such as insects or mammalian cells; however, unlike bacteria, yeasts do not require refolding for activity. \n\nKluyveromyces lactis (K. lactis) is an emerging yeast host for the production of heterologous protein. It has the ability to obtain high levels of protein, thus making it particularly suitable for industrial applications. In addition to being used as a host for protein expression, K. lactis has potential for numerous biotechnological applications, for example, as an infant formula component, protein supplement, avour enhancer, commercial enzyme producer, lactase and lactic acid source and probiotic single-cell protein (Bonekamp and Oosterom 1994;Belem and Lee 1998;Oishi et al. 1999;Colussi et al. 2005;Porro et al. 1999;Ghaly et al. 2005).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a 2 \u03bcm long, rod-shaped bacterium with a cell volume of 0.6-0.7 \u03bcm 3 . It reproduces through cell division by duplicating its chromosomal genes, or through conjugation and pilus transfer of its genetic material. As one of the fastest growing microorganisms, it has a generation time as short as 20 minutes in some of its sub-strains. Its growth can be driven both by aerobic and anaerobic respiration. While the aerobic growth is supported on a variety of carbon sources besides glucose such as glycerol, pyruvate, succinate and acetate [3], the anaerobic growth is associated with mixed acid fermentation metabolism. Here, also the metabolites from these pathways (e.g. lactate, succinate, ethanol and acetate) can be consumed by the cells but they exert inhibition of the anaerobic growth as well.\n\nMany important biopharmaceutical proteins are expressed by E. coli [4]. The first recombinant protein produced industrially was human insulin [5] which was followed by human growth hormone, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3-interferons, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), pertussis and cholera toxin [6]. The expression systems transferred by genetic engineering into E. coli are typically based on self-replicating multicopy plasmids containing the coding genes of the target product and regulated by strong promoters. One of the most commonly used promoters is T7 which can be either transferred into the cells using plasmid or directly integrated into the bacterial genome [7]. With this promoter the recombinant protein expression can be induced by isopropyl \u03b2-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). E. coli has several advantages when used for recombinant protein production. Its low-cost cultivation, well-known genetics, easy transformation, high cell density, high product yield and growth rate make it often a favourable choice [8]. The recombinant proteins are however formed without glycosylation. Thus, glycosylated proteins such as full-length antibodies cannot be",

However, if the usage of engineered E. coli, specifically designed to reduce IBs, is deemed unsuccessful; an alternative host organism may be utilized. Alternative eukaryotic hosts may have the correct PTM machinery, as well as an internal environment that is better suited to express and fold target proteins. Yeast is a popular unicellular host organism that can perform sufficient PTMs with their cell machinery (Malys et al., 2011). Many yeast species have been developed for heterogeneous proteins expression including Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Kluyveromyces lactis (\u00c7elik and \u00c7alik, 2012).

            "text": "Therapeutic recombinant proteins are exogenous proteins expressed in a producing organism and used for the treatment or prevention of various diseases in humans or animals [146][147][148]. Unlike artificially synthesized drugs, recombinant proteins are generally very large, complex molecules with specific mechanisms of action. Their size and complexity make the chemical synthesis of proteins very difficult, so these new drugs must be biologically produced using the protein synthesis machinery found in cells [146,149]. More than 300 protein-based drugs have been approved in the US and Europe, with proteins accounting for almost a third of all drugs under development. Almost half of the market is made up of therapeutic proteins (e.g., enzymes, antibodies, vaccines, growth factors, and cytokines), followed by industrial proteins (e.g., technical enzymes) and reagents (e.g., antibodies for protein detection and purification) [150][151][152]. Advances in recombinant protein production technologies, including engineering of expression hosts, optimization of upstream culture (e.g., bioreactor design and nutritional and physical parameters), and the development of more efficient protein extraction and purification methods are important market developments [19,153]. \n\nProduction using a plant expression system is both profitable and scalable, and an interesting alternative for the pharmaceutical industry; in addition, therapeutic protein production in plants has proven to be an attractive alternative to other expression systems, such as transgenic animals, cultures of mammalian cells, yeasts, and bacteria [47,154]. Plants have provided humans with useful bioactive compounds for many centuries, but it has only been in the last few decades that it has become possible to use plants to produce specific recombinant pharmaceutical proteins. Plant production systems are extremely attractive due to the lack of risk of contamination of the final product with human or animal pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and prions) as well as bacterial toxins. One of the first pharmaceutically important proteins produced in plants was human growth hormone, which was expressed in transgenic tobacco in 1986 [42,43].",

            "text": "Because the importance of protein phosphorylation for the proper functioning of cells and tissues is estimated, there is growing interest in in vitro phosphorylation. One of the challenges facing the biotechnology process of recombinant proteins today is to prepare a product identical to a native protein of eukaryotic origin using a cheaper and more extensive bacterial protein expression system. \n\nProper folding of polypeptide chains is an important prerequisite to obtain a protein in its native structure [3,8]. The key to the successful production of pharmaceutical-grade recombinant proteins is to identify host cells with maximum efficiency in the expression of candidate proteins that are safe and effective at a reasonable cost [9]. However, in many cases, the lower cost and less demanding production of eukaryotic-derived recombinant proteins in bacterial cells is not suitable [10]. Although the baculovirus expression vector system offers PTMs similar to proteins of mammalian origin, low protein yield finally results in a higher cost of production. Fortunately, plant, viral, or eukaryotic expression systems [11][12][13] are possible alternatives even if they are more demanding financially, and labor-intensive. For large proteins and proteins that require glycosylation or phosphorylation, mammalian cell lines (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary), yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, or transgenic plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana are suitable production organisms routinely used in practice. Compared to bacterial production cells (Escherichia coli) and without going into detail, this eukaryotic cell-based approach is more expensive and laborious or can lead to qualitative changes in protein structure [11,[14][15][16]. \n\nHowever, results published in the last 10 to 15 years showed that large-scale phosphorylation of recombinant proteins in vitro is not a routine matter [10,[17][18][19].",

            "text": "Over the last few decades, geneticists have learned how to manipulate DNA to identify, move and place genes into a variety of organisms that are quite different from the source organism. Since the 1970s, the establishment and development of the biotech industry has improved exponentially, allowing the commercial production of industrial enzymes and biopharmaceutical proteins. Since many proteins are of immense commercial value, numerous studies have focused on finding ways to produce them efficiently and in a functional form (Macauley-Patrick et al., 2005;Porro et al., 2011). In 1980, the FDA approved for clinical use the recombinant insulin obtained from Escherichia coli, becoming the first recombinant pharmaceutical protein to enter the market. Since then, the biotechnology industry has grown substantially, and currently about 25% of commercial pharmaceuticals are biopharmaceuticals (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012). Recombinant protein production is a multibillion-dollar market, comprising biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. Global sales for biopharmaceutical proteins reached US$87 billion in 2008, and are expected to rise up to US$169 billion in 2014. In 2009, out of the 151 approved recombinant biopharmaceutical products in the US and EU, 29 monoclonal antibodies contributed to more than 40% of the revenues, followed by vaccines, TNF blockers, hormones like insulins and erythropoietins (Porro et al., 2011). But to achieve a competitive production process is not an easy task. Any production process has to be highly productive, efficient and economic. The development of a new product or a new process usually begins with the choice of an appropriate production host; in this respect a comparative view on available expression hosts and their respective production processes is worthwhile (Porro et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Moreover, several purification steps are required to purify the peptides from complex growth medium, further inflating the cost of largescale AMP production.\n\nRecombinant gene expression could allow the more costeffective and consistent production of AMPs with the potential to scale up the production process.Escherichia coli is the most widely used host for producing foreign proteins, but this is hampered by the bacterial host's sensitivity towards AMPs [22].Furthermore, E. coli does not naturally secrete proteins into the extracellular medium, which can lead to insoluble inclusion bodies and the accumulation of non-functional proteins due to misfolding and a high rate of protein degradation by intracellular proteases [23].Different strategies have been investigated to overcome this, including signal peptides to facilitate secretion and fusion proteins to mask the activity of AMPs, thus reducing AMP toxicity to the producer strain and preventing proteolytic cleavage [24].Recombinant plantaricin 423 and mundticin ST4SA were expressed in E. coli by fusing the mature peptides to a His-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) [25].The fusion proteins reduced the bacteriocins' toxicity, but additional purification steps increased AMP production costs and reduced the yields.\n\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a promising alternative to produce class IIa bacteriocins as the cells are not sensitive to AMPs.It can also perform post-translational modification of peptides, such as disulphide bond formation catalysed by two enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), namely ER oxidoreductin and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) [26].The yeast does not require complex growth media and can efficiently secrete peptides extracellularly, thus increasing the protein titers and reducing the need for additional purification steps [27].Strains of S. cerevisiae are used extensively to produce recombinant proteins and enzymes [28,29], and a few studies reported the expression of bacteriocins in S. cerevisiae [30][31][32][33].",

For example, amino acid chains fold properly, disulfide bonds form correctly, and glycosylation occurs accurately as the protein is secreted. In addition, recovery of secreted proteins is simplified by the fact that cells need not be broken and the product may be a major species present in a minimal synthetic culture medium. The current state of the art permits the production and secretion of proteins by heterologous cells. While future efforts will be required to improve the efficiency of secretion, current methods yield commercially interesting levels of secretion from E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae, Aspergilli, and many mammalian cell types. Each of these systems offers certain advantages, and the choice of system depends on the specific protein to be secreted. High-value human therapeutic products such as plasminogen activators are reasonable candidates for secretion from mammalian cell lines, while industrial proteins such as calf prochymosin require a more economical host, such as baker's yeast or Aspergillus. The wide variety of posttranslational modifications observed in nature may prevent any single secretion system from dominating the field for many years to come.",

For example, amino acid chains fold properly, disulfide bonds form correctly, and glycosylation occurs accurately as the protein is secreted. In addition, recovery of secreted proteins is simplified by the fact that cells need not be broken and the product may be a major species present in a minimal synthetic culture medium. The current state of the art permits the production and secretion of proteins by heterologous cells. While future efforts will be required to improve the efficiency of secretion, current methods yield commercially interesting levels of secretion from E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae, Aspergilli, and many mammalian cell types. Each of these systems offers certain advantages, and the choice of system depends on the specific protein to be secreted. High-value human therapeutic products such as plasminogen activators are reasonable candidates for secretion from mammalian cell lines, while industrial proteins such as calf prochymosin require a more economical host, such as baker's yeast or Aspergillus. The wide variety of posttranslational modifications observed in nature may prevent any single secretion system from dominating the field for many years to come.",

Considering the factors like cost and toxic nature of IPTG, as an alternative, salt inducible Escherichia coli GJ1158 was used in this study for the over production of staphylokinase variant (sak \u2013 hirulog) using fed batch fermentation, cost effectively. Optimization of physico chemical factors viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources on bacterial growth for the production of recombinant sak \u2013 hirulog using batch and fed batch fermentation was studied. In batch culture, increased DO at more than 30 % did not influence the enhanced expression of sak \u2013 hirulog, but significant improvement was observed in fed batch cultivation. Supplementation of production medium with different nutrient sources like dextrose, yeast extract and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4) enhanced the sak \u2013 hirulog expression in fed batch fermentation process even without disturbing the cell growth by providing 50 % DO. Approximately 1178 mg/L of specific protein was obtained using cost effective modified glucose yeast exgtract (GYE) media devoid of sodium chloride.

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

However, research on E.coli has primarily examined it as a model organism, one that is abstracted from any natural history. But E. coli is far more than just a microbial lab rat. Rather, it is a highly diverse organism with a complex, multi-faceted niche in the wild. Recent studies of \u2018wild\u2019 E. coli have, for example, revealed a great deal about its presence in the environment, its diversity and genomic evolution, as well as its role in the human microbiome and disease. These findings have shed light on aspects of its biology and ecology that pose far-reaching questions and illustrate how an appreciation of E. coli's natural history can expand its value as a model organism.

However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486)."

Recent progress in the area of recombinant DNA technologies has paved the way to producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic reagents. Recombinant proteins for these applications are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, insect cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings. The development of efficient bioprocessing strategies is crucial for industrial production of recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance. Recently, advances have been made in the various areas of bioprocessing and are being utilized to develop effective processes for producing recombinant proteins. These include the use of high-throughput devices for effective bioprocess optimization and of disposable systems, continuous upstream processing, continuous chromatography, integrated continuous bioprocessing, Quality by Design, and process analytical technologies to achieve quality product with higher yield.

The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies.

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

There have been improvements on the transformation efficiency of 10 5\u2013 6 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid DNA ( 2); the best probably that of Hanahan (3) yielding 107\u2013109. The highest rates are achieved using electroporation (10 9\u20131010). However, we experienced difficulties in electroporation of the repair deficient strain of Escherichia coli (BMH71-18 mut S) required in the Unique Site Mutagenesis (USE) technique ( 4) and examined factors effecting the efficiency of the calcium competent protocol. It is possible to transform cells in a fraction of the time recommended and vastly improve efficiency. Mutagenesis protocols generally rely on a high transformation efficiency, but this is not of prime concern for the majority of cloning techniques. Standard calcium chloride transformations are simple, cheap and the competent cells may be stored at 4 C or frozen at \u201370 C, whereas Hanahan cells must be used immediately and electroporating equipment is expensive. We have concentrated on three E.coli cell types, JM101 for general cloning steps, BL21(DE3) for subsequent protein expression and the repair deficient BMH71-18 mut S. Cells were grown at 37 C in 100 ml of 2xTY medium (16 g bacto tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/l pH 7.4) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline or ampicillin where appropriate. At an A600 \u223c0.7\u20130.8 they were chilled on ice, pelleted, resuspended in half volume of 0.1 M CaCl 2, cooled on ice for 30 min, repelleted and resuspended in 5 ml 0.1 M CaCl 2 (5). Competent cells were stored at 4 C or as 100 \u03bcl aliquots in 10% glycerol at \u201370 C. The plasmid used was a 4.8 kb construct of human gelsolin cDNA in pKN172 (a 2.6 kb ampicillin resistant pET based vector) ( 6) . In the \u2018standard protocol\u2019, \u223c1\u201310 ng of DNA was mixed with 100 \u03bcl of cells, left for 30 min on ice, heat shocked to 42 C for 2\u20133 min, cooled again on ice before 500 \u03bcl antibiotic free medium was added for a 30\u201360 min outgrowth at 37 C and final plating out on selective agar plates ( 5). Using these conditions we achieved \u223c5 \u00d7 106 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid. The effect of salt concentration on electroporation has been well documented. Calcium competent E.coli were originally transformed using DNA solutions containing 20 mM NaCl ( 7), Figure 1 shows the effect NaCl has on these transformations. Optimum volumes for transformation were 8 \u00b1 4 \u03bcl DNA for 100 \u03bcl cells. Larger volumes reduced transformation efficiency: 30 \u03bcl gave 70% of the colonies obtained using 5 \u03bcl. The length of time that cells were pre-incubated on ice with DNA was not important. JM101 cells incubated with plasmid on ice for 1\u2013180 min before heat shock showed little variation in transformant numbers; at 180 min transformation was \u223c75% of that at 5 min. Transformations with BMH71-18mutS cells were variable and often as low as 20% of those obtained from the other cell lines. Incubation of cells with the plasmid on ice followed by directly spreading onto plates at room temperature (i.e. no 42 C heat hock) was sufficient to restore the higher transformation efficiency. When this was repeated on plates pre-incubated to 37 C the efficiency was even higher. Figure 2A shows results for JM101 cells incubated with the GS construct where the plasmid/cell mixtures have been plated directly from the incubation on ice onto agar plates pre-incubated to different temperatures. By spreading directly onto plates pre-incubated to 37 C we routinely achieve double the transformation efficiencies of the \u2018standard protocol\u2019. Once heat shocked to 42 C as in the standard transformation protocol, there is an indifference to the pre-incubation temperature of the plates (Fig. 2B). This figure also demonstrates that cells give higher transformation rates following 3\u20134 days storage at 4 C and can be used for periods of up to 2 weeks for simple transformation of plasmid, although in agreement with Dagert and Ehrlich\u2019s original observations they are best used after 24 h ( 8). Following 42 C heat shock, transformations were generally better with a 30\u201360 min 37 C non-selective medium recovery"

The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10\u00b9\u00b3 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli.",

In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.",

                "tldr": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of several host organisms used for industrial recombinant protein production, alongside yeast, mammalian cells, and insect cells. E. coli stands out as an economically advantageous system due to its well-characterized genetics, rapid growth, and simplified cultivation requirements. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nRecombinant protein production involves the expression of foreign genes in host organisms to manufacture proteins of interest for pharmaceutical, industrial, or research applications. Several expression systems have been developed for this purpose, with E. coli being one of the most widely used bacterial hosts. Other common production platforms include yeast systems (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), mammalian cell lines (like Chinese Hamster Ovary cells), and insect cell systems.\n\nE. coli has emerged as a preferred host for many industrial applications due to several economic advantages. As a prokaryotic organism, E. coli has relatively simple genetics that have been extensively studied and characterized over decades of research. This bacterial system offers rapid growth kinetics with doubling times as short as 20 minutes under optimal conditions, allowing for quick biomass accumulation and protein production. The cultivation media for E. coli are typically inexpensive, consisting of simple carbon sources and minimal nutrient requirements compared to the complex and costly media needed for mammalian cell culture.\n\nThe economic appeal of E. coli also stems from its ability to achieve high cell densities in bioreactors and its capacity for high-level protein expression, with recombinant proteins sometimes accounting for up to 50% of the total cellular protein. These factors contribute to higher volumetric productivity and lower production costs compared to eukaryotic expression systems. Additionally, the well-established genetic tools and expression vectors available for E. coli facilitate straightforward genetic manipulation and process development, further reducing the economic barriers to industrial-scale production. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nE. coli stands out as the most cost-effective expression system for large-scale industrial recombinant protein production, with economic advantages that span multiple aspects of the manufacturing process. A primary cost benefit is the simplicity and affordability of growth media. Unlike mammalian cell lines that require complex and expensive media components, E. coli can be cultivated on relatively cheap defined media consisting of simple carbon sources such as glucose, ammonia phosphate, and basic minerals <Paper corpusId=\"275819850\" paperTitle=\"(Casteleijn et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This fundamental difference in nutritional requirements substantially reduces raw material costs in industrial-scale production.\n\nThe economic efficiency of E. coli is further enhanced by its rapid growth kinetics and high cell density capabilities. E. coli can grow quickly with doubling times of approximately 20 minutes in rich growth media <Paper corpusId=\"52017139\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>, allowing for complete production cycles\u2014from inoculation to cell harvest\u2014to be completed in just hours rather than days or weeks required for eukaryotic systems <Paper corpusId=\"31546198\" paperTitle=\"(Francis et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221365459\" paperTitle=\"(Ma et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This rapid growth translates directly to higher volumetric productivity and more efficient use of bioreactor capacity <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Commonly, E. coli can reach 1-2 g dry cell weight per liter of liquid medium, corresponding to approximately 10^13 cells <Paper corpusId=\"52017139\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>, which supports high product yields in relatively small-footprint facilities.\n\nThe exceptional protein expression capacity of E. coli represents another major economic advantage. These bacteria can accumulate recombinant proteins in amounts of up to 80% of their dry matter <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7945842\" paperTitle=\"(Baeshen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This high-level expression, combined with higher production rates compared to eukaryotic systems, results in superior volumetric productivities that significantly impact the overall economics of manufacturing <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCost benefits also extend to processing time and resources. Mammalian cell cultivation is characterized by long cultivation times and requirements for expensive bioreactors <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, E. coli-based production is faster and more straightforward, with protein production routinely achieved in a single day <Paper corpusId=\"31546198\" paperTitle=\"(Francis et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. The overall simplicity of bacterial cultivation processes reduces capital expenditure and operational costs while increasing production capacity <Paper corpusId=\"27151161\" paperTitle=\"(Lundstrom, 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese economic advantages are reflected in the widespread industrial adoption of E. coli for commercial protein production. Approximately 29-40% of biopharmaceutical products approved between 2010 and 2014 were produced using E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"18974150\" paperTitle=\"(Marschall et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4563831\" paperTitle=\"(Kopp et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. The system is particularly economical for non-glycosylated proteins, where the benefits of bacterial expression can be fully leveraged without concerns about post-translational modifications <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221365459\" paperTitle=\"(Ma et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen directly compared to alternative expression hosts, E. coli consistently demonstrates superior economics. Mammalian cell production systems, while capable of complex post-translational modifications, are typically 2-3 times more expensive and time-consuming <Paper corpusId=\"14322255\" paperTitle=\"(Blanco-Toribio et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Yeast systems, while faster than mammalian cells, still present higher costs than E. coli and may suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation that can affect production consistency <Paper corpusId=\"57192905\" paperTitle=\"(Burdette et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. For proteins that do not require extensive post-translational modifications, E. coli provides the most economical option for industrial-scale production <Paper corpusId=\"237101690\" paperTitle=\"(Rigi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "In both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10\u00b9\u00b3 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli."

The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies.

Bacteria are ideal for the production of low molecular weight proteins that do not require post-translational modifications [37].\n\nBacteria of the species E. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways (Gopal et al., 2013)[36]",

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

This high biomass production, coupled with exceptional protein expression capacity, creates a powerful productivity multiplier effect.

Decades of research have resulted in well-defined transcription and translation systems, along with a wide selection of characterized promoters, making it straightforward to optimize expression conditions <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7900849\" paperTitle=\"(Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13702233\" paperTitle=\"(Drejer et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Escherichia coli is the most preferred microorganism to express heterologous proteins for therapeutic use, as around 30% of the approved therapeutic proteins are currently being produced using it as a host. Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

                            "In both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10\u00b9\u00b3 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli."

                            "Recombinant antibodies are used with great success in many different diagnostic and therapeutic applications. A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins."

The availability of a genetic map, gene exchange system, useful vector and transformation procedures, and metabolic pathways leading from raw material to the desired product are essential criteria for selecting a suitable host strain. The most popular organisms used to date for the expression of the recombinant proteins are E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Streptomyces spp, Corynebacterium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha and various animal/plant cells. E. coli remains an important host system for the industrial protein production from cloned genes as one of the main applications of genetic engineering in biotechnology. Various efficient expression vector systems have been developed, and a variety of mutants are available as host strains for different purposes (Favre-Bulle et al., 1991)(Sabatie et al., 1991). Overexpression of a heterologous protein is possible in E. coli, making it suitable for industrial production."

Currently, the most widely used recombinant protein production systems are bacterial systems. However, the limitation of the presence of endogenously produced endotoxins and pathogens in E. coli is difficult and, therefore, costly to remove from target preparations and creates additional complexities (Mett et al., 2008)."

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

These limitations often necessitate using more expensive eukaryotic expression systems for complex proteins, especially those requiring specific modifications for biological activity. (5 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile E. coli offers numerous economic advantages for industrial-scale protein production, several inherent limitations can offset these benefits for certain applications. The most significant limitation is E. coli's inability to perform many post-translational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, particularly glycosylation. This fundamental constraint means that proteins requiring these modifications for proper function cannot be effectively produced in bacterial systems. <Paper corpusId=\"237220817\" paperTitle=\"(Makrides, 1996)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16496697\" paperTitle=\"(Daniell et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nProtein folding issues represent another major economic disadvantage of E. coli expression systems. Human proteins expressed at high levels in E. coli frequently acquire unnatural conformations due to the lack of proper folding machinery and inability to form correct disulfide bridges. This often results in intracellular precipitation and the formation of inclusion bodies, where the protein is biologically inactive. <Paper corpusId=\"16496697\" paperTitle=\"(Daniell et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> The presence of inclusion bodies necessitates additional downstream processing steps to recover and refold the protein, significantly increasing production costs and reducing yields.\n\nAnother economic challenge stems from E. coli's secretion limitations. Unlike some eukaryotic systems that can secrete proteins into the culture medium, recombinant proteins in E. coli typically remain intracellular. This lack of efficient secretion mechanisms makes downstream processing more complex and expensive, as cell disruption is required to access the protein, followed by more extensive purification procedures. <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe bacterial endotoxin problem presents additional economic hurdles, particularly for therapeutic protein production. The lipopolysaccharides that constitute E. coli's outer membrane elicit strong immune responses in humans and other mammals, requiring stringent and costly purification procedures to ensure product safety for clinical applications. <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1585460\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nTranslation efficiency issues can also undermine the economic benefits of E. coli systems. Differences in codon usage between foreign genes and native E. coli genes can lead to translation stalling or protein truncation, resulting in low expression levels or loss of function. While codon optimization strategies exist, they add complexity and cost to the development process. <Paper corpusId=\"237220817\" paperTitle=\"(Makrides, 1996)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nDue to these limitations, certain valuable proteins simply cannot be produced in a biologically active form in bacterial systems. Notable examples include erythropoietin and anti-hemophilic factor VIII, which must be produced in mammalian cell cultures despite their higher production costs. <Paper corpusId=\"87012978\" paperTitle=\"(Kaliyeva et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> Even for proteins that can be expressed in multiple systems, such as G-CSF, expression in the homologous host (mammalian cells for human proteins) often provides a product with superior properties for end-users, justifying the higher production costs in certain applications. <Paper corpusId=\"87012978\" paperTitle=\"(Kaliyeva et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nWhile many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in non-glycosylated form and can therefore be successfully produced in E. coli, the economic advantages of bacterial expression must be carefully weighed against these limitations for each specific protein target. <Paper corpusId=\"237220817\" paperTitle=\"(Makrides, 1996)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "The many advantages of Escherichia coli have ensured that it remains a valuable organism for the high-level production of recombinant proteins (177a, 197, 254, 362, 406, 426, 510). However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486)."

While mammalian cells are necessary for proteins requiring complex post-translational modifications, their production processes are significantly more expensive and time-consuming than bacterial systems <Paper corpusId=\"14322255\" paperTitle=\"(Blanco-Toribio et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256211480\" paperTitle=\"(Blanco-Toribio et al._1, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cost differential between E. coli and mammalian expression systems is substantial and multifaceted. Mammalian cell cultivation is characterized by low volumetric yields, long cultivation times, and requirements for expensive bioreactors and medium components, all of which significantly impact production costs. In contrast, bacterial processes utilize inexpensive media in which fast growth and high cell concentrations can be achieved, resulting in higher volumetric productivities and considerably lower manufacturing expenses <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nComparative studies consistently show that E. coli delivers higher protein yields than mammalian cells while requiring significantly less production time and resources <Paper corpusId=\"14322255\" paperTitle=\"(Blanco-Toribio et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256211480\" paperTitle=\"(Blanco-Toribio et al._1, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This productivity advantage translates directly to economic benefits, as higher yields combined with faster production cycles allow for more efficient use of manufacturing capacity and lower costs per unit of protein produced.\n\nWhen compared to yeast expression systems, E. coli also demonstrates clear economic advantages. While yeast grows faster than mammalian cells, yeast-based production is still more expensive than E. coli and can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation that may affect production consistency <Paper corpusId=\"57192905\" paperTitle=\"(Burdette et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins."

                            "In spite of the development of multiple nonbacterial recombinant expression systems over the last three decades (yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cell, cell free systems; see Table 5.24.1), Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for recombinant protein expression (Yin et al., 2007). The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale."

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."
