Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the development of around 5% of all human cancers and HPV16 is the high-risk genotype with the highest prevalence worldwide, playing a dominant role in all HPV-associated cancers.

Cancer still has unknown mechanisms of pathogenesis, and its capacity to produce temporary or permanent damage, besides death, is very high. Although many anticancer therapies are available, finding a cure for cancer continues to be a difficult task. Thus, many efforts have been made to develop more effective treatments, such as immunotherapy based on a new class of tumor-specific products that are produced using recombinant DNA technology. These recombinant products are used with the main objectives of killing the tumor and stimulating immune cells to respond to the cancer cells. The principal recombinant products in anticancer therapy are immunostimulants, vaccines, antibodies, immunotoxins and fusion proteins. This review focuses on the general aspects of these genetically engineered products, their clinical performance, current advances and future prospects for this type of anticancer therapy.",

                    "text": "From the 1980s until now, advances in anticancer therapy have been remarkable and have represented new hopes for patients with malignancies and with a poor life expectancy. Immunostimulants, such as IFN-\u03b1, were the first recombinant products that nonspecifically boosted the immune system to attack cancer cells. In addition to individual use, IL-2, for instance, is being employed as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines to increase the immune response. Currently, many formats of antibodies and their fragments are dominating the market due to high specificity and good clinical response, whether used singly or in combination with drugs, toxins or radionuclides. Moreover, cancer vaccines are promising in spite of many studies that did not show high effectiveness in humans. Therapeutic vaccines are the most challenging, but experts are developing techniques to obtain better results, such as by treating the patient's own cells in vitro and reinserting the cells into the bloodstream. Thus, cancer immunotherapy is progressively more individualized and is approaching a future in which there will not be just one solution to cancer but rather many solutions to cure or prevent malignancies. These advances would not be possible without biotechnology support and especially bioengineering. Since the initial hybridoma technology was developed until more recent techniques, many recombinant drugs have been designed with more specificity, more effectiveness and fewer side effects. Furthermore, several organisms have been used to reach those objectives, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, insects and plants. Although there are only 21 recombinant drugs approved by the FDA for anticancer therapy, many more are in clinical trials and should be on the market in the next few years, inaugurating a new era in cancer treatment. \n\nin the development of these antibodies, such as the high cost and the long time between engineering and approval. It is also important to note that certain patients treated with mAbs can develop resistance, so the improvement of the in vivo efficacy of therapeutic antibodies continues to be a challenge.",

Pranchevicius, Thiessa R Vieira\n## Abstract\nCancer is one of the most important health problems because many cases are difficult to prevent. Cancer still has unknown mechanisms of pathogenesis, and its capacity to produce temporary or permanent damage, besides death, is very high. Although many anticancer therapies are available, finding a cure for cancer continues to be a difficult task. Thus, many efforts have been made to develop more effective treatments, such as immunotherapy based on a new class of tumor-specific products that are produced using recombinant DNA technology. These recombinant products are used with the main objectives of killing the tumor and stimulating immune cells to respond to the cancer cells. The principal recombinant products in anticancer therapy are immunostimulants, vaccines, antibodies, immunotoxins and fusion proteins. This review focuses on the general aspects of these genetically engineered products, their clinical performance, current advances and future prospects for this type of anticancer therapy.\n## Future Perspectives\nFrom the 1980s until now, advances in anticancer therapy have been remarkable and have represented new hopes for patients with malignancies and with a poor life expectancy. Immunostimulants, such as IFN-\u03b1, were the first recombinant products that nonspecifically boosted the immune system to attack cancer cells. In addition to individual use, IL-2, for instance, is being employed as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines to increase the immune response. Currently, many formats of antibodies and their fragments are dominating the market due to high specificity and good clinical response, whether used singly or in combination with drugs, toxins or radionuclides. Moreover, cancer vaccines are promising in spite of many studies that did not show high effectiveness in humans. Therapeutic vaccines are the most challenging, but experts are developing techniques to obtain better results, such as by treating the patient's own cells in vitro and reinserting the cells into the bloodstream. Thus, cancer immunotherapy is progressively more individualized and is approaching a future in which there will not be just one solution to cancer but rather many solutions to cure or prevent malignancies. These advances would not be possible without biotechnology support and especially bioengineering. Since the initial hybridoma technology was developed until more recent techniques, many recombinant drugs have been designed with more specificity, more effectiveness and fewer side effects. Furthermore, several organisms have been used to reach those objectives, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, insects and plants. Although there are only 21 recombinant drugs approved by the FDA for anticancer therapy, many more are in clinical trials and should be on the market in the next few years, inaugurating a new era in cancer treatment. \n\nin the development of these antibodies, such as the high cost and the long time between engineering and approval. It is also important to note that certain patients treated with mAbs can develop resistance, so the improvement of the in vivo efficacy of therapeutic antibodies continues to be a challenge.",

Although these technologies have yet to be applied to large-scale clinical vaccine trials, the large numbers of subjects in such trials and the importance of genetic factors in determining immune responses make this subject a logical focus of investigation. The judicious use of genotyping in human trials is likely to allow the identification of genes that determine responsiveness in human populations. Such information could be used to further optimize vaccines and to test and predict their efficacy in specific human populations.\n\nFinally, although the field of vaccination has historically focused on the prevention of infectious diseases, this technology provides a broader base for immune modulation of pathologic responses underlying other conditions. Recent studies have explored the possibility of using vaccination or immune intervention for the treatment of neurologic diseases, specifically Alzheimer disease, based on the ability of antibodies to reduce the formation of neurologic lesions in a mouse model of the disease 66 . A vaccine approach has also been developed for the prevention of atherosclerosis through the generation of antibodies to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) 67,68 . CETP inhibition might increase the ratio of high-to low-density lipoproteins; this more favorable lipid profile is found in individuals with specific inherited mutations of CETP associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Specific vaccine strategies have also been applied to a variety of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Finally, as noted above, the field of cancer immunotherapy has shown increasing promise as tumor antigens have been better defined, and the mechanisms that prevent immune responses to malignancies better understood. Better understanding of the basic molecular lesions and the delivery technology, as well as a more systematic assessment of human immune responses to tumor antigens will likely yield continued improvements in the success of these approaches.\n\nOver the last several years, advances in gene-based delivery technology arising from the field of gene therapy have helped revitalize the field of vaccine development 69 . There have been advances in the understanding of a number of viruses, and the methodology for making recombinant gene products, both of protein-and gene-based vaccines, has diversified and improved.

Nabel\n## Abstract\nAdvances in immunology and molecular genetics have accelerated our understanding of the genetic and cellular basis of many diseases. At the same time, remarkable progress in recombinant DNA technology has enabled the development of molecular and cellular treatments for infectious diseases, inherited disorders and cancer. This Perspective is intended to give a sample of the progress over the past ten years in cellular, genetic and immune therapy of disease. During this time, monoclonal antibody technology and cellular transplantation have begun to come of age in biomedicine. Innovations in gene delivery have not only catalyzed the nascent field of human gene therapy, but may also ultimately impact human health by advancing recombinant vaccine technology.\n## Vaccines\nproperties.\n\nUndoubtedly the field of vaccine technology will benefit from the sophisticated advances in genomics and bioinformatics. Although these technologies have yet to be applied to large-scale clinical vaccine trials, the large numbers of subjects in such trials and the importance of genetic factors in determining immune responses make this subject a logical focus of investigation. The judicious use of genotyping in human trials is likely to allow the identification of genes that determine responsiveness in human populations. Such information could be used to further optimize vaccines and to test and predict their efficacy in specific human populations.\n\nFinally, although the field of vaccination has historically focused on the prevention of infectious diseases, this technology provides a broader base for immune modulation of pathologic responses underlying other conditions. Recent studies have explored the possibility of using vaccination or immune intervention for the treatment of neurologic diseases, specifically Alzheimer disease, based on the ability of antibodies to reduce the formation of neurologic lesions in a mouse model of the disease 66 . A vaccine approach has also been developed for the prevention of atherosclerosis through the generation of antibodies to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) 67,68 . CETP inhibition might increase the ratio of high-to low-density lipoproteins; this more favorable lipid profile is found in individuals with specific inherited mutations of CETP associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Specific vaccine strategies have also been applied to a variety of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Finally, as noted above, the field of cancer immunotherapy has shown increasing promise as tumor antigens have been better defined, and the mechanisms that prevent immune responses to malignancies better understood. Better understanding of the basic molecular lesions and the delivery technology, as well as a more systematic assessment of human immune responses to tumor antigens will likely yield continued improvements in the success of these approaches.\n\nOver the last several years, advances in gene-based delivery technology arising from the field of gene therapy have helped revitalize the field of vaccine development 69 . There have been advances in the understanding of a number of viruses, and the methodology for making recombinant gene products, both of protein-and gene-based vaccines, has diversified and improved.

These libraries and one from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a single breast cancer patient were panned against three purified surface tumor antigens, such as CEA, MUC1 and ED-B domain, and against intact MCF7 breast carcinoma cells.ResultsApplication of novel display vector, pKM19, allowed isolation of a large panel of breast cancer-specific antibodies against known tumor antigens, as well as against breast carcinoma cells. Reactivity of novel scFvs was confirmed by ELISA, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. We demonstrated that seven of ten primary breast tumor specimens, obtained using discarded surgical material, could be exploited as an appropriate source for generation of phage display libraries, giving highly specific antitumor antibodies which recognize heterologous tumor cells.ConclusionLocal humoral immune response within tumor tissue in breast cancer patients frequently has an oligoclonal character.

It is known that various lymphoid tissues from immunized or nonimmunized donors, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes [11,12], spleen and bone marrow [13] and even metastasized or drained lymph node tissue from individuals with tumors [14][15][16][17][18] may serve as a source of specific antibody repertoire. Although na\u00efve antibody libraries are more diverse and lead to isolation of antibodies with broad specificities, it is reasonable to suggest that construction of a recombinant antibody library from the immunoglobulin repertoire of someone affected by tumor can provide antibody fragments of higher binding affinity against specific tumor antigens.",

Moreover, phage display also enables affinity maturation of antibodies in vitro through construction of mutant antibody libraries, giving clones of greater affinity [9,10]. \n\nThe possibility of finding high-affinity binders in a recombinant antibody library depends on its quality, which is dependent on several factors, such as library size, diversity and source of immunoglobulin genes. It is known that various lymphoid tissues from immunized or nonimmunized donors, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes [11,12], spleen and bone marrow [13] and even metastasized or drained lymph node tissue from individuals with tumors [14][15][16][17][18] may serve as a source of specific antibody repertoire. Although na\u00efve antibody libraries are more diverse and lead to isolation of antibodies with broad specificities, it is reasonable to suggest that construction of a recombinant antibody library from the immunoglobulin repertoire of someone affected by tumor can provide antibody fragments of higher binding affinity against specific tumor antigens.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have made impressive progress, providing great benefit by successfully treating malignant and chronic inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies with broadly neutralizing effects against specific antigens, or that target specific immune regulators, manifest therapeutic effects via their Fab fragment specificities. Subsequently therapeutic efficacy is mediated mostly by interactions of the Fc fragments of the antibodies with their receptors (FcR) displayed on cells of the immune system. These interactions can trigger a series of immunoregulatory responses, involving both innate and adaptive immune systems and including cross-presentation of antigens, activation of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, phagocytosis, complement-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The nature of the triggered effector functions of the antibodies is markedly affected by the glycosylation patterns of the Fc fragments. These can cause differences in the conformation of the heavy chains of antibodies, with resultant changes in antibody binding affinity and activation of the complement system. Studies of the Fc glycosylation profiles together with the associated Fc effector functions and FcR/CR interactions promoted interest and progress in engineering therapeutic antibodies. Furthermore, because antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes (ICs) have shown similar actions, in addition to certain novel immunoregulatory mechanisms that also reshape immune responses, the properties of ICs are being explored in new approaches for prevention and therapy of diseases. In this review, both basic studies and experimental/clinical applications of ICs leading to the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines are presented.",

Studies of the immune mechanisms initiated in cells by Fc-FcR interactions, have resulted in perception of the immune regulatory roles of antigen-antibody immune complex (IC) as a double-edged sword being revisited and studied in more detail. Despite their potential for pathological effects, ICs have been explored as preventive in addition to therapeutic vaccines, first in poultry breeding, and later in human diseases.

Furthermore, the recent development of a simple cellular assay of IC-mediated T-cell activation in vitro using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, may help to evaluate the efficacy of ICs prior to clinical trials. 95 Notably, due to the small dosage of monoclonal antibodies used to generate ICs, it will also be intrinsically less expensive to produce ICs than therapeutic antibodies. Furthermore, the tedious and expensive process of separately producing qualified antigen and antibody may be avoidable. Recombinant ICs can also be generated by fusing antigens with the Fc fragment of IgG into one molecule and expressing the construct in appropriate vectors. 96 This experimental approach has been tested using plant biotechnology and immunization in mice. 87 In addition, as shown in a recent study on allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and FcR activation, 97 more effective IC constructs may be generated. \n\nPreventive IC vaccines have certain advantages over the traditional preventive vaccines. However, due to the scale of the existing industrial commitment to producing the established kinds of preventive vaccines, application of preventive ICs may be limited to a few vaccine targets. In contrast, therapeutic IC vaccines seem to have a broader opportunity in practice. Combination therapy is the current trend for the cure of diseases and therapeutic IC vaccines may be given in combination with drugs, or other immune regulatory factors, thereby achieving better therapeutic efficacy than either of the treatments alone. Such a sandwich strategy using IC in combination with antiviral drugs and antibodies has been suggested. 98 lthough extensive experimental studies have shown the immune regulatory effects of ICs, the application of ICs in vaccinology has only just started. As IC therapy is mediated through immune regulation, and immune responses initiated by IC can be pathological, as shown by transient elevation of ALT in certain IC-treated CHB patients. Careful monitoring of side effects during IC clinical is crucial. More field/clinical trials are clearly merited to finally substantiate and verify ICs' contribution to vaccinology.",

Wen\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have made impressive progress, providing great benefit by successfully treating malignant and chronic inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies with broadly neutralizing effects against specific antigens, or that target specific immune regulators, manifest therapeutic effects via their Fab fragment specificities. Subsequently therapeutic efficacy is mediated mostly by interactions of the Fc fragments of the antibodies with their receptors (FcR) displayed on cells of the immune system. These interactions can trigger a series of immunoregulatory responses, involving both innate and adaptive immune systems and including cross-presentation of antigens, activation of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, phagocytosis, complement-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The nature of the triggered effector functions of the antibodies is markedly affected by the glycosylation patterns of the Fc fragments. These can cause differences in the conformation of the heavy chains of antibodies, with resultant changes in antibody binding affinity and activation of the complement system. Studies of the Fc glycosylation profiles together with the associated Fc effector functions and FcR/CR interactions promoted interest and progress in engineering therapeutic antibodies. Furthermore, because antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes (ICs) have shown similar actions, in addition to certain novel immunoregulatory mechanisms that also reshape immune responses, the properties of ICs are being explored in new approaches for prevention and therapy of diseases. In this review, both basic studies and experimental/clinical applications of ICs leading to the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines are presented.\n## INTRODUCTION\nInterest in antibody therapies has been further stimulated by the development of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against infections and monoclonal antibodies that target immune checkpoints for treatment of inflammation and immune disorders. Furthermore, rapid developments from studies on antibody structures and functions, from genetic engineering technology for mass production of proteins and from novel methods of applying therapeutic antibodies have further boosted interest. Studies of the immune mechanisms initiated in cells by Fc-FcR interactions, have resulted in perception of the immune regulatory roles of antigen-antibody immune complex (IC) as a double-edged sword being revisited and studied in more detail. Despite their potential for pathological effects, ICs have been explored as preventive in addition to therapeutic vaccines, first in poultry breeding, and later in human diseases. This review summarizes the background, the mechanistic studies on Fc-FcR functions, the translational research on Fc-FcR and the prospects of IC-based vaccines.\n\n## PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC VACCINES BASED ON IC\nWith the experience gained in producing ICs with HBsAg and influenza HA and their respective antibodies, appropriate ratios and methodologies for the manufacture of ICs can be standardized to fulfill the regulatory requirements for clinical application. Furthermore, the recent development of a simple cellular assay of IC-mediated T-cell activation in vitro using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, may help to evaluate the efficacy of ICs prior to clinical trials. 95 Notably, due to the small dosage of monoclonal antibodies used to generate ICs, it will also be intrinsically less expensive to produce ICs than therapeutic antibodies. Furthermore, the tedious and expensive process of separately producing qualified antigen and antibody may be avoidable. Recombinant ICs can also be generated by fusing antigens with the Fc fragment of IgG into one molecule and expressing the construct in appropriate vectors. 96 This experimental approach has been tested using plant biotechnology and immunization in mice. 87 In addition, as shown in a recent study on allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and FcR activation, 97 more effective IC constructs may be generated. \n\nPreventive IC vaccines have certain advantages over the traditional preventive vaccines. However, due to the scale of the existing industrial commitment to producing the established kinds of preventive vaccines, application of preventive ICs may be limited to a few vaccine targets. In contrast, therapeutic IC vaccines seem to have a broader opportunity in practice. Combination therapy is the current trend for the cure of diseases and therapeutic IC vaccines may be given in combination with drugs, or other immune regulatory factors, thereby achieving better therapeutic efficacy than either of the treatments alone. Such a sandwich strategy using IC in combination with antiviral drugs and antibodies has been suggested. 98 lthough extensive experimental studies have shown the immune regulatory effects of ICs, the application of ICs in vaccinology has only just started. As IC therapy is mediated through immune regulation, and immune responses initiated by IC can be pathological, as shown by transient elevation of ALT in certain IC-treated CHB patients. Careful monitoring of side effects during IC clinical is crucial. More field/clinical trials are clearly merited to finally substantiate and verify ICs' contribution to vaccinology.",

Giefing, E. Nagy, A. von Gabain\n## Abstract\nNew strategies are needed to master infectious diseases. The so-called \u201cpassive vaccination\u201d, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe\u2019s life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.\n## Introduction\nFollow-up technologies made it possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that are more or less identical to their human counterparts, employing microbial and tissue culture resources for manufacruring.\" During the last decade, monoclonal antibodies have infiltrated the therapeutic arena with great success and thereby provided a plethora of novel treatments against a variety of typically devastating diseases including specific cancers, autoimmune diseases and other pathological conditions.\" The common denominator of all monoclonal antibodies used in therapy is to bind to highly specific sites of typically well characterized protein targets and thereby intervene with biological functions involved in the pathogenic condition; e.g., to growth hormone receptors expressed at the surface of malignant cells. 14 \u2022 l s Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system , but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. 16 Progress in the identification ofspecific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that only contain single specific structures derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. The first viral subunit vaccine on the market that has become a great success is directed against Hepatitis B virus and based on recombinant protein technology. Alsopathogen-specific glycosides coupledto carrierproteins aresuccessfully usedin so-calledconjugatedvaccines directedagainstbacterialinfections; an example is\"Prevnar\" a registered vaccine againstPntumococcus. 17The successful development ofsubunitvaccines comprising isolatedmicrobialcomponentsas antigens has supported the notion that antibodiesper se, may suffice to neutralizepathogensin the body evenin a setting of\"passive vaccination\". So far only one anti-infective monoelonalantibody,whichisdirectedagainstthe Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (Palivizurnab), has entered the therapeuticarena.\"",

They are used in many standard assays such as immunoblot, flow cytometry, or immunohistochemistry. In addition this, the emerging field of proteome research has a huge need of binders against different protein antigens and splice variants (1,2). Moreover, recombinant antibodies are used for the diagnosis of different pathogens (3)(4)(5) or toxins (6,7). In the past decade, several antibodies for therapeutic applications have been developed (8,9), primarily targeting inflammatory or tumor diseases (10). In 2010, sales of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in the USA and EU reached 50 billion US dollars (11). \n\nFor the detection of different antigens, polyclonal antibodies are widely used in research and diagnostics. These sera contain a large and diverse amount of different antibodies with unknown specificities. However, polyclonal non-human antibodies may exhibit an immune response in human beings that hampers the therapeutic use for example after snake bites (12). Therefore, the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by hybridoma technology was a significant milestone (13) for the generation of antibodies for therapeutic use. As this technology is based on the fusion of antibody producing spleen cells from immunized mice or rats with immortal myeloma cell lines, its main obstacle is the inefficient immune response to highly toxic or conserved antigens. In addition, nearly all antibodies which are currently in clinical development are of human-origin or at least humanized in some aspect (9,14,15) to prevent immunogenicity. Consequently, Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin G; mAb, monoclonal antibody. transgenic animals, especially mice, have been developed which contain a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire (16,17) solving the problem of immunogenicity but not the need of an efficient immune response after immunization. Finally, in vitro selection technologies such as antibody phage display or ribosomal display provide a solution for the generation of human antibodies (18)(19)(20)(21)(22).",

However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with \u201chuman-like\u201d post-translational modifications. Furthermore, smaller antibody fragments including bispecific antibodies without any glycosylation are successfully produced in bacteria and have advanced to clinical testing. The first therapeutic antibody products from a non-mammalian source can be expected in coming next years. In this review, we focus on current antibody production systems including their usability for different applications.\n## INTRODUCTION\nToday, antibodies are used for several applications in research, diagnostics, and therapy. They are used in many standard assays such as immunoblot, flow cytometry, or immunohistochemistry. In addition this, the emerging field of proteome research has a huge need of binders against different protein antigens and splice variants (1,2). Moreover, recombinant antibodies are used for the diagnosis of different pathogens (3)(4)(5) or toxins (6,7). In the past decade, several antibodies for therapeutic applications have been developed (8,9), primarily targeting inflammatory or tumor diseases (10). In 2010, sales of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in the USA and EU reached 50 billion US dollars (11). \n\nFor the detection of different antigens, polyclonal antibodies are widely used in research and diagnostics. These sera contain a large and diverse amount of different antibodies with unknown specificities. However, polyclonal non-human antibodies may exhibit an immune response in human beings that hampers the therapeutic use for example after snake bites (12). Therefore, the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by hybridoma technology was a significant milestone (13) for the generation of antibodies for therapeutic use. As this technology is based on the fusion of antibody producing spleen cells from immunized mice or rats with immortal myeloma cell lines, its main obstacle is the inefficient immune response to highly toxic or conserved antigens. In addition, nearly all antibodies which are currently in clinical development are of human-origin or at least humanized in some aspect (9,14,15) to prevent immunogenicity. Consequently, Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin G; mAb, monoclonal antibody. transgenic animals, especially mice, have been developed which contain a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire (16,17) solving the problem of immunogenicity but not the need of an efficient immune response after immunization. Finally, in vitro selection technologies such as antibody phage display or ribosomal display provide a solution for the generation of human antibodies (18)(19)(20)(21)(22).",

The advances in antibody engineering have now facilitated a more efficient and generally applicable method to produce Fv fragments. Basically, scFv antibodies produced from phage display can be genetically fused to the marker proteins, such as fluorescent proteins or alkaline phosphatase. These bifunctional proteins having both antigen-binding capacity and marker activity can be obtained from transformed bacteria and used for one-step immunodetection of biological agents. Alternatively, antibody fragments could also be applied in the construction of immunotoxins, therapeutic gene delivery, and anticancer intrabodies for therapeutic purposes. This paper provides an overview of the current studies on the principle, generation, and application of scFv. The potential of scFv in breast cancer research is also discussed in this paper.",

Yeap, Abdul Manaf Ali, W. Ho, N. M. Alitheen, Muhajir Hamid\n## Abstract\nTo date, generation of single-chain fragment variable (scFv) has become an established technique used to produce a completely functional antigen-binding fragment in bacterial systems. The advances in antibody engineering have now facilitated a more efficient and generally applicable method to produce Fv fragments. Basically, scFv antibodies produced from phage display can be genetically fused to the marker proteins, such as fluorescent proteins or alkaline phosphatase. These bifunctional proteins having both antigen-binding capacity and marker activity can be obtained from transformed bacteria and used for one-step immunodetection of biological agents. Alternatively, antibody fragments could also be applied in the construction of immunotoxins, therapeutic gene delivery, and anticancer intrabodies for therapeutic purposes. This paper provides an overview of the current studies on the principle, generation, and application of scFv. The potential of scFv in breast cancer research is also discussed in this paper.\n## Recombinant Antibody Technology\nBeing a major part of the immune system, antibodies represent a powerful weapon system in defending our body against non-self-agents.But, to interact with as many foreign structures as possible, an enormous number of different molecules, bearing different specificities, are needed.This diversity can be produced through somatic recombinant and hypermutagenesis of a set of variant genes [2].\n\nDuring the past decade, advances in recombinant antibody technology have greatly facilitated the genetic manipulation of antibody fragments [4,5].The genetic manipulation of recombinant antibodies thus improved our understanding about the structure and functional organization of immunoglobulins.Further, these advances have led the development of a large variety of engineered antibody molecules for research, diagnosis, and therapy with specificities out of reach of conventional antibody technology.Once cloned, it is then possible to increase the affinity and specificity of antigen binding by mimicking somatic hypermutation during an immune response [6].It may even be possible to replace the existing practices of animal immunization and hybridoma development through a bacterial system capable of synthesizing and expressing practically unlimited quantities of antibodies to almost any antigen.\n\nSince 1975, Kohler and Milstein have introduced the hybridoma technology which enabled a defined specificity of monoclonal antibodies to be produced in consistent quality as well as in large quantities in the laboratory.Since then, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been favored as they can be produced in unlimited quantities to practically bind to any antigen and are more easily standardized [7,8].Besides monoclonal antibodies, hybridoma cells that are successfully produced could then serve as a starting material in the generation of Fab, or Fv fragments in lymphoid or nonlymphoid cells [9].Monoclonal antibodies face several difficulties, as they are almost exclusively murine in origin thus could create human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) when introduced to human therefore limits their clinical applications [7,8].Added to this, monoclonal antibody producing technology is very laborious and time consuming.Furthermore, small mammals like mice do not always provide the high-affinity antibody response to particular antigen needed for sensitive assay development [10].",

Hooper\n## Abstract\nBackgroundPreviously we demonstrated that DNA vaccination of nonhuman primates (NHP) with a small subset of vaccinia virus (VACV) immunogens (L1, A27, A33, B5) protects against lethal monkeypox virus challenge. The L1 and A27 components of this vaccine target the mature virion (MV) whereas A33 and B5 target the enveloped virion (EV).ResultsHere, we demonstrated that the antibodies produced in vaccinated NHPs were sufficient to confer protection in a murine model of lethal Orthopoxvirus infection. We further explored the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce immunogen-specific polyclonal antibodies that could then be combined into cocktails as potential immunoprophylactic/therapeutics. Specifically, we used DNA vaccines delivered by muscle electroporation to produce polyclonal antibodies against the L1, A27, A33, and B5 in New Zealand white rabbits. The polyclonal antibodies neutralized both MV and EV in cell culture. The ability of antibody cocktails consisting of anti-MV, anti-EV, or a combination of anti-MV/EV to protect BALB/c mice was evaluated as was the efficacy of the anti-MV/EV mixture in a mouse model of progressive vaccinia. In addition to evaluating weight loss and lethality, bioimaging technology was used to characterize the spread of the VACV infections in mice. We found that the anti-EV cocktail, but not the anti-MV cocktail, limited virus spread and lethality.ConclusionsA combination of anti-MV/EV antibodies was significantly more protective than anti-EV antibodies alone. These data suggest that DNA vaccine technology could be used to produce a polyclonal antibody cocktail as a possible product to replace vaccinia immune globulin.\n## Genetic vaccines for immunotherapeutic production\nDNA vaccine technology would seem particularly useful for protection strategies involving the simultaneous use of antibodies and vaccine, as the efficacy of gene-based vaccines are not reduced by neutralizing antibodies whereas the efficacy of whole virus containing vaccine can be impacted by the presence of antibodies.

Monoclonal recombinant IgY antibodies, in contrast to polyclonal IgY antibodies, offer several benefits. such as derived from a single B-cell clone, monoclonal antibodies exhibit superior specificity, ensuring consistent and reliable results. Furthermore, it explores the suitability of monoclonal IgY antibodies for low- and middle-income countries, considering their cost-effectiveness and accessibility. We also discussed future directions and challenges in using polyclonal IgY and monoclonal IgY antibodies. In conclusion, monoclonal IgY antibodies offer substantial advantages over polyclonal IgY antibodies regarding specificity, scalability, and consistent performance. Their recent applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research highlight their versatility. Plain language summary Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) and monoclonal antibodies: advancements and limitations for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy applications Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY antibodies) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are two types of antibodies used in medical applications. IgY antibodies are cost-effective, stable, and specific, with the advantage of not triggering harmful immune responses. However, they may have limitations in identifying certain target areas and availability. On the other hand, mAbs are highly specific and can detect multiple target areas on antigens, but their production is expensive and may cause immune responses. Despite these drawbacks, both IgY antibodies and mAbs show promise in various applications such as infectious disease diagnosis, cancer treatment, and autoimmune disorders. Ongoing developments in antibody technology are likely to expand their applications in immunology. This review provides an overview of the strengths and limitations of IgY antibodies and mAbs in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy, as well as their role in pandemic control.",

Some ongoing applications include Target therapeutics (IgY Monoclonal antibodies), R&D uses, & Diagnostic Applications. An interesting way of targeting cancer therapy is through the creation of recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. This comprises the use of antibody-drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These antibodies can attach to antigens associated with tumors selectivity, destroying tumor cells or activating the TherapeuTic advances in vaccines and immunotherapy immune system. 131 For instance, diagnostic techniques used to detect biomarkers for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular infections have resorted to recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. 18,30,142,143 In the absence of a chicken myeloma fusion-partner cell line suitable for chicken hybridoma production, two ways can be chosen for selecting monoclonal IgY: either the antibody library approach involving methods such as phage display, ribosome display or yeast display or single B-cell cloning. 3,30,144,145 Recombinant mAbs require less animal usage than normal polyclonal IgY's. This is because more animals are needed only before getting an antibody library ready. Furthermore, stable CHO cell lines' developed antibodies exhibit a short manufacturing cycle with minimal batch-to-batch variation. Recombinant TK1 antibodies can now be purchased. However, none of these serum biomarkers have been proven useful in health screening or clinical oncology yet. 107 Wang et al. 107 conducted their investigation using a new automatic chemiluminescence sandwich-BSA platform and found out that the Human Thymidine Kinase 1 (hTK1)-IgY-rmAb assay is user-friendly and suitable for large-scale health screenings. Antibody mimetics might become an alternative to traditional antibodies in different biomedical applications where they are simply ineffective. Ge et al. 146 revealed that antibody mimetics may find diverse biomedical uses, particularly when conventional antibodies fail.",

Shahein, M. M. Omran, Nahla Hussein, Asmaa El-Shershaby, Ana Petrovi\u0107, Marija Glasnovic, R. Smoli\u0107, Martina Smoli\u0107\n## Abstract\nDue to their high specificity and scalability, Monoclonal IgY antibodies have emerged as a valuable alternative to traditional polyclonal IgY antibodies. This abstract provides an overview of the production and purification methods of monoclonal IgY antibodies, highlights their advantages over polyclonal IgY antibodies, and discusses their recent applications. Monoclonal recombinant IgY antibodies, in contrast to polyclonal IgY antibodies, offer several benefits. such as derived from a single B-cell clone, monoclonal antibodies exhibit superior specificity, ensuring consistent and reliable results. Furthermore, it explores the suitability of monoclonal IgY antibodies for low- and middle-income countries, considering their cost-effectiveness and accessibility. We also discussed future directions and challenges in using polyclonal IgY and monoclonal IgY antibodies. In conclusion, monoclonal IgY antibodies offer substantial advantages over polyclonal IgY antibodies regarding specificity, scalability, and consistent performance. Their recent applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research highlight their versatility. Plain language summary Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) and monoclonal antibodies: advancements and limitations for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy applications Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY antibodies) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are two types of antibodies used in medical applications. IgY antibodies are cost-effective, stable, and specific, with the advantage of not triggering harmful immune responses. However, they may have limitations in identifying certain target areas and availability. On the other hand, mAbs are highly specific and can detect multiple target areas on antigens, but their production is expensive and may cause immune responses. Despite these drawbacks, both IgY antibodies and mAbs show promise in various applications such as infectious disease diagnosis, cancer treatment, and autoimmune disorders. Ongoing developments in antibody technology are likely to expand their applications in immunology. This review provides an overview of the strengths and limitations of IgY antibodies and mAbs in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy, as well as their role in pandemic control.\n## Recent applications of recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies\nIt is crucial to bear in mind that these applications are examples of continued research and development in the field and with advancing technology and discoveries, there are increasing opportunities for using both polyclonal IgYs and recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. Some ongoing applications include Target therapeutics (IgY Monoclonal antibodies), R&D uses, & Diagnostic Applications. An interesting way of targeting cancer therapy is through the creation of recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. This comprises the use of antibody-drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These antibodies can attach to antigens associated with tumors selectivity, destroying tumor cells or activating the TherapeuTic advances in vaccines and immunotherapy immune system. 131 For instance, diagnostic techniques used to detect biomarkers for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular infections have resorted to recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. 18,30,142,143 In the absence of a chicken myeloma fusion-partner cell line suitable for chicken hybridoma production, two ways can be chosen for selecting monoclonal IgY: either the antibody library approach involving methods such as phage display, ribosome display or yeast display or single B-cell cloning. 3,30,144,145 Recombinant mAbs require less animal usage than normal polyclonal IgY's. This is because more animals are needed only before getting an antibody library ready. Furthermore, stable CHO cell lines' developed antibodies exhibit a short manufacturing cycle with minimal batch-to-batch variation. Recombinant TK1 antibodies can now be purchased. However, none of these serum biomarkers have been proven useful in health screening or clinical oncology yet. 107 Wang et al. 107 conducted their investigation using a new automatic chemiluminescence sandwich-BSA platform and found out that the Human Thymidine Kinase 1 (hTK1)-IgY-rmAb assay is user-friendly and suitable for large-scale health screenings. Antibody mimetics might become an alternative to traditional antibodies in different biomedical applications where they are simply ineffective. Ge et al. 146 revealed that antibody mimetics may find diverse biomedical uses, particularly when conventional antibodies fail.",

The positively charged nanovaccines are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the lymphatic system often originating the cellular immunological defense required to fight intracellular microbial infections and the proliferation of cancers. Cationic molecules imparting the positive charges to nanovaccines exhibit a dose-dependent toxicity which needs to be systematically addressed. Against the coronavirus, mRNA cationic nanovaccines evolved rapidly. Nowadays cationic nanovaccines have been formulated against several infections with the advantage of cationic compounds granting protection of nucleic acids in vivo against biodegradation by nucleases. Up to the threshold concentration of cationic molecules for nanovaccine delivery, cationic nanovaccines perform well eliciting the desired Th 1 improved immune response in the absence of cytotoxicity. A second strategy in the literature involves dilution of cationic components in biocompatible polymeric matrixes. Polymeric nanoparticles incorporating cationic molecules at reduced concentrations for the cationic component often result in an absence of toxic effects. The progress in vaccinology against cancer involves in situ designs for cationic nanovaccines. The lysis of transformed cancer cells releases several tumoral antigens, which in the presence of cationic nanoadjuvants can be systemically presented for the prevention of metastatic cancer. In addition, these local cationic nanovaccines allow immunotherapeutic tumor treatment.",

Reproduced from reference [121]. Copyright (2022), with permission from John Wiley and Sons. \n\nDNA manipulation using recombinant DNA technology has been intimately associated with our understanding of microorganisms including the pathogens that cause many infectious diseases in humans [122]. The scaling-up of antigen production for subunit vaccines design can readily be achieved from techniques that enable us to read, copy and manipulate DNA sequences. \n\nA good example is the development of vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) as illustrated on Figure 4: three prophylactic HPV vaccines based on the recombinant DNA technology were approved and purified L1 protein self-assembled as HPV empty shells and induced production of specific neutralizing antibodies [123]. One should notice that not all antigens self-assemble to yield NPs in dispersion. In many cases the vaccine subunit design requires also adjuvant(s) and/or immunostimulator(s). The technique of DNA cloning signaled the birth of genetic engineering, which allowed the facile transfer of genes among different biological species [124]. Thereby, genes encoding important recombinant proteins such as insulin and growth hormone were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisae; hundreds of pharmaceuticals such as therapeutic proteins and antibodies, including the monoclonal ones, became available in the market produced by the biotechnology industry [125]. Recombinant DNA technology indeed represents a valuable tool also in vaccines development which contributed to the fast design of COVID-19 vaccines applied during the recent pandemics as discussed next. \n\nCationic NPs also played a fundamental role in the delivery of mRNA vaccines, as highlighted by their successful use in the COVID-19 vaccination [126,127].",

Carmona-Ribeiro, Yunys P\u00e9rez-Betancourt\n## Abstract\nCationic vaccines of nanometric sizes can directly perform the delivery of antigen(s) and immunomodulator(s) to dendritic cells in the lymph nodes. The positively charged nanovaccines are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the lymphatic system often originating the cellular immunological defense required to fight intracellular microbial infections and the proliferation of cancers. Cationic molecules imparting the positive charges to nanovaccines exhibit a dose-dependent toxicity which needs to be systematically addressed. Against the coronavirus, mRNA cationic nanovaccines evolved rapidly. Nowadays cationic nanovaccines have been formulated against several infections with the advantage of cationic compounds granting protection of nucleic acids in vivo against biodegradation by nucleases. Up to the threshold concentration of cationic molecules for nanovaccine delivery, cationic nanovaccines perform well eliciting the desired Th 1 improved immune response in the absence of cytotoxicity. A second strategy in the literature involves dilution of cationic components in biocompatible polymeric matrixes. Polymeric nanoparticles incorporating cationic molecules at reduced concentrations for the cationic component often result in an absence of toxic effects. The progress in vaccinology against cancer involves in situ designs for cationic nanovaccines. The lysis of transformed cancer cells releases several tumoral antigens, which in the presence of cationic nanoadjuvants can be systemically presented for the prevention of metastatic cancer. In addition, these local cationic nanovaccines allow immunotherapeutic tumor treatment.\n## Cationic Nanostructures in Vaccine Design Against Infections\nOn step 6, na\u00efve B cell interacts with VLP (from the blood stream) or DC via B cell receptor (BCR). With help of Th2, the B cell differentiation into plasma B cells occurs; the plasma B cells account for active release of antibodies in humoral immune response; in addition, differentiation into memory B cells also takes place, being responsible for the long-lasting antibody production.

The scaling-up of antigen production for subunit vaccines design can readily be achieved from techniques that enable us to read, copy and manipulate DNA sequences. \n\nA good example is the development of vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) as illustrated on Figure 4: three prophylactic HPV vaccines based on the recombinant DNA technology were approved and purified L1 protein self-assembled as HPV empty shells and induced production of specific neutralizing antibodies [123]. One should notice that not all antigens self-assemble to yield NPs in dispersion. In many cases the vaccine subunit design requires also adjuvant(s) and/or immunostimulator(s). The technique of DNA cloning signaled the birth of genetic engineering, which allowed the facile transfer of genes among different biological species [124]. Thereby, genes encoding important recombinant proteins such as insulin and growth hormone were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisae; hundreds of pharmaceuticals such as therapeutic proteins and antibodies, including the monoclonal ones, became available in the market produced by the biotechnology industry [125]. Recombinant DNA technology indeed represents a valuable tool also in vaccines development which contributed to the fast design of COVID-19 vaccines applied during the recent pandemics as discussed next. \n\nCationic NPs also played a fundamental role in the delivery of mRNA vaccines, as highlighted by their successful use in the COVID-19 vaccination [126,127].",

            "abstract": "Introduction The mpox disease, caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), has become a rising public health issue due to its potential to cause outbreaks. Consistently, this investigation aims to evaluate the current advances in the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches against MPXV, which are crucial for preventing and controlling mpox spread. Methods This scoping review was performed by analyzing the content of English-language articles published between 2018 and 2024, which reported the development of next-generation vaccines against MPXV and their assessment in animal models. Patents within the scope of this research were also included. Contrarywise, studies based solely on immunoinformatic methods, reviews, book chapters, news, and others were excluded. The literature search was executed in 11 databases, such as Scopus, MEDLINE, and PubMed. Results A total of 36 records (32 studies and 4 patents) were included in this review. All 32 articles contain preclinical studies with varied group sizes (4\u201316) in which the main animal models were BALB/c mice. Less commonly used models included CAST/Ei mice and cynomolgus macaques. Moreover, most vaccines targeted one or more MPXV antigens, such as A29L, A35R, B6R, and M1R, through active immunization (via mRNAs or recombinant antigens) or passive immunization (antibody delivery). Conclusion Overall, new generation vaccines might represent prospective candidates to combat the mpox health concern. Nonetheless, several of the analyzed studies possess drawbacks, including animal models with limited similarity to humans, small group sizes, and brief follow-up durations. Consequently, additional research is required to ascertain the long-term protection, efficacy, and safety of these immunotherapeutic approaches.",

                    "text": "In the search for innovative vaccine strategies, passive immunization has emerged as a promising yet underexplored approach. Instead of prompting the body to produce its own immune response, this strategy involves administering antibodies directly, thus offering immediate protection against infections, particularly in high-risk populations (Tharmalingam et al., 2022). These antibodies are often generated through recombinant approaches, allowing precise targeting of viral antigens. Platforms like CHO cells and plant expression systems are commonly used to produce these recombinant antibodies at a large scale (Pirkalkhoran et al., 2023). Alternatively, the hybridoma technique is also a common method for producing monoclonal antibodies. It involves fusing B lymphocytes from an immunized animal with myeloma cells, creating hybrid cells known as \"hybridomas.\" Once the desired antibody-secreting clones are identified, they are cultured to continuously proliferate, enabling large-scale production for clinical applications (Moraes et al., 2021). In spite of the potential of antibody-centered platforms for combating viral diseases, only a few studies have been conducted on the development of this type of immunotherapy against mpox. \n\nA vaccine type based on passive immunization was developed by Li M. et al. (2023). After identifying that the monoclonal antibodies 3A1, 2D1, and 9F8 bind to A29L, they proceeded to produce those antibodies through hybridoma technology. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the antibodies was evaluated by administering monoclonal antibodies to mice and challenging them with VACV TT and VACV WR strains. The challenge occurred either 1 day after prophylactic administration (before infection) or following therapeutic administration (after infection). Interestingly, 9F8 displayed the highest neutralization activity and demonstrated full protective activity, while 3A1 and 2D1 showed partial protection in some groups, indicating that the antibody 9F8 could be considered in forthcoming immunotherapeutic trials against MPXV. Zhao et al. (2024) investigated the use of monoclonal antibodies to target specific antigens of MPXV.",

                    "text": "Recombinant antigens have become a key component in the development of next-generation vaccines, particularly in response to emerging infectious diseases such as mpox. These antigens are produced by expressing viral proteins in platforms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, insect cells, or mammalian cell lines like CHO cells (de Pinho Favaro et al., 2022). Once purified, these proteins serve as antigens that stimulate the immune system to recognize and respond to the infectious agent. Intriguingly, recombinant antigen technology is advantageous in vaccine production due to its scalability, high yields, and costeffectiveness (Khalid et al., 2024). \n\nA recombinant vaccine targeting antigens from MPXV was developed by Gao et al. (2023). Their first assessment aimed to determine whether vaccination with MVA could induce antibodies that cross-react with antigens from MPXV. The experiment was conducted on BALB/c mice that received two doses of MVA on days 0 and 21 at different viral concentrations, including 10 5 TCID 50 /mL, 10 6 TCID 50 /mL, or 10 7 TCID 50 /mL. Researchers collected serum samples from the vaccinated mice, as those samples contained the antibodies produced after MVA immunization. The serum from the MVA-immunized mice was used in ELISA assays in order to test if the antibodies would bind to A29, A35, B6, H3, I1 and M1 despite the fact that MVA does not express these specific antigens. These results suggest that given the high similarity between MVA and MPXV, the neutralizing antibody response induced by MVA immunization is likely to cross-react with MPXV. Additionally, the highest immune responses occurred with the 10 7 TCID 50 /mL concentration (the highest dose) (Gao et al., 2023). \n\nIn the second phase of the study (Gao et al., 2023), recombinant versions of MPXV antigens were synthesized using CHO cells. Although M1 and A29 elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses, researchers decided to include other antigens such as A35, B6, H3 and I1 for further investigation.",

Duttaroy, Sujay Paul\n## Abstract\nIntroduction The mpox disease, caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), has become a rising public health issue due to its potential to cause outbreaks. Consistently, this investigation aims to evaluate the current advances in the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches against MPXV, which are crucial for preventing and controlling mpox spread. Methods This scoping review was performed by analyzing the content of English-language articles published between 2018 and 2024, which reported the development of next-generation vaccines against MPXV and their assessment in animal models. Patents within the scope of this research were also included. Contrarywise, studies based solely on immunoinformatic methods, reviews, book chapters, news, and others were excluded. The literature search was executed in 11 databases, such as Scopus, MEDLINE, and PubMed. Results A total of 36 records (32 studies and 4 patents) were included in this review. All 32 articles contain preclinical studies with varied group sizes (4\u201316) in which the main animal models were BALB/c mice. Less commonly used models included CAST/Ei mice and cynomolgus macaques. Moreover, most vaccines targeted one or more MPXV antigens, such as A29L, A35R, B6R, and M1R, through active immunization (via mRNAs or recombinant antigens) or passive immunization (antibody delivery). Conclusion Overall, new generation vaccines might represent prospective candidates to combat the mpox health concern. Nonetheless, several of the analyzed studies possess drawbacks, including animal models with limited similarity to humans, small group sizes, and brief follow-up durations. Consequently, additional research is required to ascertain the long-term protection, efficacy, and safety of these immunotherapeutic approaches.\n## Vaccines based on recombinant MPXV antigens\nRecombinant antigens have become a key component in the development of next-generation vaccines, particularly in response to emerging infectious diseases such as mpox. These antigens are produced by expressing viral proteins in platforms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, insect cells, or mammalian cell lines like CHO cells (de Pinho Favaro et al., 2022). Once purified, these proteins serve as antigens that stimulate the immune system to recognize and respond to the infectious agent. Intriguingly, recombinant antigen technology is advantageous in vaccine production due to its scalability, high yields, and costeffectiveness (Khalid et al., 2024). \n\nA recombinant vaccine targeting antigens from MPXV was developed by Gao et al. (2023). Their first assessment aimed to determine whether vaccination with MVA could induce antibodies that cross-react with antigens from MPXV. The experiment was conducted on BALB/c mice that received two doses of MVA on days 0 and 21 at different viral concentrations, including 10 5 TCID 50 /mL, 10 6 TCID 50 /mL, or 10 7 TCID 50 /mL. Researchers collected serum samples from the vaccinated mice, as those samples contained the antibodies produced after MVA immunization. The serum from the MVA-immunized mice was used in ELISA assays in order to test if the antibodies would bind to A29, A35, B6, H3, I1 and M1 despite the fact that MVA does not express these specific antigens. These results suggest that given the high similarity between MVA and MPXV, the neutralizing antibody response induced by MVA immunization is likely to cross-react with MPXV. Additionally, the highest immune responses occurred with the 10 7 TCID 50 /mL concentration (the highest dose) (Gao et al., 2023). \n\nIn the second phase of the study (Gao et al., 2023), recombinant versions of MPXV antigens were synthesized using CHO cells. Although M1 and A29 elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses, researchers decided to include other antigens such as A35, B6, H3 and I1 for further investigation.\n\n## Antibodies targeting MPXV antigens\nIn the search for innovative vaccine strategies, passive immunization has emerged as a promising yet underexplored approach. Instead of prompting the body to produce its own immune response, this strategy involves administering antibodies directly, thus offering immediate protection against infections, particularly in high-risk populations (Tharmalingam et al., 2022). These antibodies are often generated through recombinant approaches, allowing precise targeting of viral antigens. Platforms like CHO cells and plant expression systems are commonly used to produce these recombinant antibodies at a large scale (Pirkalkhoran et al., 2023). Alternatively, the hybridoma technique is also a common method for producing monoclonal antibodies. It involves fusing B lymphocytes from an immunized animal with myeloma cells, creating hybrid cells known as \"hybridomas.\" Once the desired antibody-secreting clones are identified, they are cultured to continuously proliferate, enabling large-scale production for clinical applications (Moraes et al., 2021). In spite of the potential of antibody-centered platforms for combating viral diseases, only a few studies have been conducted on the development of this type of immunotherapy against mpox. \n\nA vaccine type based on passive immunization was developed by Li M. et al. (2023). After identifying that the monoclonal antibodies 3A1, 2D1, and 9F8 bind to A29L, they proceeded to produce those antibodies through hybridoma technology. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the antibodies was evaluated by administering monoclonal antibodies to mice and challenging them with VACV TT and VACV WR strains. The challenge occurred either 1 day after prophylactic administration (before infection) or following therapeutic administration (after infection). Interestingly, 9F8 displayed the highest neutralization activity and demonstrated full protective activity, while 3A1 and 2D1 showed partial protection in some groups, indicating that the antibody 9F8 could be considered in forthcoming immunotherapeutic trials against MPXV. Zhao et al. (2024) investigated the use of monoclonal antibodies to target specific antigens of MPXV.",

            "abstract": "In the realm of cancer immunotherapy, a profound evolution has ushered in sophisticated strategies that encompass both traditional cancer vaccines and emerging viral vaccines. This comprehensive Review offers an in-depth exploration of the methodologies, clinical applications, success stories, and future prospects of these approaches. Traditional cancer vaccines have undergone significant advancements utilizing diverse modalities such as proteins, peptides, and dendritic cells. More recent innovations have focused on the physiological mechanisms enabling the human body to recognize and combat precancerous and malignant cells, introducing specific markers like peptide-based anticancer vaccines targeting tumor-associated antigens. Moreover, cancer viral vaccines, leveraging engineered viruses to stimulate immune responses against specific antigens, exhibit substantial promise in inducing robust and enduring immunity. Integration with complementary therapeutic methods, including monoclonal antibodies, adjuvants, and radiation therapy, has not only improved survival rates but also deepened our understanding of viral virulence. Recent strides in vaccine design, encompassing oncolytic viruses, virus-like particles, and viral vectors, mark the frontier of innovation. While these advances hold immense potential, critical challenges must be addressed, such as strategies for immune evasion, potential off-target effects, and the optimization of viral genomes. In the landscape of immunotherapy, noteworthy innovations take the spotlight from the use of immunomodulatory agents for the enhancement of innate and adaptive immune collaboration. The emergence of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as precision tools for cancer therapy is particularly exciting. With a focus on various cancers, from melanoma to formidable solid tumors, this Review critically assesses types of cancer vaccines, mechanisms, barriers in vaccine therapy, vaccine efficacy, safety profiles, and immune-related adverse events, providing a nuanced perspective on the underlying mechanisms involving cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. The Review also underscores the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies such as clinical studies, molecular sequencing, and artificial intelligence in advancing the field of cancer vaccines. These tools not only expedite progress but also emphasize the multidimensional and rapidly evolving nature of this research, affirming its profound significance in the broader context of cancer therapy.",

                    "text": "The past decade has marked a transformative era in cancer immunotherapy, driven by deep insights into cancer biology, immune escape mechanisms, and breakthroughs in treatments, including cancer vaccines. This evolution has been enriched by the development of antibody-inducing vaccines and the proliferation of licensed monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. The cumulative experience in therapeutic cancer vaccines and fundamental advancements in cancer immunobiology have laid a roadmap for future vaccine development, yet challenges persist. One such challenge is the identification of robust antigens and vaccine vectors that can trigger widespread T cell responses, requiring a detailed understanding of host\u2212 tumor interactions and tumor immune escape mechanisms. Customizing vaccine designs for optimal antigen presentation by expert APCs and locating combination partners using complementary mechanisms of action further add complexity to the task. The discovery of distinct tumor genes or protein products responsible for malignant transformation will open new vistas for targeted vaccination therapy. The integration of PROTACs, molecules that promote targeted protein degradation, offers a promising frontier in the battle against cancer. These chimeric molecules could be tailored to address specific cancer mutations, enhance the overall effectiveness of vaccines, and offer a new layer of precision in immunotherapies. Collaboration with vaccine strategies will potentially lead to innovative therapeutics that can selectively modulate or eliminate undesired proteins within cancer cells. The future of anticancer vaccines seems promising, yet laden with intricate scientific endeavors. \"Immune signatures\" will need to be refined to identify patients most likely to respond favorably to vaccination therapy. Further enhancement of clinical outcomes might be derived from intelligent combinations of vaccine strategies with additional drugs or interventions that synergistically elevate antitumor immunity. The rise of modern technologies such as molecular sequencing, artificial intelligence, and cellular engineering further emboldens the prospects of faster, cheaper, and more effective cancer vaccines. The landscape of cancer vaccine development is at an exciting yet demanding juncture. The relentless pursuit of understanding, innovation, and collaboration across the disciplines of immunology, oncology, genomics, and pharmaceuticals is vital. It will help to not only overcome current challenges but also enable the creation of more targeted and effective therapies, including the utilization of PROTACs. \n\nCAR-T cell therapy or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy is a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment.",

Pandhare, Swastika Maitra, Fayez M. Saleh, R. Saleem, Hamdan S Al-malky, V. Kumarasamy, Vetriselvan Subramaniyan, Mohamed M. Abdel-Daim, D. E. Uti\n## Abstract\nIn the realm of cancer immunotherapy, a profound evolution has ushered in sophisticated strategies that encompass both traditional cancer vaccines and emerging viral vaccines. This comprehensive Review offers an in-depth exploration of the methodologies, clinical applications, success stories, and future prospects of these approaches. Traditional cancer vaccines have undergone significant advancements utilizing diverse modalities such as proteins, peptides, and dendritic cells. More recent innovations have focused on the physiological mechanisms enabling the human body to recognize and combat precancerous and malignant cells, introducing specific markers like peptide-based anticancer vaccines targeting tumor-associated antigens. Moreover, cancer viral vaccines, leveraging engineered viruses to stimulate immune responses against specific antigens, exhibit substantial promise in inducing robust and enduring immunity. Integration with complementary therapeutic methods, including monoclonal antibodies, adjuvants, and radiation therapy, has not only improved survival rates but also deepened our understanding of viral virulence. Recent strides in vaccine design, encompassing oncolytic viruses, virus-like particles, and viral vectors, mark the frontier of innovation. While these advances hold immense potential, critical challenges must be addressed, such as strategies for immune evasion, potential off-target effects, and the optimization of viral genomes. In the landscape of immunotherapy, noteworthy innovations take the spotlight from the use of immunomodulatory agents for the enhancement of innate and adaptive immune collaboration. The emergence of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as precision tools for cancer therapy is particularly exciting. With a focus on various cancers, from melanoma to formidable solid tumors, this Review critically assesses types of cancer vaccines, mechanisms, barriers in vaccine therapy, vaccine efficacy, safety profiles, and immune-related adverse events, providing a nuanced perspective on the underlying mechanisms involving cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. The Review also underscores the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies such as clinical studies, molecular sequencing, and artificial intelligence in advancing the field of cancer vaccines. These tools not only expedite progress but also emphasize the multidimensional and rapidly evolving nature of this research, affirming its profound significance in the broader context of cancer therapy.\n## \u25a0 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTIVES\nThe past decade has marked a transformative era in cancer immunotherapy, driven by deep insights into cancer biology, immune escape mechanisms, and breakthroughs in treatments, including cancer vaccines. This evolution has been enriched by the development of antibody-inducing vaccines and the proliferation of licensed monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. The cumulative experience in therapeutic cancer vaccines and fundamental advancements in cancer immunobiology have laid a roadmap for future vaccine development, yet challenges persist. One such challenge is the identification of robust antigens and vaccine vectors that can trigger widespread T cell responses, requiring a detailed understanding of host\u2212 tumor interactions and tumor immune escape mechanisms. Customizing vaccine designs for optimal antigen presentation by expert APCs and locating combination partners using complementary mechanisms of action further add complexity to the task. The discovery of distinct tumor genes or protein products responsible for malignant transformation will open new vistas for targeted vaccination therapy. The integration of PROTACs, molecules that promote targeted protein degradation, offers a promising frontier in the battle against cancer. These chimeric molecules could be tailored to address specific cancer mutations, enhance the overall effectiveness of vaccines, and offer a new layer of precision in immunotherapies. Collaboration with vaccine strategies will potentially lead to innovative therapeutics that can selectively modulate or eliminate undesired proteins within cancer cells. The future of anticancer vaccines seems promising, yet laden with intricate scientific endeavors. \"Immune signatures\" will need to be refined to identify patients most likely to respond favorably to vaccination therapy. Further enhancement of clinical outcomes might be derived from intelligent combinations of vaccine strategies with additional drugs or interventions that synergistically elevate antitumor immunity. The rise of modern technologies such as molecular sequencing, artificial intelligence, and cellular engineering further emboldens the prospects of faster, cheaper, and more effective cancer vaccines. The landscape of cancer vaccine development is at an exciting yet demanding juncture. The relentless pursuit of understanding, innovation, and collaboration across the disciplines of immunology, oncology, genomics, and pharmaceuticals is vital. It will help to not only overcome current challenges but also enable the creation of more targeted and effective therapies, including the utilization of PROTACs. \n\nCAR-T cell therapy or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy is a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment.",

As such, recombinant technology can serve as a gateway for the development of safe and effective vaccines that can be delivered effectively with an appropriate adjuvant. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the role of recombinant vaccine technology, new adjuvants and the challenge of vaccine delivery. Related peer-reviewed journal article searches were conducted using a subscribed database at the Universiti Putra Malaysia library, involving areas of Health Sciences and Medicine via Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. New generation vaccines include highly purified synthetic or recombinant antigens that stimulate effective cell-mediated immune and mucosal immunity. In order to enhance their efficacy, a number of adjuvants are used. Efforts have also been made to explore the usage of non-invasive routes of administration, devices and equipment for optimized antigen and immune-potentiator delivery of the immune system. Recombinant vaccine technology is rapid, compared to the traditional method of vaccine development and does not require the handling of live viruses. It is, therefore, a promising technology for developing a future vaccine to curb emerging and re-emerging viral infections that may be life-threatening or teratogenic.",

            "text": ";Van Regenmortel, 2016). These pitfalls underscore the importance of acquiring new structural and functional insights into humoral immune responses against pathogens. Furthermore, incorporation of multiple structural techniques especially nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is favorable to study the structure and molecular dynamics of antigen-antibody complexes (Moraes et al., 2016). As structural vaccinology is still developing, its application is primarily limited to the design of recombinant protein vaccine, peptide vaccine, and VLPs. These vaccine platforms are associated with low immunogenicity. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate structural vaccinology with other complementary key technologies. For instance, DS-Cav1 protein vaccine could be integrated with the single-round replication recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector to potentially enhance its immunogenicity if required (Johnson et al., 2013). Lastly, a structural vaccinology approach should be extended to improve T-cell responses and not just focus on the B-cell responses to produce better viral vaccines in the future.",

            "text": "Despite the highly promising results described above for antibody induction by poxviral vectors recombinant for viral surface proteins, not all antigens have fared as well in the poxviral delivery system. The traditional approach utilized for the induction of hightitre antibody responses by subunit vaccines has been recombinant protein-in-adjuvant formulations. These technologies have performed robustly for a wide range of candidate antigens, although they rely heavily on heterologous expression systems for protein antigen production, as well as access to a suitable adjuvant. For many difficult pathogens however, such as malaria parasites, heterologous production of antigens in traditional expression systems such as Escherichia coli has proved extremely challenging [59]. \n\nSimilarly, access to proprietary adjuvants that are both potent and demonstrate acceptable reactogenicity profiles in humans has been equally problematic for many diseases of poverty [60]. The prospects of antibody induction using vectored vaccine technologies is therefore appealing given their aforementioned advantages, coupled with their known capabilities for induction of strong cellular immunity, unlike protein-based vaccines. Indeed, it is increasingly anticipated that induction of strong cellular immunity in conjunction with antibodies may be essential to protect against some of the most challenging viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens for which vaccines do not currently exist. \n\nThe development of viral vectored vaccines capable of inducing antibodies has been widely studied in the field of blood-stage malaria. The asexual blood-stage of the malaria parasite life-cycle sees exponential growth of parasite numbers within the host and is responsible for the associated morbidity and mortality [61]. Most vaccine developers have aimed to induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection of new host red blood cells by the invasive merozoite form of the parasite [62]. \n\nEarly studies using a leading candidate blood-stage malaria antigen, the 42 kDa C-terminus of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1 42 ), showed little to no detectable antibody induction following immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant MVA or FP9 vectors.",

            "text": "Alternative delivery technologies which co-opt aspects traditionally associated with immunization, such as viral vectored gene therapy, have shown some promise in delivering anti-influenza antibodies in mice, 11,12 but permanence concerns and pre-existing antivector serology may limit utility of repeatedly using these viral vectors in humans. \n\nA distinct approach to antibody immune therapy which would allow for simplicity of production and lower costs, with high stability and ease of deliverability could be advantageous. In this regard, the technology of DNA-encoded protein antigen delivery has specific advantages as demonstrated by recent successes in the DNA vaccine field: plasmid DNA is well-tolerated and nonintegrating, it does not require cold-chain distribution, it can be delivered repeatedly, and it is relatively inexpensive to produce. 13 owever, to date, the ability to produce substantial levels of protein expression systemically from in vivo delivery of plasmid DNA has not been considered feasible. \n\nIn this study, we describe construction, development, and in vivo delivery of DNA plasmids encoding optimized influenzaspecific broadly neutralizing antibodies, FluA and FluB, that target diverse influenza A and influenza B viruses, respectively. Delivery of FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb results in robust in vivo expression of functional antibodies which protect mice against lethal challenge. We show for the first time that FluA and FluB DMAbs are functionally equivalent to their corresponding protein monoclonal antibodies purified from in vitro cell production. These DMAb impart simultaneous prophylactic cross-protection against diverse strains of influenza A and influenza B virus when given in combination. Furthermore, FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb afford immediate protection without inhibiting host antiviral immunity. The DMAb anti-influenza technology provides a unique alternative strategy to seasonal vaccination, bioprocessed recombinant protein monoclonal antibodies or gene therapy approaches for universal prevention of severe influenza infection. This approach has important implications for protection against and treatment of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Conventional vaccines are developed by the attenuation or inactivation of pathogens. The antigenic part in the pathogens is responsible for inducing host immune response against pathogens and developing sufficient immunity against the pathogenic antigen is the superior goal for vaccine development. The success of vaccines primarily depends on the ability of antigens producing antibodymediated immunity whereas, managing cell-mediated immunity is important against intracellular organisms [1]. The choice of antigens is determined by their immunological efficacy and safety with or without the use of adjuvants [2]. Whereas the vaccine antigen intricacy may vary based on the state like the whole pathogen either inactivated, attenuated and split/subunit. Due to safety reasons, vaccines based on whole pathogens are being replaced by subunit and recombinant antigens and in this context, protein antigens and their epitopes are produced by the recombinant DNA technologies which make use of DNA sequence coding for the antigenic protein of the pathogen [3]. In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates [4]. In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen [5,6]. Undoubtedly, investigation of the effect of dose of antigens on murine models before vaccine development is an important goal. Immunization protocols in mice models will integrate the biological complexities of the immune system and gives a maximum prediction of the efficacy as well as adverse effects [7]. In the present study, we have explored three recombinant antigens (HBsAg, JEV and DENV) for dose optimization required for screening the novel vaccine adjuvants or delivery systems.",

We also described some of the current technologies being applied to vaccine development for pathogens that have resisted more traditional/conservative vaccine approaches. For each of the emerging technologies, we gave examples of how these technologies were being utilized for vaccine development, in animal studies and in some cases, clinical testing in humans. There are many technologies and approaches not described in this review; i.e., deceptive imprinting, immune refocusing, RNA, nanotechnologies, among others. \n\nMany challenges to vaccine development exist. The type of immune response elicited by a vaccine (i.e., humoral vs. cellular responses), the strength (i.e., does it protect against any level of infection, reduce severe infection) and longevity of (i.e., single immunization or are boosters necessary) that response could significantly impede vaccine development. Vaccine development can be further hindered by how the immune response is generated (i.e., protein, epitope, antibody) and delivered (i.e., viral vectors, adjuvants, formulated). Once a vaccine is developed through study in animal models, there can be challenges with scale up for mass production (i.e., use in human trials), dosing, route of administration (i.e., intramuscular, intranasal, oral) and effectively protecting diverse target populations (i.e., infants, immunocompromised individuals, elderly). Each of these facets introduces additional elements that need to be studied, understood and addressed when developing a vaccine. \n\nCurrent technologies are primarily focused on improving the quality of the immune response via rational design of the antigen through stabilizing complex structure(s) and identifying neutralizing epitopes. High levels of variability in antigenic proteins can pose a unique barrier to vaccine development-how to target a protein or epitope subject to selective pressures? Often the most abundant antibodies in seropositive sera are not the most potent or effective at neutralizing infection, as is the case with CMV, where the majority of antibodies target gB but the most potent are directed towards the gH/gL/UL128-131 complex.",

            "text": "The past decade has marked a transformative era in cancer immunotherapy, driven by deep insights into cancer biology, immune escape mechanisms, and breakthroughs in treatments, including cancer vaccines. This evolution has been enriched by the development of antibody-inducing vaccines and the proliferation of licensed monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. The cumulative experience in therapeutic cancer vaccines and fundamental advancements in cancer immunobiology have laid a roadmap for future vaccine development, yet challenges persist. One such challenge is the identification of robust antigens and vaccine vectors that can trigger widespread T cell responses, requiring a detailed understanding of host\u2212 tumor interactions and tumor immune escape mechanisms. Customizing vaccine designs for optimal antigen presentation by expert APCs and locating combination partners using complementary mechanisms of action further add complexity to the task. The discovery of distinct tumor genes or protein products responsible for malignant transformation will open new vistas for targeted vaccination therapy. The integration of PROTACs, molecules that promote targeted protein degradation, offers a promising frontier in the battle against cancer. These chimeric molecules could be tailored to address specific cancer mutations, enhance the overall effectiveness of vaccines, and offer a new layer of precision in immunotherapies. Collaboration with vaccine strategies will potentially lead to innovative therapeutics that can selectively modulate or eliminate undesired proteins within cancer cells. The future of anticancer vaccines seems promising, yet laden with intricate scientific endeavors. \"Immune signatures\" will need to be refined to identify patients most likely to respond favorably to vaccination therapy. Further enhancement of clinical outcomes might be derived from intelligent combinations of vaccine strategies with additional drugs or interventions that synergistically elevate antitumor immunity. The rise of modern technologies such as molecular sequencing, artificial intelligence, and cellular engineering further emboldens the prospects of faster, cheaper, and more effective cancer vaccines. The landscape of cancer vaccine development is at an exciting yet demanding juncture. The relentless pursuit of understanding, innovation, and collaboration across the disciplines of immunology, oncology, genomics, and pharmaceuticals is vital. It will help to not only overcome current challenges but also enable the creation of more targeted and effective therapies, including the utilization of PROTACs. \n\nCAR-T cell therapy or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy is a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment.",

            "text": "One hundred years after the \"magic bullet\" proposal by Paul Ehrlich and decades after the establishment of hybridoma technology for producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by Ko \u00a8hler (1) and others (2,3), antibodies have finally become very attractive therapeutic modalities. The high potency of antibodies and the ability to generate a seemingly unlimited diversity of specificities have led to antibody-based therapies that target many different illnesses and diseases (4 -6). The majority of therapeutic antibodies currently available on the market are of mouse origin. Despite the proven success of animal immunizations for over 3 decades, the generation of mAbs for therapeutic purposes is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires months of work from the initial immunization to the identification of specific hybridoma antibodies. Although other approaches, such as phage display (7) and human memory B-cell immortalization and cloning (8), have been developed for the derivation of fully human mAbs that do not require animal immunization, these methods have shown limited success due to the challenges associated with antibodies of non-immune origins (9). To date, the production of mAbs from immunized rodents remains the most highly used platform for generating high quality therapeutic biologics, because of the natural in vivo recombination and affinity maturation of antibodies that occur during the humoral immune response in immunized animals (10 -12). \n\nGenerating an effective immune response is not only fundamental for therapeutic antibody discovery, but is also crucial for vaccine development in combating infectious disease. Both begin with the host immune response elicited against the foreign antigen/vaccine after immunization. While animal immunization for therapeutic antibody generation requires a mechanism-driven strategy for obtaining antibodies that can demonstrate the therapeutic mode of action prior to hybridoma fusion and/or B-cell recovery efforts, vaccine development emphasizes the stimulation of protective immune responses by the host's immune system that are of sufficient strength and quality to sustain efficient and long term protection (13,14). The development of an optimal immune response to meet either goal is challenging due to the sophisticated mechanisms that control immune responses (15).",

            "text": "The traditional approach to antibody induction by vaccination has been the delivery of recombinant protein, or particle-in-adjuvant formulations. An alternative strategy, developed over the last decade, has seen the use of recombinant viral vectored vaccines to deliver protein antigens of interest, whereby the design and administration of these vectors has been optimized to induce antibodies in conjunction with the T cell responses for which they were historically favored (32,33). Such a strategy is particularly attractive when the antigen of interest is refractory to production in recombinant form using heterologous expression platforms. Indeed, the RH5_FL protein proved particularly difficult to express for many years, with the first highly promising vaccine data generated by use of the viral vector platform (12). In the case of this approach, a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (of human or simian serotype) is used to prime the immune response, followed by a booster vaccination (typically 8 weeks later) with an attenuated poxvirus recombinant for the same antigen (33). This heterologous prime-boost approach has shown antibody induction against difficult-to-express malaria antigens in numerous animal models, including nonhuman primates (32,34,35). These vectors, delivering antigens from P. falciparum, have now been shown to be safe and immunogenic for T cell and antibodies in healthy European and American adult volunteers (36)(37)(38)(39)(40), as well as African adults, children, and infants (41,42). More recently, similar adenovirus-poxvirus vectored vaccine technologies have been used to immunize humans against numerous other pathogens including P. vivax malaria (43), Ebola virus (44), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (45), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (46) and HIV-1 (47).",

Five time points were investigated: Days 1, 42, 63, 98, and 140 (Figure 4). Both antigens, DBD-Ag85a and DBD-ESAT6-CFP10, stimulated the production of specific IgG antibodies in all groups, with an increase in antibody titer by Day 42 with an additional increase after the second vaccination with GamTBvac compared to the baseline titers. A dose-dependent effect was observed: in Group 3, an increase in the titer of IgG antibodies to DBD-Ag85a was significantly reduced comparing to the other two groups. \n\nThe contribution of individual antigens included into the candidate vaccine to the formation of IgG profiles was lower in general than that of fused molecules, and distributed as follows: CFP10, Ag85A, and DBD stimulated IgG production at Day 98 postvaccination, and later in Groups 4 and 5, while a significant reaction toward the ESAT6 antigen was only observed in Group 5 at Day 63 (p = 0.0401). In Group 3 (low vaccine dose), no significant increase in IgG titers was detected. \n\nOur results propose that a second vaccination was essential for the formation of stable humoral immune response to GamTBvac antigens. After reimmunization at Day 67, IgG titers to both fusion antigens were maintained until the end observation at Day 140, which indicated the formation of stable memory that provided a humoral response to vaccine antigens. A comparison of antigen-specific IgG response between the groups showed higher antibody titers for the half and standard doses compared to the low dose. Differences between the half and standard doses were not significant.",

The system described here provides a direct correlate to quantitate recombinant proteins produced in various matrices, including clinical samples, without the need for antigen-specific reagents. For development of recombinant vaccines, this system may provide a mechanism to monitor recombinant antigen production in vivo following vaccination, determine vaccine vector expression kinetics, optimize delivery methods, and correlate the amount of recombinant antigen produced with host immune response, and protection from infection. Lastly, this reporter system may be widely applicable to monitor transgene expression for a variety of biomedical purposes including gene therapy, drug screening, vaccine production, and bio-manufacturing.",

            "text": "Serum taken from human volunteers vaccinated with a new acellular plague vaccine (containing recombinant proteins rF1 and rV) was assessed for protective efficacy by passive transfer into mice. Mice were subsequently exposed to a lethal aerosol of plague and the delay in mean time-to-death measured. This process was shown to be reproducible and these data indicated that Hsd:NIHS mice may be a better model than BALB/c mice for passive transfer studies with human serum. \n\nThe last two papers in this special issue describe research on a generic DNA vaccination approach and a potential immunotherapy treatment for Ebola. S. Qiu and colleagues constructed DNA and recombinant Tiantan vaccinia (rTTV) vaccines encoding OVA-CTB fusion protein. They concluded that, following studies in mice, using an intranasal DNA prime and intramuscular recombinant-vaccinia boost, that fusion-expressed CTB could serve as a potent adjuvant to enhance both systemic and mucosal T-cell responses. S. Dowall et al. describe early studies using in vitro models to investigate potential targets for immunomodulatory therapy during infection with the highly infectious Ebola virus. They showed binding of the phosphatidylserine-targeting antibody (bavituximab), which has already progressed through clinical trials (phases I-III) for treatment of tumours, to the surface of host cells infected with Ebola and also to purified Ebola virions. Assessing immune therapies for other indications has the potential to allow repurposing of products for treatment of biodefence agents, potentially saving significantly on research and development time and costs. \n\nIn conclusion, this special issue has surveyed a diverse range of approaches to the development of biodefence vaccines and therapies and has explored the likely impact and application to the field of exciting new technological developments.",

            "text": "Vaccine development began in the 18th century with the use of whole microorganisms to generate protective immune responses in humans. However, live attenuated and inactivated whole viral and bacterial vaccines still belong to some of the most successful human vaccines in use today, e.g. oral polio, measles (standalone and in measles/mumps/rubella combination), influenza, typhoid, cholera, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, although there have been recurring problems associated with product contamination, genetic instability, and residual virulence. Although some early vaccines were based upon protein subunits or toxins that could be extracted from bacterial cells (e.g. diphtheria, tetanus, flu, anthrax, and rabies), it was the emergence of the tools of molecular biology that signaled a new era in vaccine development. The stimulation of protective antibody responses is still key to the success of almost all of the preventive vaccines in use today. Rather than using whole microorganisms as vaccines, identifying and producing individual molecular targets of protective antibodies, such as surface proteins or polysaccharide capsules, became an important focus of vaccine research. The challenging problem of identifying suitable surface antigens on bacterial pathogens, able to confer protection, has been approached more recently by applying large-scale genomic and proteomic technologies. Putative surface proteins on bacteria can be identified by bioinformatics, produced as recombinant proteins, and tested immunologically in a high-throughput fashion for their ability to elicit protective immune responses, an empirical approach that has been termed 'reverse vaccinology' [62][63][64][65]. The success of this approach in identifying protective antigens has now been demonstrated, even in some cases where conventional approaches to vaccine development had failed [66-68]. However, the use of recombinant proteins as vaccines continues to rely on the co-administration of suitable adjuvants to provide a sufficient boost to the immune system, and this remains problematic because of adjuvant toxicity [69]. \n\nOver the past few years, advances in structural biology have led to a dramatic increase in structural knowledge about how antibodies recognize vaccine antigens.",

Strategies to overcome these challenges, such as the use of antigens that have the ability to induce immunity across different serotypes, are currently being employed [17,24,25,29,30]. Current investigations into broadly neutralizing antibodies have provided new focus on potential conserved epitopes. Yet, the induction of serotype cross-reactivity remains limited, and recombinant, epitope-focused approaches are not necessarily faster or more fruitful [29,30]. So far, there are only a handful of recombinant protein vaccine antigens, such as hepatitis B. There are 82 vaccine products licensed in the US. Of these, 35 are polyvalent (Fig 1B). The frequency and overall valency associated with vaccine development appear to be increasing. Collectively, the need for potent and broadly efficacious vaccine preparations highlights the importance of this yeoman's work in vaccine development.",

Thus, vaccine development has been required to move toward a new generation of vaccines that could provide better and more sustainable protective immune responses (2). \n\nInterest in the use of innovative antigens such as recombinant proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids has increased in the last few decades (3)(4)(5). In spite of the many advantages of these new vaccine prototypes, including an enhanced immunogenicity/ risk ratio profile and easier manufacture, the development of improved adjuvants that may enhance the potency of these vaccines has become essential. Several inmunostimulant molecules (i.e., cytokines, toll-like receptor ligands, toxins, or saponins) and antigen delivery systems (i.e., virosomes, emulsions, or nanoparticles) are among the potential adjuvants studied in this scope. In particular, the use of nanosystems has attracted significant attention, especially for vaccines requiring an improvement in cell-mediated immune responses (6). \n\nPolymer-and lipid-based nanoparticles have been the most widely explored nanosystems in vaccination. It has already been reported that nanostructures are able to enhance both B and T cell responses due to their similarity with viruses in terms of size and surface properties (7). In addition, due to their prolonged presentation to the immune system, these nanostructures can induce long-lasting immune responses, thereby offering the possibility of decreasing the number of doses required to achieve protective antibody levels. Moreover, nanoparticle formulations have shown the ability to avoid overactivation of the immune response and, simultaneously, to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (8). \n\nOur group has developed a number of antigen delivery technologies and validated them using rHBsAg as a model antigen. Namely, we have produced various chitosan-based nanocarriers, including chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles (9), CS nanoparticles (10), and CS nanocapsules (NCs) (11).",

            "text": "Major efforts to improve the approaches for vaccine development are underway. As can be seen from Figure 1, the development of synthetic influenza vaccines is the third platform for influenza vaccine production. Several novel technologies that may improve the production process have been described recently. These technologies could make possible the development of eliciting long-lasting and broadly cross-reactive universal influenza vaccines (UIVs) without the need for eggs [11].\n\nWith the development of plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques [12], it is now possible to engineer recombinant influenza viruses entirely from full-length complementary DNA copies of the viral genome by the transfection of vaccine-approved susceptible cells. The gene synthesis technique combined with reverse genetics approaches allows the generation of IIV and LAIV 6:2 vaccine candidates within short time frames.\n\nRecombinant HA-based protein technology may help to solve many problems associated with the use of chicken embryos, such as the low affinity of current H3N2 viruses to eggs, and the necessity of speeding up the vaccine development process. However, the low immunogenicity of recombinant HA-based subunit vaccines necessitates repeated vaccination and the use of adjuvants.\n\nAn ideal true UIV can induce a cross-protective, broadly neutralizing immune response against conserved viral antigens; offer a combination of protection from antigenic drift/shift; and confer lifelong immunity. It is effective against all influenza A and B virus subtypes/lineages regardless of any mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA). To design this type of vaccine, the highly conserved epitopes present in HA, NA, or M2 and internal proteins should be targeted to induce cross-protective antibodies and T-cells. The development of a UIV can be significantly facilitated by newly developed platform technologies such as multi-epitopes, virus-like particles (VLP), and DNA-and mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nOver 20 different approaches are described as strategies for the development of UIVs, such as HA-targeting vaccines (chimeric, mosaic, and headless HAs, and mosaic nanoparticles), M2-targeting vaccines, internal protein-targeting vaccines, and NA-targeting vaccines. These approaches include recombinant, protein-",

            "text": "Recombinant antibodies (rAbs) are defined in this review as antibodies which were selected or engineered, and expressed, utilizing DNA-based molecular biology techniques. Regarding the particular case of BWs, the risk of antibiotic resistance is acute because bacteria voluntarily disseminated could first be selected or engineered, for antimicrobial resistance. The development of antibodies may be a reasonable response to this risk; existing therapeutics, when they are effective, often act by other mechanisms and may act synergistically with antibodies. Antibodies may also be utilized for prophylaxis despite their relatively short half-life (~three weeks for human antibodies), which can be increased using numerous methods. 13 In effect, antibodies bring immediate protection that could be focused on personnel at risk of being exposed to BWs. The focused protection afforded by antibodies is advantageous compared with the protection elicited by vaccines, as vaccines must elicit an immune response to be effective and maintenance of this response may require booster injections. Further, rAbs may be administered in quantities that exceed that elicited by vaccines, and thus provide a higher level of protection, which is useful because BW exposure could involve elevated levels compared with natural exposure. In the particular case of botulinum neurotoxins, which are potential BWs, vaccination could be ethically disputable. RAb production is costly, but the number of doses needed is likely to be limited compared with the supply requirements for naturally encountered infectious diseases. This high production cost can be counterbalanced attacks, this rate was reported at 45% with treatment, 17 due to a limited therapeutic window. B. anthracis produces several virulence factors that contribute to pathogenesis, in particular the lethal toxin (LT), which is composed of protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF), the edema toxin (ET) composed of PA and edema factor (EF), and poly-\u03b3-d-glutamic acid (\u03b3DPGA) capsule. 18 The scientific consensus 19,20 on the animal models for anthrax vaccines and therapeutics recommends rabbits and nonhuman primates (NHPs). The estimated lethal dose by an aerosol varies; however, the survival threshold in rabbits and NHPs is less than 10,000 spores. 21",

Although these technologies have yet to be applied to large-scale clinical vaccine trials, the large numbers of subjects in such trials and the importance of genetic factors in determining immune responses make this subject a logical focus of investigation. The judicious use of genotyping in human trials is likely to allow the identification of genes that determine responsiveness in human populations. Such information could be used to further optimize vaccines and to test and predict their efficacy in specific human populations.\n\nFinally, although the field of vaccination has historically focused on the prevention of infectious diseases, this technology provides a broader base for immune modulation of pathologic responses underlying other conditions. Recent studies have explored the possibility of using vaccination or immune intervention for the treatment of neurologic diseases, specifically Alzheimer disease, based on the ability of antibodies to reduce the formation of neurologic lesions in a mouse model of the disease 66 . A vaccine approach has also been developed for the prevention of atherosclerosis through the generation of antibodies to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) 67,68 . CETP inhibition might increase the ratio of high-to low-density lipoproteins; this more favorable lipid profile is found in individuals with specific inherited mutations of CETP associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Specific vaccine strategies have also been applied to a variety of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Finally, as noted above, the field of cancer immunotherapy has shown increasing promise as tumor antigens have been better defined, and the mechanisms that prevent immune responses to malignancies better understood. Better understanding of the basic molecular lesions and the delivery technology, as well as a more systematic assessment of human immune responses to tumor antigens will likely yield continued improvements in the success of these approaches.\n\nOver the last several years, advances in gene-based delivery technology arising from the field of gene therapy have helped revitalize the field of vaccine development 69 . There have been advances in the understanding of a number of viruses, and the methodology for making recombinant gene products, both of protein-and gene-based vaccines, has diversified and improved.

            "text": "Individual antigenic epitope mapping of native proteins provides useful information that can assist in the design of peptide-based diagnostic tests and peptide libraries for monitoring specific cellular immunity in patients (19)(20)(21). We have attempted to construct a peptide-specific monoclonal antibody library against LT-A by epitope mapping utilizing synthetic peptides for the production of an ETEC vaccine. \n\nThe currently available ETEC vaccine is a recombinant vaccine that combines four recombinant E. coli strains that overproduce adhesins CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6 with a recombinant protein, LCTBA (CTB/LTB hybrid B subunit protein), which is a hybrid B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin and cholera toxin (22). This recombinant vaccine seemed to be safe and well tolerated in children aged 6-59 months when administered orally, as evidenced by the absence of treatment-related serious adverse events (23). The basis for this approach was that a higher immunogenic response may arise from the binding of a weak immunogen to the carrier molecule. Recombinant molecules can also be used in this process. Moreover, recombinant technology offers a rapid and cost-effective method for the creation of toxoids compared with coupling processes. \n\nThe main goal of the current research effort focusing on the development of an ETEC vaccine was to induce immune responses against colonization factors (CFs) and one or both ETEC toxins, which contribute to protective immunity (24,25). In addition, several of the existing candidate CF/CS antigens may cross-react with antibodies, potentially expanding coverage (26,27). CF/coli surface (CF/CS) antigens vary considerably; thus, vaccines must express epidemiologically frequent CF/CS antigens and toxin components. A vaccine produced using four-to-five such components would protect against 70%-80% of the most prevalent strains linked to illness. \n\nWhile cross-reactivity has been exploited to develop a recombinant vaccine for LT-A, the design of peptides for an ETEC vaccine has not been reported, and the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies in preventing enteric infections is still unclear.",

The selected recombinant inoviruses that carry mimotopes can then be isolated in order to determine the DNA and amino acid sequence of the displayed oligopeptides. DNA sequencing of such inserts as well as structure prediction analysis can potentially identify the previously unknown target of an antibody. Besides antibody characterization, inoculation of recombinant inoviruses isolated through this approach can potentially be used as vaccine carriers. For example, if a neutralizing antibody against a pathogen is used to screen an RPL, the selected peptides (fused to inoviruses) would mimic the original antibody epitope. Vaccination of animals with these inoviruses could ultimately induce the production of similar antibodies by the vaccinated individual, offering protection from infection against the pathogen. Inovirus display technology has been successfully applied in the development of vaccines against various pathogens (Tables 1 and 2). The potential for inovirus display technology to facilitate the mapping of antibody epitopes is of great importance, especially in the case of HIV-1. Epitopes of broadly neutralizing monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibodies could be rare, vulnerable spots on the surface of a frequently mutating virus such as HIV-1 and therefore, their identification and further study could lead to new drug therapies or vaccine targets. This review focuses particularly on the applications of inovirus display technology that utilizes capsid proteins gp3 and gp8, as those have been used in vaccine development.",

            "text": "The development of the genetic engineering technologies and immunological proteomics analysis triggered the increasing emergence of the recombinant protein-based vaccines (rPBVs). Therefore, recombinant PBVs are one of the most promising and powerful technologies for vaccine design and artificially inducing immunity [87]. In addition, these vaccines with their relatively cheap production protocols and most importantly, logistical advantages including stability at a wide range of temperatures, could also ensure vaccines access in developing countries. \n\nRecombinant antigens may deliver effective protection comparable to native antigens, and some have been successfully developed into vaccines against metazoan parasites. Although concerning a different phylum, the recombinant Gavac \u00ae (Heber Biotec S.A., Cuba) anti-tick vaccine represents a suitable example. It was developed in the 1990s to control Boophilus microplus in cattle and it consists of the recombinant Bm86 protein (hidden antigen) expressed in E. coli [88]. In addition to ticks, recombinant antigens can also be used to control parasitic nematodes. Due to the complex developmental cycle of parasitic nematodes, to date only a prototype recombinant cocktail vaccine against Teladorsagia circumcincta has shown promising results in animal trials. The vaccine contains eight antigens recombinantly expressed either in E. coli or in Pichia pastoris [89,90]. \n\nRegarding H. contortus, a number of trials using different recombinant antigens have been reported (Table 1); H11, H-gal-GP, some ES antigens, and the somatic antigens are considered as promising candidates [64,67,91]. Among the trials, somatic antigen Hc23 and ES products ES15/ES24, expressed in E. coli and refolded, could significantly reduce the worm burden (70%) in lambs, which is very encouraging, despite the fact that the efficacies are still lower than the aforementioned native hidden antigen H11 [60,61].",

Such antibodies would circumvent potential reactogenicity of antibodies made in other species.

            "text": "Modern biotechnology provides a huge potential for human health improvement by the development of new therapies and vaccines against infectious diseases. In the best cases, vaccines can provide great economic value with cost-benefit ratios of 1:10 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998). However, the development and implementation of new vaccines often encounter substantial cost and logistical barriers that are difficult to overcome in many countries that are economically depressed. The use of transgenic plantderived recombinant proteins is a promising strategy that combines the innovations in medical science and plant biology to create affordable vaccines. The potential benefits are low cost, heat stability, oral administration, and convenience of production in developing countries. A growing number of laboratories are investing in plant-derived protein pharmaceuticals, expanding on the seminal works that first proposed this idea (Curtis and Cardineau, 1990;Mason et al., 1992). The subject of plant-derived vaccines has been reviewed several times in recent years (Koprowski and Yusibov, 2001;Mason et al., 2002), and a nearly comprehensive list of vaccine antigens produced in plants has been provided (Daniell et al., 2001). While much research is yet needed to optimize plant production of vaccines and to validate them in largescale clinical trials, the results to date show a very promising technology that is on the brink of commercial development. Ingestion of transgenic plants expressing vaccine antigens can, via the gut lymphoid system, result in specific mucosal secretory IgA (S-IgA) and serum IgG antibody responses. Although protective efficacy of a plant-derived vaccine has yet to be determined in humans, some challenge studies in animals have shown promising results and are discussed later in the text. The previous chapter in this series (Palmer et al., 1999) described plant expression systems and their use in vaccine studies in some detail. In this chapter, we examine the advances in the field of transgenic plant-derived mucosal vaccines, focusing on the results of human clinical trials and on orally delivered animal vaccines. Another chapter in this volume (Lomonossoff, G.P.; see Chapter 59) describes work involving plant viruses to produce vaccines.",

In spite of successful interventions and treatment protocols, an HIV vaccine would be the ultimate prevention and control strategy. Ever since identification of HIV/AIDS, there have been meticulous efforts for vaccine development. The specific aim of this paper is to review recent vaccine efficacy trials and associated advancements and discuss the current challenges and future directions. Recombinant DNA technologies greatly facilitated development of many viral products which were later incorporated into vectors for effective vaccines. Over the years, a number of scientific approaches have gained popularity and include the induction of neutralizing antibodies in late 1980s, induction of CD8 T cell in early 1990s, and combination approaches currently. Scientists have hypothesized that stimulation of right sequences of somatic hypermutations could induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of effective neutralization and viral elimination. Studies have shown that a number of host and viral factors affect these processes. Similarly, eliciting specific CD8 T cells immune responses through DNA vaccines hold future promises. In summary, future studies should focus on the continuous fight between host immune responses and ever-evasive viral factors for effective vaccines.",

            "text": "An alternative approach, developed in recent years, has used recombinant viral vectored vaccines to deliver proteins of interest with the key aim of inducing antibodies in conjunction with T cell responses. A strategy demonstrating the highest degree of success to date has utilized a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus to prime an immune response, followed by a booster vaccination (typically 8 weeks later) with an attenuated poxvirus recombinant for the same antigen (28). This approach has been shown to be reliably immunogenic for hightiter antibody induction against a variety of difficult-to-express malaria antigens in mice, rabbits, and non-human primates (NHP) (29)(30)(31)(32). It has also been shown to be safe and immunogenic for the delivery of the P. falciparum blood-stage antigens merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP1) and apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) in a series of Phase I/IIa clinical trials in healthy adult UK volunteers (33), and the same viral vectored vaccine technologies are currently entering Phase II/III clinical testing in West Africa for Ebola (34). \n\nAn extension of this approach has seen the development of \"mixed modality\" adenoviral prime -protein-in-adjuvant boost (AP) regimes, whereby the two leading subunit vaccine delivery platforms are combined, often leading to improved immune responses in mice in comparison to the use of either strategy alone (35, 36). In agreement with these murine data, NHP studies of similar regimes, for candidate malaria and HIV-1 vaccines, have also shown particular promise (30,37,38). Here, we generated both preclinical and clinically compatible adenoviral and poxviral vectored vaccine candidates expressing PvDBP_RII. We report on the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of these vaccines in mice or rabbits, either used alone in a viral vectored prime-boost regime or in AP regimes using a recombinant protein PvDBP_RII antigen administered in adjuvant.",

            "text": "Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the most potent enterotoxins involved in a large number of non-menstrual TSS cases as well as a major mediator of staphylococcal food poisoning (6,7). However, the major source of interest in SEB stems from the potential for this toxin to be used as an agent of biowarfare or bioterrorism. SEB (then code-named PG) was a major and strategic component of the United States offensive program before the ban on biological weapons in 1972 (8). SEB was especially attractive as a bioweapon because of the ease of production, the fact that much lower doses could be effective compared with chemical agents, and its profound potentiating effect as a component of dual agent bioweapons (10). There is currently renewed concern that this toxin can be used in bioterrorism activities. There is currently no therapeutic available for SEB, and a recombinant SEB vaccine (STEBVax) is in early clinical development.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin has been used in treatment of streptococcal TSS with limited success (11,12). However, there is no evidence that intravenous immunoglobulin can be effective against staphylococcal TSS in the clinic (12). Hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin could be produced upon donor stimulation with a recombinant attenuated SEB vaccine because this approach has been successful for several other infectious agents. However, this approach is complicated by the need for maintaining a donor cohort, the high dose needed for protection, manufacturing and safety issues, and cost. Monoclonal antibodies represent an attractive alternative to these traditional treatments because these agents can be produced on a large scale using a reproducible process. Recent advances in phage display technologies have led to generation of highly divergent synthetic antibody libraries that can be used for discovery of human antibodies without the need for lengthy hybridoma antibody production and subsequent humanization of mouse monoclonals (13,14). In the current study, we report the discovery and characterization of highly effective synthetic human antibody therapeutics for prophylactic and postexposure",

            "text": "Such abundant glycosylation is an advantage of the plant-based vaccine production system that cannot be achieved in bacterial expression systems [26][27][28]. \n\nWe evaluated the safety and protective efficacy of our recombinant vaccine against PEDV in newborn piglets. In immunized pregnant sows, we observed elicited antibody ELISA and viral neutralizing titers in the serum and high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the colostrum collected after farrowing. It is promising to see that the plant-derived S1 with Fc domain subunit vaccine provided effective lactogenic immunity, as demonstrated by the survival of neonatal piglets from immunized sows after challenge with virulent PEDV. This suggests that the vaccine is capable of inducing protective antibodies that were transferred to the piglets through colostrum and milk, providing them with the necessary immunity to survive the viral challenge. However, further studies are needed to fully assess the safety, efficacy, and long-term immunity conferred by this vaccine. In addition, histopathological examination at the experimental end point demonstrated that lesion scores of piglets from vaccinated sows were significantly lower than unvaccinated animals. Further, the duration of virus shedding into the feces was significantly shorter in the piglets of vaccinated sows. These results suggest that vaccination reduces clinical signs of disease in piglets, and may reduce the risk of transmission between groups by blocking viral shedding. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of our highly antigenic, recombinant vaccine composed of protein combined with a molecular adjuvant. In particular, veterinary vaccine manufacture may benefit from this technology due to less stringent GMP requirements and the associated costs of production, and the attractive possibility of vaccinating orally, particularly in the case of gastrointestinal pathogens [29]. Further studies are required with a larger number of pigs in the field, and to optimize immunization procedures. The recombinant S1 protein with Fc domain has potential for effectively preventing PEDV.",

            "text": "In the last decade, along with the continuing development of the disciplines of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics and the application of molecular biological approaches to elucidate the functions of single genes, advances have led to insights into the complexities and multifaceted nature of diseases such as cancer, immune and inflammatorybased diseases, metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, transplantation, and some poorly understood dermatologic toxicities [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Specific, targeted approaches now employed in many monoclonal antibody (mAb), fusion protein, and cytokine therapies have been enabled by advances in recombinant DNA technology, the preparation of human recombinant antibody libraries, today's sequencing methods, parallel proteome analyses employing techniques such as mass spectroscopy, and single B cell technologies [5][6][7]. The U.S. Food and Drug Authority (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development and its European equivalent have provided extra stimulus for the development of therapies for \"orphan diseases\", that is, diseases with less than 200,000 patients [8]. This stimulus has led to the introduction of effective approved mAb therapies for some diseases with low Figure 1. Evolution of the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies from murine to fully human proteins to avoid unwanted immunogenicity. The iterative process proceeded stepwise through chimeric constructs incorporating mouse immunoglobulin variable regions into constant regions of human immunoglobulins and via humanized antibodies by substituting mouse complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in place of human sequences.

            "text": "Recombinant antibody technology has undergone tremendous development in recent decades, so to prompt much progress in disease diagnosis and therapy. The use of display technologies allows in vitro selection from non-animal-derived recombinant (na\u00efve or synthetic) repertoires (libraries) of peptides and antibody fragments in different formats such as Fab fragments (Fabs), scFvs, and Nbs. Different platforms are available such as phage display, yeast display, ribosome display, bacterial display, mammalian cell surface display, mRNA display, and DNA display. All of them mimic what occurs in vivo during antibody generation by the immune system as they rely on (1) genotypic diversity, which can be obtained by immune stimulation of a competent organism or by cloning; (2) the link existing between the genotype and phenotype; (3) selective pressure for increasing antibody specificity; and (4) amplification of specific clones originated by selective pressure. The coding sequences of binders specific for a given antigen, identified by the display technology of choice, can be expressed in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems and tested both in vitro and in vivo for their ability to counteract the target antigen activity. \n\nThe possibility to engineer the originally identified antibody sequence represents an added value, since affinity, stability, and expression level can be improved while maintaining the desired antigen-binding properties. Furthermore, it is possible to modify the format so that the antibody could acquire new kinetic properties. Importantly, it is feasible to bypass the risk of immune reactions during clinical use by constructing antibodies from human scaffolds. \n\nA whole IgG molecule (150 kDa) comprises heavy (H) and light (L) chains each consisting of a variable (VH and VL) and a constant (CH and CL) region covalently linked to each other and to oligosaccharides necessary for antibody effector functions and for long serum half-life. The antigen-binding regions responsible for diversity among antibodies are the complementary determining regions (CDRs), three for each VH and VL.",

            "text": "In the search for innovative vaccine strategies, passive immunization has emerged as a promising yet underexplored approach. Instead of prompting the body to produce its own immune response, this strategy involves administering antibodies directly, thus offering immediate protection against infections, particularly in high-risk populations (Tharmalingam et al., 2022). These antibodies are often generated through recombinant approaches, allowing precise targeting of viral antigens. Platforms like CHO cells and plant expression systems are commonly used to produce these recombinant antibodies at a large scale (Pirkalkhoran et al., 2023). Alternatively, the hybridoma technique is also a common method for producing monoclonal antibodies. It involves fusing B lymphocytes from an immunized animal with myeloma cells, creating hybrid cells known as \"hybridomas.\" Once the desired antibody-secreting clones are identified, they are cultured to continuously proliferate, enabling large-scale production for clinical applications (Moraes et al., 2021). In spite of the potential of antibody-centered platforms for combating viral diseases, only a few studies have been conducted on the development of this type of immunotherapy against mpox. \n\nA vaccine type based on passive immunization was developed by Li M. et al. (2023). After identifying that the monoclonal antibodies 3A1, 2D1, and 9F8 bind to A29L, they proceeded to produce those antibodies through hybridoma technology. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the antibodies was evaluated by administering monoclonal antibodies to mice and challenging them with VACV TT and VACV WR strains. The challenge occurred either 1 day after prophylactic administration (before infection) or following therapeutic administration (after infection). Interestingly, 9F8 displayed the highest neutralization activity and demonstrated full protective activity, while 3A1 and 2D1 showed partial protection in some groups, indicating that the antibody 9F8 could be considered in forthcoming immunotherapeutic trials against MPXV. Zhao et al. (2024) investigated the use of monoclonal antibodies to target specific antigens of MPXV.",

            "text": "Increased understanding of the immune system and developments in recombinant DNA technology led to the emergence of innovative vaccine strategies and the notion that cancer vaccines could become a common treatment modality in the next decade. The recent licensure of DC-based vaccine Provenge \u00ae for the treatment of prostate cancer in humans along with the approval of Oncept\u2122 as therapy for oral melanoma in dogs lends support to the clinical promise of cancer vaccines (Aurisicchio and Ciliberto 2011). Ad-based cancer vaccines represent an important and rapidly developing branch of the cancer vaccinology field. Ad vectors emerged as promising gene therapy vectors and recombinant vaccine carriers owing to their well-characterized molecular genetics, high yield propagation capacity amenable to pharmaceutical scale production, and biological characteristics (Choi and Yun 2013). Many studies have shown that Ad-based vaccines are more efficient in generating antitumor immunity than vaccines based on other delivery systems (Basak et al. 2000;Okur et al. 2011). However, PEI to human Ad2 and 5 and their natural liver tropism substantially compromised the utility of these viruses for vaccine development. These hurdles justify implementation of various strategies for \"shielding\" of hAd vectors from PEI, including utilization of alternate Ad serotypes, xenotypes, or chimeric Ad vectors (Hedley et al. 2006b) described in previous Sects. 8.3. 2.1 and 8.3.2.2). The \"shielding\" approach involves hAd capsid genetic and chemical modification strategies as well as the use of hAd vectors in conjunction with cell-based therapies (ex vivo pre-loaded DCs). Administration of hAds through mucosal surfaces, preventing rapid vector clearance by immune system, represents a powerful alternative to the vector \"shielding\" approach.\n\nTo bypass the problem of PEI to hAd2/5 in human populations, alternative serotypes from humans or nonhuman primates have been employed for vaccine development. Human Ad35 has been proposed as an alternative to hAd5 for vaccine delivery because of its low seroprevalence. However, hAd35-based vectors demonstrated lower immunological potency as compared to hAd5 vectors in mice and nonhuman primates. Similar results were obtained for hAd11, hAd24, and hAd34 (",

            "text": "In the setting of a new pandemic threat, without the advantage of time and prior knowledge of viral pathogenesis and experience with viral growth and attenuating determinants, it is likely that traditional live-attenuated or whole-inactivated vaccine approaches developed by classical methods would not be rapid enough to respond to a pandemic crisis. Therefore, we suggest that the focus for vaccines  against EIDs should be based on newer gene-based antigen-delivery technologies, some of which have not yet been licensed for use in humans. Also, in a crisis in which development timelines need to be compressed, using technologies that can provide a candidate vaccine that is based on information derived entirely from target-gene sequences will be more expeditious than procedures that require isolation and growth of a virus that might require high-level containment. This means that even for families of viruses for which there are licensed vaccines, additional approaches beyond liveattenuated and whole-inactivated vaccines should be explored. In parallel, conventional vaccine approaches could be developed as an alternative solution that might be needed in the long term. \n\nTypically, vaccine development is measured in decades. However, since 2009, new technologies have evolved that have provided the tools for reimagining an accelerated process of vaccine development 23 . Key technologies that have changed the pace of vaccine development include the rapid isolation of human monoclonal antibodies [24][25][26] , the ability to define atomic-level structures of viral surface proteins and how they are organized on viral particles 12,[27][28][29][30][31] , next-generation sequencing to characterize both the virus and the repertoire of the host immune response 32 and methods for defining epitope-specific immune cell phenotypes with more precision at a single-cell level (Fig. 1). Techniques for identifying human monoclonal antibodies by cloning genes encoding paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains from sorted B cells has been particularly transformative. This method can help define antibody lineages associated with disease progression or immunity and provide precise endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity. In addition, monoclonal antibodies are critical reagents not only for assessing the antigenicity of new immunogen designs but also for development as clinical products for passive prophylaxis or therapy.",

Immunostimulants, such as IFN-\u03b1, were the first recombinant products that nonspecifically boosted the immune system to attack cancer cells. In addition to individual use, IL-2, for instance, is being employed as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines to increase the immune response. Currently, many formats of antibodies and their fragments are dominating the market due to high specificity and good clinical response, whether used singly or in combination with drugs, toxins or radionuclides. Moreover, cancer vaccines are promising in spite of many studies that did not show high effectiveness in humans. Therapeutic vaccines are the most challenging, but experts are developing techniques to obtain better results, such as by treating the patient's own cells in vitro and reinserting the cells into the bloodstream. Thus, cancer immunotherapy is progressively more individualized and is approaching a future in which there will not be just one solution to cancer but rather many solutions to cure or prevent malignancies. These advances would not be possible without biotechnology support and especially bioengineering. Since the initial hybridoma technology was developed until more recent techniques, many recombinant drugs have been designed with more specificity, more effectiveness and fewer side effects. Furthermore, several organisms have been used to reach those objectives, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, insects and plants. Although there are only 21 recombinant drugs approved by the FDA for anticancer therapy, many more are in clinical trials and should be on the market in the next few years, inaugurating a new era in cancer treatment. \n\nin the development of these antibodies, such as the high cost and the long time between engineering and approval.

Due to safety reasons, vaccines based on whole pathogens are being replaced by subunit and recombinant antigens and in this context, protein antigens and their epitopes are produced by the recombinant DNA technologies which make use of DNA sequence coding for the antigenic protein of the pathogen [3]. In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates [4]. In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen [5,6]. Undoubtedly, investigation of the effect of dose of antigens on murine models before vaccine development is an important goal. Immunization protocols in mice models will integrate the biological complexities of the immune system and gives a maximum prediction of the efficacy as well as adverse effects [7].

            "text": "Novel technologies currently under investigation represent the most valuable tools to be applied in vaccinology and could be used today for addressing the medical needs of the twenty-first century. Despite decades of efforts and investigation, satisfactory vaccines have not yet been developed against several of the most life-threatening infections, including tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, which claim the lives of more than 4 million people worldwide each year. The high levels of variability of their antigenic proteins and the required induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses have not allowed us to use conventional vaccinology methods as successful strategies. The advent of a new approach, named structural vaccinology, could represent today a valid revolutionary alternative leading in the next years to an efficacious vaccine design. Through the combination of human immunology, structural biology, and bioinformatics knowledge, antigenic epitopes are identified based on the protein amino acid sequences and the resulting secondary and tertiary structures. The principle is based on the observation that an efficacious immune response does not require the recognition of the entire antigenic protein, but the recognition of multiple selected epitopes might be sufficient to induce protective immunity (42). Progresses in technologies aimed at interrogating the human B cell repertoire are providing for the first time the possibility of isolating broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting relevant conserved epitopes (43)(44)(45). A deeper characterization of the crystal structure of an antigen in complex with protective antibodies represents the launching point for immunogen design to select relevant epitopes from a vaccine standpoint. Once identified they can be expressed in a recombinant form and in an immunodominant fashion to be used as potent immunogens (Figure 2). Recently, the group of Kwong et al. (46) using a structure-based approach designed an immunogen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that elicits higher protective responses than the postfusion form of the fusion glycoprotein, which is one of the current leading RSV vaccine candidates entering clinical trials. Importantly, highly protective responses were elicited in both mice and macaques. Structural vaccinology combined with human immunology are therefore rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative strategy for the rational design of engineered vaccines bearing multiple antigenic epitopes offering the opportunity",

Human polyclonal antibodies produced in transgenic animals offer an alternative to nonspecies-specific antibodies, and several groups are developing such platforms (11,21). Additionally, trivalent mixtures of recombinant human monoclonal antibodies with high neutralization potencies for BoNT/A are also being developed for therapeutic use (6,18), and researchers plan to adopt the same strategy for the neutralization of the other six BoNT serotypes.\n\nRapid vaccination of rabbits. Knowledge of the efficacy of an accelerated vaccination scheme may be useful for achieving the optimal production of human antibodies in transgenic animal platforms. The antigenic potencies of three nontoxic BoNT/B derivatives (rHc and two toxoid preparations) were examined in a vaccination study with three groups of NZW rabbits. An accelerated vaccination scheme of biweekly dosing was used to rapidly elicit the most potent immune response possible. Rabbits were also boosted with active purified toxin during the later stages of the study to determine whether the toxin neutralization response could be further enhanced. Serum was collected from immunized animals 1 week after each vaccination dose and assessed for toxin recognition by ELISA and for neutralization by mouse challenge assays. By the conclusion of the 15-week study (all animals were exsanguinated on study day 105), rabbits from all three vaccination groups had produced neutralizing antibodies of various potencies to BoNT/B.\n\nThe development of BoNT/B antiserum, as assessed by ELISA, was rapid for animals vaccinated with the two different toxoid preparations. This apparent parallel immune response proved to be quite distinct when toxin neutralization was examined. Compared with formalin toxoid, alkylated toxoid elicited neutralizing titers more rapidly, and the titers were of roughly 10-fold greater potency. These results are consistent with the results of a previous study in which mice vaccinated with alkylated toxoid produced BoNT/B-neutralizing antibodies of 600-fold greater pot",

            "text": "Detection of antibodies against infectious agents is an important part of basic and clinical research. For clinical diagnosis, the detection of antibody responses to some pathogens provides a sensitive assay for current, as well as past, infections. Antibody responses are also used to evaluate specific clinical symptoms associated with some pathogens. In vaccine research, antibody titers to specific proteins of an infectious agent often correlate strongly with the extent of protection afforded by the vaccine. Identifying protective B-cell responses against antigens, particularly against conformational epitopes that provide broad-spectrum protection against a given infection, are also critical for vaccine development and monitoring. The identification of antigens that induce the most effective immune response and which are the most diagnostically useful can be a daunting task. Improved approaches to increase both the spectrum of antigens tested and the quality of humoral responses detected has tremendous potential for many of these types of studies. \n\nAlthough routine detection of antibodies is generally performed one antigen at a time by ELISA, there is increasing interest in studying antibody responses to whole proteomes for some infectious agents. While the availability of full genomic DNA sequences to many infectious agents has provided a framework to systematically identify antigenic targets, significant challenges remain to study antibody responses to Analyses of humoral responses against different infectious agents are critical for infectious disease diagnostics, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and the development and monitoring of vaccines. While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers.",

By targeting critical immune components, reverse vaccinology complements the work done with MVA and other platforms, ensuring that vaccines elicit robust CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses, crucial for recognizing and eliminating infected cells. Additionally, potent B-cell responses lead to the production of neutralizing antibodies, providing long-term immunity. For instance, Bhattacharya et al. (2022) utilized immunoinformatics methods to design a vaccine targeting multiple virus epitopes, optimizing its ability to induce a solid and comprehensive immune response (50). Current vaccine strategies, including those for viral vector-based vaccines, have demonstrated both T-cell and B-cell mediated responses, contributing to their protective efficacy. While this reverse vaccinology approach has not yet been explicitly tested in viral vector-based vaccines, the principles of epitope design could be applied to enhance the effectiveness of such vaccines. Similarly, Ullah et al. ( 51) demonstrated how immunoinformatics analyses can predict vaccine constructs' stability, immunogenicity, and non-allergenicity, which could also be leveraged to improve the formulation of viral vector-based vaccines (51). \n\nIntegrating these approaches accelerates vaccine development and creates safer and more effective vaccines for combating monkeypox and other emerging pathogens. Combining these innovative methods promises to transform the vaccine landscape as we progress, offering more adaptive and targeted strategies to combat viral outbreaks.",

The data from clinical research with poxvirus recombinant vaccines so far demonstrate induction of humoral and cellular HIV antigen-specific immune responses in humans. In many preclinical experiments, varying degree of protection against homologous immunodeficiency virus infection has been found, predominantly depending on the challenge virus/animal model used for evaluation. However, HIV has an extraordinary genetic diversity and the \"Holy Grail\" AIDS vaccine would have to cross-protect against different HIV clades. A major scientific challenge is now to find appropriate antigens or epitopes that elicit a cross-protective immune response. For some time, induction of cellular immunity was the primary focus of HIV vaccine development but the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies is also believed to be indispensable [56]. Concurrently, data from two studies in the macaque model showed that booster vaccinations with oligomeric or native Env proteins enhance Env-binding and virusneutralizing antibody responses primed by recombinant MVA vaccines, and suggest that such antibodies are indeed likely to play a role in vaccineinduced protection [57,58]. Hepatitis C is another global health problem caused by a chronic virus infection that still lacks a preventive vaccine, and substantial efforts are currently dedicated to preclinical research in animal model systems [59]. The immunogenicity of the first poxvirus vector vaccines based on recombinant Canarypox virus and recombinant MVA have been tested in HLA-transgenic mouse models [60,61]. \n\nThe threatening episode of suddenly emerging coronavirus infections in humans causing severe acute respiratory syndromes impressively demonstrated the suitability of recombinant poxvirus vaccines to quickly evaluate candidate vaccines against a previously unknown pathogen [62,63]. Thus, in view of the current struggle to tune-up well established but rather too simple vaccine technologies for preparation against the global threat of an influenza pandemic, it is tempting to look into the possible usefulness of poxvirus vectors for development of more potent third generation influenza virus-specific vaccines.",

In the 1970s, varicella zoster vaccine was developed based on the principles of virus attenuation by passage in guinea pig cells. The 1980s were marked by the emerging of two important strategies for vaccine development: the conjugation of bacterial capsular polysaccharides to proteins and the recombinant DNA Technology, also known as genetic engineering. The first strategy was important in the initial development of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and later in the development of conjugated vaccines by coupling diphtheria toxoid to the H. influenzae type b capsule and diphtheria or tetanus toxoids conjugated to meningococci and pneumococci, which were very efficacious to almost eliminate the diseases caused by meningococci and pneumococci in countries that used these vaccines. The second strategy led to the development of a vaccine against hepatitis B virus, the first to use genetic engineering approach, and then other vaccines were developed like the vaccine against human papillomaviruses, lyme disease, rotaviruses and yellow fever. Thus, the advent of the recombinant DNA technology opened a new era for the development of vaccines [124]. \n\nRational development of vaccines began to be used in the mid-20th century, when immunology advanced to a point of distinguish protection mediated by antibodies and that mediated by lymphocytes and when passage in cell culture permitted the selection of attenuated mutants [130]. Later, other tools and approaches have been used to develop successful vaccines, such as protection studies in animals, by inference W.G. dos Santos from immune responses with demonstrated protection against repeated natural infection [131], and from the use of passive immunization (antibodies) against specific antigens to verify if those antigens should be included in vaccines. However, along the history of vaccine development became clear that the success of a potential vaccine candidate depends on understanding of which type of immunological response is protective.",

To date, however, little is known about the cell-cell fusion-inhibitory phenotype of these nAbs. For NiV vaccines the development of fusion-inhibitory responses may correlate significantly with immunity, since syncytia cell formation has consistently been observed in the infected tissues of experimentally infected animals [29,[49][50][51][52]. Using a homologous prime (day 0) and boost (day 21) regime, our NiV-F and NiV-G vaccine candidates were inoculated into pigs and blood samples were taken every week until 42 days post-vaccination. Sera from some of these vaccinated animals, as well as from an adjuvant-only control group, were examined for cell-cell fusion-inhibitory Abs. mFIT results from single representative animals from each group demonstrate that a fusion-inhibitory response is generated by both NiV-F and NiV-G vaccines pre-boost and that this response is significantly boosted following the second inoculation of the recombinant protein on day 21 (Fig. 3d).",

            "text": "For a long time, the generation of a humoral immune response by an attenuated vaccine was considered sufficient and the most important correlate of vaccination with protection. However, new generation PPR vaccine candidates have been developed worldwide in the past several years, which will probably serve as alternatives to conventional vaccines in the future. These candidates, especially viral vector vaccines, have been developed in China and have been proven to have the ability to induce humoral protection in vivo. Goat poxvirus-vectored PPR vaccine, a promising candidate DIVA vaccine, was developed. High levels of long-lasting neutralizing antibodies were induced in more than 80% of vaccinated goats and sheep over 6 months and protected animals from virulent PPRV challenge [51]. Recently, recombinant PPRV was studied using reverse genetic techniques, which might provide a useful tool for investigating biology and pathology and developing new vaccines. Recombinant PPRV stably expressing GFP was constructed and replicated as well as the parental virus, allowing a more rapid and higher throughput assessment of viral neutralization antibody via the virus neutralization test (VNT), as well as the development of new vaccines [52]. Furthermore, a recombinant PPRV expressing the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 gene (rPPRV/VP1) was generated without impairing immunogenicity by inducing the production of a neutralizing antibody against PPR in goats [53]. In addition, a suicidal DNA vaccine based on the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicon expressing the PPRV H gene was constructed. It induced the production of neutralizing antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation responses in mice, suggesting that it might represent a promising new approach for vaccine development against PPR [54].",

To assess vaccination routes for optimum delivery of r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA* immunogens, we constructed two r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA* vaccine candidates expressing the immunogens SIV Gag or anthrax PA. Our PCR-based approach confirmed the integration of the foreign genes encoding the immunogen in the recombinant Listeria strain, and the culture showed r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA* shared similar growth kinetics with the parental strain (data not shown). To characterize the ability of recombinant r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA*/Gag or r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA*/PA to secrete immunogen protein, the recombinant was grown for 16 to 18 h in BHI medium and culture supernatants were collected for Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Gag and anti-PA antibodies as described previously (32). Gag or PA protein with a predicted molecular size in the supernatant was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) and indicated that recombinant r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA*/Gag and r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA*/PA were able to produce and secret Gag and PA, respectively. \n\nIntranasal vaccination of mice with r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA* vaccine candidates elicited robust cellular response in systemic sites, but the intraperitoneal or intravenous immunizations were more efficient for elicitation. We recently demonstrated that intravenous immunization of mice with r-Listeria \u232cactA prfA* vaccine candidates can induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses while remaining remarkably safe (32). In the current study, we sought to compare nasal mucosal vaccination and other vaccination routes to determine whether they would elicit similar r-Listeria vaccine immune responses.",

            "text": "One of the major challenges in vaccinology is the development of safe and effective vaccines that can protect newborns and infants against infectious diseases. Conventional vaccines are notoriously poorly immunogenic during the first months of life, inducing immune responses that are short-lived and heavily Th2 biased. Th1-type cell-mediated immunity is modest or absent, and the combination of these factors heightens the risk of intracellular bacterial infections1-3. Even though routine immunization of human infants starts at 6 to 12 weeks of age, several booster doses are needed to achieve protective immunity. Mounting evidence indicates that these poor responses are not due to intrinsic deficiencies of the neonatal immune system, which has a fully constituted T cell repertoire and is capable of responding to antigens, but mainly to the presence of immature or \"inexperienced\" immune cells, particularly dendritic cells (DC), which have a limited capacity for antigen presentation and stimulation of na\u00efve T cells1, [3][4][5]. The field of neonatal vaccinology has experienced unprecedented progress in recent years, and the literature supports the assertion that newborns are indeed capable of mounting potent adaptive immunity, including adult-like Th1-type immune responses to vaccine antigens, provided that these antigens are administered with the appropriate stimulatory signals1-3,5-7.\n\nIn this study, we examined the possibility of priming the neonatal immune system through mucosal immunization using a novel antigen delivery system consisting of non-living, nongenetically modified cell wall particles derived from Lactococcus lactis. These particles, referred to as Gram-positive Enhancer Matrix (GEM) particles, are produced by the heatacid treatment of freshly grown L. lactis, a process that removes the DNA and most of the bacterial proteins, but leaves the peptidoglycan (PGN) envelope intact8,9. Multiple antigens can be displayed on the particle surface using recombinant protein and affinity technology: recombinant fusion proteins containing a vaccine antigen and a PGN protein anchor domain that binds with high affinity to the bacterial PGN, are produced in a suitable host-cell, purified, and then combined with naked GEM particles. The recombinant proteins bind tightly to the GEMs, creating antigen-displaying particles",

So, to overcome all these problems, continuous efforts being made toward the development of vaccines based on DNA and recombinant proteins that exhibit lesser side effects 25 . \n\nThe latest advances in recombinant DNA technology and recombinant protein purification techniques have simplified the production and assessments of complex novel proteins. Many of the BoNTs have been engineered in an effort to produce novel classes of therapeutic molecules 26 . These new generation recombinant vaccines would eliminate the need of specialized manufacture facility and could alleviate the problems related to toxoid vaccine. Some laboratories are involved in the development of recombinant protein vaccines using holotoxins, HCs and LCs. There have been several reports available elaborating the protective potential of holotoxin based vaccines against BoNTs 25,27,28 . Smith and co-workers reported an inactive BoNT/A1 holotoxin protein that provide greater protective potential upon 1,000 LD 50 toxin challenge 29 . Recently, Webb et al. demonstrated the consistent potencies of trivalent formulation of ciBoNT/C1, /E1 and /F1 (triCEF) against both monovalent and polyvalent toxin challenges found effective as an adjuvanted vaccine at 4-8 \u00b0C for up to 2 years 30 . \n\nIndeed, most of the studied targets are HC based which, by directly blocking the binding activity of toxin, consistently show satisfactory protection levels 14,31 . However, efforts have been made to develop vaccine against BoNT/E-LC where, Christine et al., reported development of humanized recombinant BoNT/E-LC antibody displaying neutralization capacity of 5\u00d7 MLD of BoNT/E at micromolar concentrations 32 . These reports that account for providing protection-using LCs are supported by two reasons; (1) LCs evokes protective antibodies, and (2) produce antibodies that possess the counterintuitive property of blocking toxin action at nerve endings. These combined findings form a rational basis for determining how anti-light chain antibodies including cytokines neutralize botulinum neurotoxins.",

            "text": "This is the case for the treatment of acute infections, emerging viral diseases and influenza pandemics, but the benefit is controversial, and robust treatment data are lacking [7]. Thus, polyclonal heterologous antibody fragments (horse, sheep and rabbit) continue to be used in a number of niches, such as rabies, digoxin toxicity and envenoming treatments. The preparation of these therapeutics has taken advantage of several technological developments made over time, but it has largely missed the recombinant therapeutic antibody revolution of the past decades, which allows one to create novel formats of antibody fragments, whose functional and structural properties can be adjusted in vitro for specific applications [8,9]. In this way, recombinant antibodies are emerging as a new class of drugs with extremely high potential in a wide range of therapeutic applications, primarily autoimmune/inflammatory, oncology and, to a lesser extent, neovascular, infectious, hemostasis and transplant rejection [10]. In 2012, among 15 top-selling drugs, six were antibody-based molecules, and global sales of antibody-based therapeutic products exceeded 50 billion U.S. dollars. Many other therapeutic antibodies are in the pipeline, with more than four hundred in various stages of clinical trials, and several biosimilars are already under evaluation [11]. In this context of fast development, it is surprising that the treatment of envenoming has not yet taken advantage of such improvements, even if a number of preclinical studies clearly demonstrated the potential of anti-toxin recombinant antibody fragments. \n\nIn this review, we focus on improvements over time in the production of conventional antivenoms and alternatives that could now be considered in light of recent progress. Our goal is to review the state of the field and to identify areas where these novel recombinant biomolecules represent opportunities with additional value in terms of efficacy and safety.",

            "text": "In view of the spread of microbial resistance to antibiotics and the emergence of new pathogens, passive immunisation by recombinant antibodies is viewed as one of the most promising alternatives to combat infectious diseases (Casadevall 1998). The market for human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is growing at a forecast compound annual growth rate of 21%, to reach $16.7 billion by 2008 (Pavlou and  Belsey 2005). This market is heavily focused on oncology and arthritis, and immune and inflammatory diseases. The role of antibodies for mitigation and therapy of infectious diseases is only slowly emerging, but is impeded by high Cost of Goods. High Cost of Goods for recombinant antibodies has so far also prevented their successful introduction into the animal health market. Plant-based production provides a solution to these cost problems. In addition, plants provide an adequate system for oral delivery of recombinant biomolecules as part of the diet. Infrastructure and costs for downstream processing can thus be avoided, as well as production losses which are often significant. Proof-of-concept for the expression of recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments in plants was demonstrated in the late 80s (Hiatt et al. 1989). Since then, different moieties have been generated ranging from single chain molecules (scFvs) to Fab fragments, small immune proteins (SIP), IgGs and chimeric secretory IgA (for rev. see Ma et al. 2005a). Despite progress in the production of antibodies in plants for human health, their application to the veterinary field is rather limited with most potential product developers focusing on vaccines (see earlier). However, recent encouraging developments have been reported in the field of passive immunisation. Focus has been on the generation and development of products for oral application in production animals, for prevention and/or therapy of some of the major commercially relevant infectious diseases. In most studies, the goal has been to apply the antibody molecule orally with no or limited purification thus making the product compatible with the already in place cost structures in the market for animal production. One major hurdle is the low concentration of the heterologous protein in the plant tissue.",

Conversely, vaccination of mice, rats, and rabbits with full-length RH5 (RH5_FL) induces high levels of functional antibodies that inhibit in vitro growth of all tested P. falciparum laboratory lines and isolates, 9,[13][14][15] notably with higher efficiency than other historical target antigens, such as merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). 13,16 Additionally, significant in vivo protection has been demonstrated against a stringent blood-stage P. falciparum challenge in Aotus monkeys. 17 These data provided momentum to advance RH5-based vaccines into clinical testing.\n\nExpression of RH5_FL protein proved challenging for a number of years, and, consequently, the first vaccine regimen that progressed to phase Ia clinical testing (VAC057; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02181088) utilized a recombinant prime-boost virus-vectored delivery platform that enabled in situ expression of RH5_FL by virally infected cells. 11 This regimen was well tolerated and induced functional antibodies that exhibited cross-strain in vitro growth inhibition activity (GIA). However, although the levels of anti-RH5_FL serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in this trial greatly exceeded those observed in naturally exposed African adults, they still only peaked at moderate concentrations of $9 mg/mL. 11 Notably, our study in Aotus monkeys predicted these to fall below a protective immunological threshold, and we therefore elected not to proceed to efficacy testing by blood-stage controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). 18 Indeed, protection in Aotus monkeys was strongly associated with anti-RH5_FL serum IgG antibody concentration and in vitro GIA measured using purified IgG, 17 with high-level protection only achieved when using a recombinant RH5_FL protein-in-adjuvant formulation. 17 Subsequently, we successfully expressed recombinant RH5_FL by using a Drosophila S2 stable cell line 19,20 (a platform compatible with human delivery) and were therefore able to in healthy adults in the United Kingdom, 18,22 with the booster vacci",

MVA is one of the most advanced recombinant poxviral vaccine vectors used in human clinical trials, 30 and elicits both humoral and cellular immune responses. 31 This latter point is particularly pertinent as there is no defined correlate of protection against CCHF virus so the priming of both arms of the immune system may offer the best opportunity to observe protective effects. The results of these studies confirmed the induction of both antibody and cell-mediated immunity and it is noteworthy that the Bulgarian vaccine based on suckling mouse brain (inactivated by chloroform, heated at 58 C, and absorbed on aluminum hydroxide) also induced T-cell and humoral immunity, 9 but efficacy of this vaccine has yet to be tested in animal models. For our studies, a homologous prime-boost approach was undertaken as we have demonstrated that this induced increased numbers of antigenspecific T cells compared to a single dose (data not shown). This finding is in line with others who have used similar approaches with MVA-based vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 32 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 33 Repeat administration with MVA allows reboosting of responses, despite induction of cellular and humoral immune responses against the vector. 34 his has been reported in Phase I/II therapeutic cancer vaccine trial. 35 as well as in a Phase I HIV vaccine trial. 36  This use of NP is in contrast to others who have opted to use the envelope glycoprotein as the candidate antigenic target. 10,11 While the external location of the glycoprotein makes it a favorable target for the induction of neutralising antibody, it has been recognized that there is not a strict correlation between in vitro neutralisation and in vivo protection of CCHF virus-specific antibodies. 37 The NP was considered to be an appropriate vaccine antigen, due to several characteristics. The NP in Bunyavirus infection has been recognized as the predominant antigen, inducing a high immune response. 13",

            "title": "A New Scientific Paradigm may be Needed to Finally Develop an HIV Vaccine",
            "text": "Since HIV is a very dangerous pathogen, the prospect of using a subunit vaccine was daunting, both in relation to manufacturing issues and because of potential risks to the vaccinated individuals. The response to this challenge was provided by the emerging science of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology, which provided the possibility of manufacturing large amounts of viral proteins without actually growing the virus. The most relevant precedent at that time was that of the vaccine against the hepatitis B virus. A highly effective plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine had been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981. However, concerns were rapidly raised because the source of the vaccine immunogen was the plasma of individuals who could also be carrying the AIDS virus. The solution came when the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus was successfully cloned and expressed in yeast, allowing for the manufacturing of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, which was licensed in 1986 (14,15). Thus, the first wave of HIV vaccine development, based on genetically engineered subunit envelope vaccines (16), was based on several past achievements of normal science: (a) the demonstration that the envelope glycoproteins of the virus are sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies; (b) the ability to manufacture large amounts of these proteins by genetic engineering techniques; and (c) the successful proof of concept provided by the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. \n\nThis initial vaccine effort also benefited from rapid advances in the molecular biology of HIV that occurred within 5 years after its discovery, including the identification of the major structural proteins of the virus, the cloning and sequencing of the HIV genome, early information on the genetic variability of different virus strains, the description of neutralizing antibodies, and the development of the first non-human primate models (17). \n\nAlthough in the late 1980s nobody knew for sure how long it would take to develop an HIV vaccine, it is also fair to say that the field was generally optimistic. The prediction was made, and repeated many times since then, that an HIV vaccine would be available within the next 10 years. However, no one knew at that time that HIV/AIDS was much more complex than any other viral disease for which vaccines had been successfully developed (18)(19)(20)(21).",

Advancements in manufacturing technology, speed and capacity have been achieved but vaccine effectiveness remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe a novel vaccine design strategy called immune engineering in the context of H7N9 influenza vaccine development. The approach combines immunoinformatic and structure modeling methods to promote protective antibody responses against H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) by engineering whole antigens to carry seasonal influenza HA memory CD4+ T cell epitopes \u2013 without perturbing native antigen structure \u2013 by galvanizing HA-specific memory helper T cells that support sustained antibody development against the native target HA. The premise for this vaccine concept rests on (i) the significance of CD4+ T cell memory to influenza immunity, (ii) the essential role CD4+ T cells play in development of neutralizing antibodies, (iii) linked specificity of HA-derived CD4+ T cell epitopes to antibody responses, (iv) the structural plasticity of HA and (v) an illustration of improved antibody response to a prototype engineered recombinant H7-HA vaccine. Immune engineering can be applied to development of vaccines against pandemic concerns, including avian influenza, as well as other difficult targets.",

            "text": "However, these vaccine candidates failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy, with no impact on blood-stage parasite multiplication rates observed in vaccinated UK adults following controlled human malaria infection administered by mosquito bite. 24 The vectors targeting both blood-stage antigens induced on average 20-50 \u00b5g/ml of antigenspecific serum IgG, 21,22 and it is likely these antibody concentrations were too low to mediate functional GIA in vivo. 7 ore recent preclinical studies have focused on combining viral vectored and protein-in-adjuvant vaccines in \"mixed-modality\" regimens, with the aim of maximizing the induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses. 18 In most cases, a recombinant adenoviral vaccine is used to prime the immune response, followed by boosting with MVA and/or protein. Studies of these regimens in mice or rhesus macaques with the MSP1 or AMA1 antigens have shown that these mixed-modality approaches can achieve antibody and T cell responses which equal, or in some cases surpass, the best immune responses achieved by either vaccine technology alone. 25,26 Priming with viral vectors also led to enhanced IgG antibody avidity and Th1-type IgG isotype skew in mice. 25,27 Preclinical data from the fields of HIV-1 [28][29][30][31][32] and liverstage malaria vaccine development 33,34 also show encouraging results from the combination of adenoviral-vectored and proteinbased vaccines. While undertaking the above mouse studies, we also reported that priming with a recombinant adenovirus followed by a booster vaccination with protein-in-adjuvant, greatly reduced the hierarchy of humoral immunogenicity that is typically observed when comparing protein vaccine adjuvants. In this case, relatively weak protein adjuvants such as aluminium-based salts, boosted antibody responses comparably to far more immunogenic formulations, in contrast to results observed when the proteinin-adjuvant vaccines were used alone. 27",

            "text": "In 1984, Georges K\u00f6hler and Cesar Milstein were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their development of hybridoma technology nearly a decade previously [16]. This pioneering technique provided the tools for the generation of monoclonal antibodies, mAbs (i.e., antibodies of a single specificity) and ultimately for their diverse application in scientific research and in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Hybridoma technology involves the fusion of B cells from immunized mice with myeloma cells to produce an immortalized cell line capable of continuous production of mAbs specific for a desired target. Early clinical studies with hybridoma-derived mAbs found that therapeutic administration resulted in the development of immune responses directed towards the murine proteins. These responses caused either a failure of therapy due to the blocking or neutralizing effects of the anti-mAb, antiidiotypic response [17] or immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Efforts to overcome these adverse effects were developed during the 1980s following the advent of recombinant technology. One such approach involved the production of chimeric antibodies in which the murine constant regions were replaced with human constant regions using molecular cloning [18,19]. An added advantage of the incorporation of a human Fc was their ability to interact with human Fc receptors and complement components thereby facilitating cooperation with the immune system. Although this represented a significant improvement in terms of treatment efficacy, chimeric antibodies also elicit anti-idiotypic responses. Subsequently, humanized antibodies were developed in which the hypervariable loops (CDR) from murine antibodies were grafted onto human framework (FR) regions [20] resulting in a marked reduction in immunogenicity. The first mAb licensed for use in humans was muromonab, a murine IgG2a antibody generated by hybridoma technology, which targets human CD3 to treat severe steroid-resistant transplant rejection [21]. Although effective, muromonab caused significant adverse effects due to (i) stimulation of potent T cell responses, (ii) the production of anti-mouse antibodies, reducing the efficacy of the treatment, and (iii) isolated cases of anaphylaxis. These ultimately led to its withdrawal from the market. Since then, 45 mAbs have been approved for use in humans in the USA. A further four are currently under review and many more",

            "text": "From the early practice of scarification to prevent smallpox through the creation of targeted, recombinant vaccines, the development of effective vaccines has been one of the great achievements in public health and medicine, resulting in millions of lives saved. Modern vaccines typically protect by eliciting immunity following exposure to an inactivated or attenuated whole pathogen or recombinant components of a pathogen [1]. This approach works well for diseases in which natural infection leads to immunity and protection against re-infection and has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and dramatic declines in such diseases as diphtheria, measles, and polio [2]. However, it has been more challenging to develop effective vaccines against diseases for which prior infection does not offer full future protection, such as HIV, malaria, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A [1].\n\nAlthough cellular immunity is certainly important, humoral immunity appears to play the most significant role in the protection associated with most vaccines [3]. Passive immunization achieved through the infusion of serum has played a significant historical role in the treatment and prevention of infection [4,5]. The recent development of hybridoma technology and humanized monoclonal antibodies have resulted in a new class of antibody-based drugs with demonstrated and potential efficacy in cancer, inflammatory diseases, addiction, and infectious diseases [6]. Within this context, there has been an increased interest in passive immunization utilizing monoclonal antibodies produced in plants or transgenic animals for infections such as Ebola virus and MERS-CoV [7,8]. However, logistical requirements including the need for high antibody concentrations requiring repeated injections due to the short half-life of antibodies, a cold-chain for delivery, and trained medical personnel for delivery create potential limitations to the use of this therapy, especially in low resource areas [1,9]. The development of passive immunization by gene therapy could be a solution to some of those logistical issues and holds potential promise as either an adjunct to standard vaccination in populations who do not generate a sufficient immune response or for pathogens able to evade current vaccination strategies due to antigenic variability.\n\nOriginally proposed as a concept in 2002 [10], passive immunization by vector-mediated delivery of genes encoding broadly neutralizing antibodies for in vivo expression has been referred to as Im",

Several different strategies have been explored to improve both antigen and antibody production, all of them depending on a successful expression and immunogenicity of the antigen. Gene fusion technology attempted to address these challenges: fusion partners have been applied to optimize recombinant antigen production in E. coli, and to increase protein immunogenicity. Taking a 12-kDa surface adhesion antigen from Cryptosporidium parvum (CP12) by example, the novel H fusion partner was presented in this work as an attractive option for the development of recombinant immunogens and its adjuvant-free immunization. The H tag (of only 1 kDa) efficiently triggered a CP12-specific immune response, and it also improved the immunization procedure without requiring co-administration of adjuvants. Moreover, polyclonal antibodies raised against the HCP12 fusion antigen detected native antigen structures displayed on the surface of C. parvum oocysts. The H tag proved to be an advanced strategy and promising technology for the diagnosis and therapy of C. parvum infections in animals and humans, allowing a rapid and simple recombinant production of the CP12 antigen.",

This trial consists of two substudies: Substudy A (SSA), involving approximately 48 vaccinia-na\u00efve participants receiving two doses of BNT166a 31 days apart across three dose levels, and Substudy B (SSB), with 16 participants who have a prior history of smallpox vaccination (vaccinia-experienced), following the same dosing schedule. The trial began with a sentinel group in SSA, followed by dose escalation and expansion cohorts. While the initial design included a second candidate, BNT166c (trivalent), this arm was not activated. Table 2 summarizes the essential details of these clinical trials, including vaccine type, trial phase, vaccination scheme, target populations, and the availability of results. \n\nThe analysis of vaccine platforms used in mpox development reveals distinct advantages and limitations across different technologies. Attenuated virus vaccines provide broad immune activation but carry risks such as reversion to virulence and require a cold chain. Non-replicating vaccines are safer for immunocompromised individuals but often elicit suboptimal immune responses. Viral vector-based vaccines offer durable immunity and can be developed rapidly, though they face challenges such as pre-existing immunity and complex manufacturing processes. Recombinant vaccines are safe and easy to store but may have lower immunogenicity without adjuvants. DNA vaccines are quickly developed and stable at room temperature but require advanced delivery systems. Lastly, mRNA vaccines are highly scalable and non-integrative but are associated with inflammatory responses and require an extreme cold chain for storage. Each platform must balance these trade-offs to optimize efficacy, safety, and logistical feasibility during vaccine development and deployment. Table 3 provides a comparative analysis of different vaccine platforms, highlighting their advantages and limitations.",

            "text": ", strategies for effective vaccines and therapies anticipate targeting populations at risk.\n\nDetection of serum antibodies corresponding to purified antigen can be readily performed using ELISA. However, for RTX and BoNT, the ELISA titer does not correspond to neutralization capacity, especially in comparisons between serotypes. For this reason, animal model systems have been utilized to correlate protection data for both toxins. While recombinant ricin vaccines generate an immune response and show promise as vaccine candidates in animal models, screening of B cell hybridoma libraries generated from immunized mice indicated \u03fd10% neutralizing antibodies (51). The lack of correlation between detection of an immune response and the presence of neutralizing antibodies necessitates understanding how to shift this balance in humans. As a result, attempting to predict protection in an immunized human group by antibody reactivity alone is not likely to prove helpful. In contrast, the use of tetanus toxoid vaccine has almost completely eradicated tetanus in developed nations (52). Found in soil, Clostridium tetani is a prevalent cause of maternal and infant mortality due to spastic paralysis in most of the unvaccinated developing world (53). The toxoid was created before a structure of tetanus toxin was available for use in conducting structure-based analysis; however, tetanus toxoid has proven to be effective because it elicits a protective response. This correlation between protection and the presence of antibody reactivity in immunized populations has allowed accurate monitoring and disease eradication in many developing countries (54).\n\nOverall, access to protein structure provides a reference point for integrating affinity and mapping data to accurately locate binding sites for neutralizing antibodies within a targeted protein toxin, as described by Mantis and coworkers, in comparison to the results previously possible using static approaches such as competitive solid-phase binding assay. We anticipate the utilization of additional high-resolution approaches to continue to enhance dissection of the molecular aspects of host-pathogen interactions beyond that of an antibody-antigen interaction with the continued enhanced efficiency of structural biological approaches, including cryo-electron microscopy (55) and structure-based protein informatics (56), as well as development of novel molecular tools such as camelid-based antibodies (57,58).",

            "text": "Antibodies accumulate somatic hypermutations and undergo affinity maturation upon exposure to antigens (1). Immunization exploits this mechanism to produce antibodies against the target antigens. Repetitive antigen injections introduce random mutations and increase the antigen affinity of the antibodies. The history of the mutational changes that occur in antibodies during immunization directly reflects the enhancement of the adaptive humoral immune response. We hypothesized that it will be possible to screen the antibodies reacting to the immunized antigen by tracking the evolution of an antibody along the time course of immunization. \n\nHigh-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) of vast immune repertoires provides useful information for immunological system research and its practical applications (2, 3). Unlike conventional sequencing techniques, NGS enables us to draw a comprehensive picture of immune repertoires that respond to antigens. The process of antibody development by immunization can be precisely examined by high-throughput sequencing of the samples collected during the course of immunization and reveals the time-resolved bird's eye view of antibody maturation. \n\nPrediction methods for antigen binding antibodies using sequence data from immunized animals have been developed based on the frequency of occurrence of the individual antibody sequences (4)(5)(6). The sequences are ranked by the number of sequence reads, and about 10 sequences at the top frequency of occurrence were picked as the candidates for objective antibody. The accuracy rates of this approach are quite high, where at least more than 75% selected candidates interacted with immunized antigen. The propensity-based approach is a simple and powerful way to discover antibodies from immunized animals, but by the very nature of this approach, infrequent antibodies are inherently omitted from the prediction. \n\nIt is difficult to link antibody repertoire development with the changes in protein level characteristic of antigen-responding antibodies. Despite the development of various empirical and bioinformatics technologies for nucleotide sequencing (7)(8)(9), correct light-chain and heavy-chain matching remains a challenging problem in the biophysical study of antibody obtained by high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, the preparation of full-length antibody from NGS sequence reads requires time-consuming recombinant strain construction and mammalian cell culture.",

            "text": "During the last decades, the development of subunit malaria vaccine candidates has been thoroughly pursued [46]. Although malaria vaccine development has been hastened by description of numerous candidates, no vaccine yet has provided a strong and lasting immune response [47]. Nonetheless, significant progress has been achieved as several malarial vaccines are currently undergoing pre-clinical and clinical trials [11,46,48]. Although more than 70 P. falciparum vaccine candidates are currently under development and 23 of theses are undergoing clinical testing, only a few P. vivax vaccine formulations are being assessed in pre-clinical studies, and so far, only two candidates (the CSP and the Pvs25) have been tested in Phase 1 clinical trials (reviewed in [49]). One of the most promising components for a malaria blood-stage vaccine is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) due to the efficacy observed after a blood-stage challenge in animal models [11]. The observation of a protective outcome demonstrated that vaccination of mice and monkeys with native [50] or recombinant AMA-1 [10,51] conferred protection from parasite challenge and induced antibodies that inhibit parasite growth in vitro [17,40,52]. These data have sparked interest toward the further clinical testing in humans; a few reports on Phase Ia trials in malaria-na\u0131 \u00a8ve subjects are already available for P. falciparum AMA-1 [53,54,55], and the results from ongoing and planned studies are expected in the near future for vivax malaria [17]. Although the success of this vaccine will be determined in field trials under natural conditions of parasite exposure, the continuous improvement of malaria vaccine design is still required. For instance, thus far, no recombinant malarial protein-in-adjuvant formulations have proved sufficiently efficacious to encourage further testing [56,57]. Moreover, the production of high-quality and correctly folded Plasmodium recombinant proteins is difficult [58]. \n\nIn the present study, our focus has been to characterize naturally antigenic B-cell determinants of the AMA-1 vaccine antigen in order to select future potential malarial subunit vaccines using bioinformatics tools and synthetic peptide technology.",

            "text": "During the past 10 years, antibodies and other proteins made by recombinant DNA technology came to dominate the pharmaceutical industry as 7 of the top 10 selling drugs in the US were engineered proteins in 2018. There are hundreds of monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical trials, however during the next decade, advances in protein engineering will likely lead the field beyond monoclonal antibodies. First, various bispecific antibodies have demonstrated improved activity over standard monoclonal antibodies. For example, the FDA granted approval to blinatumomab, a bispecific anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 antibody for use in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in 2014. A major issue currently debated is the choice of bispecific reagents versus chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. Bispecific antibodies have the advantage of a lower cost of manufacturing. However, it remains to be seen whether they can serve as a stand-alone therapy for advanced leukemia or serve as a bridge to a costlier procedure such as a hematopoietic transplant. Most recently, trispecific antibody technologies have been developed. It is likely that the molecule in the first clinical trial to test this technology will have specificities for CD38, CD3 and CD28, with the goal of simultaneously enhanced T cell activation through CD3 and CD28 and direct targeting of myeloma cells through CD28 and CD38 5 . \n\nAnother major advancement in the area of protein engineering was methods developed to achieve receptor-ligand orthogonalization. IL-2 is the principal growth factor for T cells and was approved by the FDA in 1992 for metastatic kidney cancer. However, a major limitation to the use of IL-2 has been deleterious effects associated with the IL-2 dependent expansion of regulatory T cells that diminishes the therapeutic effect. Sockolosky et al. engineered T cells to express an orthogonal mutant IL-2 receptor (ortho-IL2R) such that an orthogonal mutant IL-2 (ortho-IL2) would only activate the ortho-IL2R expressed by the engineered T cells 6 .",

            "text": "Vaccines represent one of the most successful chapters in the history of medicine. Over the past decades, the advent of recombinant cDNA technology has enabled the biomedical community to genetically engineer viruses for vaccine delivery purposes. As a starting point, this review evaluates the unmet medical needs, which drive scientists and industry to exploit such fundamentally new technology for human vaccination. The author discusses the molecular functioning, production and safety profile of replication-competent and -deficient viral vector systems, representing two fundamentally distinct classes of \"genetic vaccines\". Building upon this knowledge, he dissects the immunological mechanisms rendering immune responses to viral vectors qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from those elicited by non-live vaccination approaches. These mechanisms comprise (1) the vectors' innate immune recognition by the host cell, (2) potent priming of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as a result of dendritic cell targeting and endogenous protein synthesis, (3) conformational antigen display for protective antibody induction as well as (4) prolonged availability of substantial quantities of antigen. Deduced from these features, preferential indications for virally vectored vaccines are discussed, taking into consideration specific medical needs as well as risk-benefit assessments of replicating vector systems. The limitations and challenges in virally vectored vaccination must also be given careful consideration. Pre-existing and vaccination-induced anti-vector immunity can interfere with vaccine immunogenicity and prime-boost vaccination, respectively. Additionally, the requirement for eukaryotic production systems imposes technological as well as regulatory hurdles. Existing strategies to overcome these challenges are outlined. With the recent licensure of the first virally vectored vaccine this review seems timely to herald the introduction of virally vectored vaccines into daily medical practice.",

            "text": "Plague is an ancient disease that continues to be of concern to both the public health and biodefense research communities. Pneumonic plague is caused by hematogenous spread of Yersinia pestis bacteria from a ruptured bubo to the lungs or by directly inhaling aerosolized bacteria. The fatality rate associated with pneumonic plague is significant unless effective antibiotic therapy is initiated soon after an early and accurate diagnosis is made. As with all bacterial pathogens, drug resistance is a primary concern when developing strategies to combat these Yersinia pestis infections in the future. While there has been significant progress in vaccine development, no FDA-approved vaccine strategy exists; thus, other medical countermeasures are needed. Antibody treatment has been shown to be effective in animal models of plague. We produced fully human polyclonal antibodies in transchromosomic bovines vaccinated with the recombinant F1-V plague vaccine. The resulting human antibodies opsonized Y. pestis bacteria in the presence of RAW264.7 cells and afforded significant protection to BALB/c mice after exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. These data demonstrate the utility of this technology to produce large quantities of non-immunogenic anti-plague human antibodies to prevent or possibly treat pneumonic plague in human.",

            "title": "HIV Vaccine: Recent Advances, Current Roadblocks, and Future Directions",
            "text": "Ever since HIV was formally identified as the cause of AIDS, there have been ongoing efforts on vaccines against the disease. On April 24, 1984, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Margaret Heckler, announced that vaccines will be researched and made ready for preliminary testing by the year 1986 [7]. However, this initial optimism was criticized by many eminent researchers because it failed to be coherent with existing knowledge about the pathophysiology and the mechanism of the virus itself. Traditional approaches of using live attenuated or whole inactivated viruses were considered unsafe because of the risk of permanently integrating proviral DNA within host chromosomes [8]. Advancements in vaccine development had to wait until mid-1980s when recombinant DNA technologies were becoming available for research applications. Following the success of recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine, recombinant DNA technologies were also being researched for HIV vaccines [9]. Rapid advances in the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of HIV enabled many structural components and proteins to be discovered and artificially synthesized through recombinant DNA technology. The culmination was the cloning and sequencing of HIV genome which led scientists to believe that an effective vaccine could be developed in the future. However, all these efforts came to a standstill with growing knowledge about extreme mutability and immune evasion mechanisms of existing HIV strains [10]. This was further complicated by the fact that neutralizing antibodies had no protective effects and their titers were similar among asymptomatic carriers and patients with active disease [11]. The exact mechanism of immunity against HIV is a puzzle and still remains unsolved. Currently 3 scientific paradigms have attracted researchers and include induction of neutralizing antibodies; induction of CD8 T cell mediated immunity; and combination approaches [12]. \n\nIn spite of many nonmaterializing studies, hopes were renewed when a handful of studies presented newer approaches for inducing effective humoral and cell mediated immune responses against the virus. In a clinical trial done by Belshe et al. [13] in 1998, it was observed that live attenuated canarypox virus expressing HIV antigens were capable of inducing CD8 cytotoxic T cells against Env or Gag expressing target cells in 64% of the volunteers.",

The goal of antibody production technology is to achieve high-titers of highly specific, and highaffinity antisera. Antigen preparation and animal immunizations are carried out following the guidelines of production techniques via hybridoma technology and recombinant technology (Smith, 1985). Moreover, therapeutic antibodies have been developed by modulation to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptor function and contribution of Fc glycan to immunoglobins, and the regulation of the antibody glycosylation in relation to immunoglobins-based therapeutics (Shade and Anthony, 2013). \n\nHuman diseases have been known for ages. The comfort of global travel and better interdependence have supplemented layers of intricacy to comprehend infectious diseases. These life threatening contagions effect human health in relation to unpredicted illnesses, deaths, and interfere many other normal life activities. Moreover, the diseases take a significant human toll as well as cause public fear (Morens and Fauci, 2013). To date, limited knowledge is available on extended aspects of the production of antibodies by hybridoma technology, antibody engineering techniques, construction of antibody fragments, display technologies, and their extended applications (Fauci and Morens, 2012). Therefore, to cope these health threats and limitations, extraordinary advances in hybridoma technology and antibody engineering techniques for the development of countermeasures (diagnostics, and treatment by therapeutic antibodies) have been discussed in the present review. Additionally, widespread antibody applications have been described in detail for pursuing a healthier future for humans, and to live a happy life.",

            "text": "Just as DNA microarray technology spurred the development of functional genomics, the development of immunomic microarray technology is driving the emerging field of functional immunomics (reviewed in ReF. 114). The goal of immunomics is to provide a detailed understanding of host immunological responses to foreign antigens through the use of high-throughput technologies and computational methods. The technologies that are central to this effort include antibody microarrays (consisting of antibodies as probes and antigens as targets), peptide microarrays (consisting of antigen peptides as probes and serum antibodies as targets) and more recently peptide-MHC microarrays (consisting of recombinant peptide-MHC complexes and co-stimulatory molecules as probes and populations of T cells as targets).\n\nAntibody microarrays are used to measure the concentration of specific antigens (such as cancer antigens), whereas peptide-MHC microarrays can map MHC-restricted T-cell epitopes which are involved in helper and regulatory functions of the immune system. Peptide microarrays are used in various applications, including B-cell epitope mapping and detection and diagnostic assays. Peptide microarrays are also being used in vaccine studies for mapping epitopes associated with effective immune responses and for testing the ability of experimental vaccines to generate specific antibody responses against those epitopes after immunization and challenge 115 . Studies of immune responses that are associated with different clinical outcomes, such as those of patients who are HIV positive and who rapidly progress to AIDS and those of infected long-term survivors, can also provide direction for the development of vaccines 116 . It is probable that immunomics will become an increasingly integral part of a systems-biology approach to vaccine development and of obtaining a better understanding of host immunity to virus infection.\n\nAnimal models. We have used functional genomics to evaluate a live influenza virus vaccine in a macaque model, in which attenuation of the virus was accomplished by truncation of the gene encoding NS178. This modification eliminates or reduces the ability of the NS1 protein to antagonize type I IFN production 79 and, in mouse and swine models, such attenuated live viruses are immunogenic and protective 80,81 . gene",

            "text": "Antibodies are well recognized as proteins of therapeutic value and are important therapeutically for a wide range of diseases, such as autoimmunity and cancer therapy. As such there are many efforts ongoing in order to improve the effector functions of therapeutic antibodies. Several modified antibodies are used in the clinic or evaluated in clinical trials. Although none of the reported antibodies are capable of curing cancer as a single agent, (Chames and Baty, 2009) specific antibodies can improve the clinical outcome of cancer, autoimmune disease, transplant rejection or can bind toxins (e.g., snake venom toxins). The use of therapeutic antibodies is reviewed elsewhere (Leader et al., 2008). \n\nExtensive research has been conducted in order to produce humanized N297 N-glycosylated IgG antibodies. This N-linked glycan affects the therapeutic properties of antibodies by recruiting innate immunity effector cells and serum proteins, such as complement system proteins. Recruitment of these effectors can lead to targeted cell death, which is a desirable property in cancer immunotherapy. Many efforts have been made and several systems have been developed [mammalian, non-mammalian expression systems, like the GlycoFl-engineered P. pastoris from GlycoFi, mentioned before (Li et al., 2006)] to obtain glycosylated IgG antibodies. Although N-linked glycosylated N297 is the natural glycosylated residue found in human IgG antibodies, unglycosylated antibodies can be produced in E. coli and some of these recombinant antibodies are in clinical trials. So far, all clinically approved therapeutic antibodies have been produced in fused mouse myeloma cells or Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells (Jung et al., 2011). Despite the fact that no approved therapeutic antibodies are from E. coli origin, E. coli still remains an attractive system to produce non-glycosylated antibodies and continuing efforts are made to scale up the production including methods that use heat-inducible expression (Bayly et al., 2002) and metabolic engineering (Makino et al., 2011). \n\nAnother example of ongoing developments includes the production of Iclonals.",

This conventional trajectory involves distinct stages such as animal immunization, meticulous screening for viable genetic material, and the antibody replication process guided by the central method. Simultaneously, a meticulous analysis has been conducted to scrutinize the intricate challenges embedded in three critical phases at the current research stage. These phases encompass the immunization stage, where the acquisition of specific immunogens, notably membrane proteins, poses considerable challenges, 46 compounded by the extended duration of the immunization cycle. The effective screening of the genetic material stage encounters the formidable challenge posed by the most advanced single B cell high-throughput screening technology, demanding extensive efforts in recombinant expression and subsequent validation. Lastly, the antibody replication stage contends with the existing foreign monopoly on high-expression cell lines, resulting in homogeneous antibody replication that lacks diverse core competencies beyond the realm of production capacity. \n\nIn response to the aforementioned technical challenges, we propose a groundbreaking approach for the next-generation development of diagnostic monoclonal antibodies and implement it comprehensively. From an immunological perspective, an examination of the vaccine development history reveals that conventional vaccine research entails prolonged cycles, rendering it inadequate for the rapid response demands of emerging infectious diseases. The advent of RNA vaccines, utilizing the genetic code of viruses to 'trick' human cells into producing proteins identical to those on the pathogen's surface, presents an unparalleled advantage in swiftly addressing novel infectious disease outbreaks. 47 Employing the RNA vaccine model not only effectively resolves the issue of acquiring challenging immunogens but also enhances the original conformation of immunogens by bypassing traditional steps of immunogen replication or purification, theoretically elevating the effectiveness of the immune response. From a cost perspective, this approach significantly reduces both the development cycle and the expenses associated with immunogen acquisition (Figure 3). Examining antibody sequence discovery, despite prevalent views that single B cell high-throughput platforms accelerate antibody development, [9][10][11][12][13] these platforms undeniably pose significant challenges in terms of downstream replication and validation.",

            "text": "Recombinant antigens have become a key component in the development of next-generation vaccines, particularly in response to emerging infectious diseases such as mpox. These antigens are produced by expressing viral proteins in platforms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, insect cells, or mammalian cell lines like CHO cells (de Pinho Favaro et al., 2022). Once purified, these proteins serve as antigens that stimulate the immune system to recognize and respond to the infectious agent. Intriguingly, recombinant antigen technology is advantageous in vaccine production due to its scalability, high yields, and costeffectiveness (Khalid et al., 2024). \n\nA recombinant vaccine targeting antigens from MPXV was developed by Gao et al. (2023). Their first assessment aimed to determine whether vaccination with MVA could induce antibodies that cross-react with antigens from MPXV. The experiment was conducted on BALB/c mice that received two doses of MVA on days 0 and 21 at different viral concentrations, including 10 5 TCID 50 /mL, 10 6 TCID 50 /mL, or 10 7 TCID 50 /mL. Researchers collected serum samples from the vaccinated mice, as those samples contained the antibodies produced after MVA immunization. The serum from the MVA-immunized mice was used in ELISA assays in order to test if the antibodies would bind to A29, A35, B6, H3, I1 and M1 despite the fact that MVA does not express these specific antigens. These results suggest that given the high similarity between MVA and MPXV, the neutralizing antibody response induced by MVA immunization is likely to cross-react with MPXV. Additionally, the highest immune responses occurred with the 10 7 TCID 50 /mL concentration (the highest dose) (Gao et al., 2023). \n\nIn the second phase of the study (Gao et al., 2023), recombinant versions of MPXV antigens were synthesized using CHO cells. Although M1 and A29 elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses, researchers decided to include other antigens such as A35, B6, H3 and I1 for further investigation.",

            "text": "In this work, IFN-\u03b3 production served as read-out for this type of immune response. In vivo and ELISpot experiments have demonstrated that recombinant influenza A viruses induced HPV16 E6-and E7-specific CTL that produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to stimulation with short E6 and E7 peptides for five weeks, irrespective of the vaccine administration route (s.c. or i.t.). In contrast, animals vaccinated with recombinant VLPs exerted significantly less potent IFN-\u03b3 responses upon stimulation with E6 and E7 peptides as compared to recombinant influenzavaccinated mice. As possible explanation, the immune responses against VLPs may be primarily of T H2 type, contrary to T H1 -driven immunity induced by recombinant influenza viruses. \n\nGenerally, induction of a humoral immune response by therapeutic vaccination is not desired as it may have unwanted adverse effects. A cell-mediated immune response against target antigens E6 and E7, but no HPV16 E6-or E7-reactive antibodies were detected in sera from recombinant influenza virus-immunized mice. Sera contained antibodies directed against H1N1 or H3N2 influenza virus strains, thus underlining the advantage of using different influenza vaccine strains for prime and boost immunizations. \n\nRecombinant influenza A viruses were designed for therapeutic vaccination against HPVinduced disease and thus to induce primarily a cell-mediated immune response. Nevertheless, the prophylactic efficacy of recombinant influenza virus was also evaluated in vivo, using a well-established murine TC-1 tumor model. Interestingly, tumor cell challenge of 16E6E7 influenza virus-vaccinated mice resulted in significantly lower mean tumor volumes when compared to mock-treated mice (p < 0.001), or in complete protection against tumor development (50% of animals). In contrast, animals immunized with 16E6E7m virus could not sustain protection: 7 of 8 animals had developed palpable tumors 35 days after TC-1 challenge. Overall, tumor growth was significantly reduced in all animals vaccinated with recombinant virus prior to challenge.",

Moreover, neutralizing antibodies against NiV were induced in all hamsters inoculated three times with these recombinant viruses (Fig 4B). In parallel with the increase in neutralizing antibodies during the three immunizations, an increase in IFA antibody titers was also observed (Fig 4C). However, the levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by one or two inoculations of each recombinant LC16m8 were relatively low or below the detection limit, although IFA antibodies were detected in most hamsters except for the hamsters inoculated once with LC16m8-G (Fig 4C). The levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by LC16m8-based vaccine candidates in the present study were similar to those induced in hamsters inoculated with the NYVAC-based vaccine expressing the NiV glycoprotein in a previous study [13]. However, the number of viruses in the vaccination solution was slightly higher in the previous study (e.g., 2 \u00d7 10 6 viruses were immunized in the experiment shown in Fig 4B, whereas 10 7 viruses were immunized in the previous study). Moreover, pre-immunization with VV was performed in the current study, as shown in Fig 4B , but not in the previous study [13]. Although we had already demonstrated that the LC16m8-based vaccine for SFTSV provided protection against its lethal challenge, the protection rate was decreased in the VVpreimmunized mouse [39]. This suggests that pre-existing immunity to VV inhibits the induction of antibodies to foreign antigens (such as NiV glycoproteins) expressed in VV-based recombinant vaccines.",

            "text": "In this study, we set out to investigate whether displaying the recombinant F4 adhesion protein FaeG on highly immunogenic cVLPs could improve the vaccine-induced anti-FaeG antibody responses in pigs and provide enhanced protection against PWD. Although the cVLP display significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of recombinant FaeG, effective immunization of piglets was almost completely inhibited, most likely due to the presence of maternal antibodies. However, FaeG.cVLP was able to generate strong humoral responses when utilized as a sow vaccine, and these antibodies were effectively transferred to piglets via colostrum intake. As the need to develop alternatives to the use of antimicrobials grows, vaccines targeting the bacterial causes of enteric diseases in pigs will be essential. This study provides a proof of concept for the use of cVLPs in swine vaccines. However, it also highlights several of the major challenges currently limiting piglet vaccination. While we demonstrated that the Tag/Catcher cVLP technology has the potential to enhance the systemic humoral responses elicited towards poorly immunogenic antigens in pigs, this effect is dependent on the absence of pre-existing maternal immunity. As interference by MDAs seems unavoidable for FaeG-containing vaccines, future studies should look to alternative antigen targets where pre-existing maternal immunity will not be a factor.",

            "text": "DMAb technology is a notable delivery alternative as DMAb produced from muscle cells in vivo and purified monoclonal antibodies manufactured in vitro confer similar levels of protection against lethal influenza infection in mice. Plasmid DNA lacks limitations posed by pre-existing anti-vector serology and the DMAb platform may be utilized repeatedly to deliver additional anti-influenza antibodies to combat viral escape, or antibodies aimed at entirely different pathogens. 16,17  lasmid DNA also has little risk of genomic integration (reviewed in ref. 24) and similar plasmid designs have demonstrated safety in DNA vaccine human clinical studies. 25 NA plasmid-based delivery of monoclonal antibodies provides conceptual advantages at each step of the supply chain. In production, DMAb are inexpensive relative to protein monoclonal antibody (and viral vectors) because DNA replication does not require mammalian cell culture. DNA is simple to scale up and stable for storage, a particularly important consideration in resource-limited settings. The potential for long-term DMAb expression with sustainable passive immune protection against influenza infection may circumvent the need for frequent recombinant antibody injections. Long-term expression of DMAb can be further augmented by emerging antibody half-life extension technologies. 26 Conceivably, inoculation with influenza-specific DMAbs may have utility to augment a vaccine campaign, generating almost immediate prophylaxis against severe influenza infection while allowing for an adequate vaccine-induced immune response to mature. DMAbs may also provide a vital option for severely immune impaired individuals incapable of mounting functional active immune responses. DMAb technology is an exceptionally compelling tool warranting further exploration for sustained protection against severe infection by diverse strains influenza A and B viruses, as well as further investigation against infectious diseases more generally.",

            "text": "DIVA vaccine, also termed as marker vaccine, can induce an immune response which is different from that induced by conventional vaccine. DIVA vaccination is one of the most promising strategies based on subunit technology, where well-defined and highly purified recombinant proteins (antigens) can raise a protective immune response against infection. The development of an efficacious subunit vaccine (marker vaccine) based on recombinant secretory proteins of MAP needs a combination of antigens appropriate for the broad range of varied MHC molecules present in an immune-competent outbred ruminant population (Derrick et al. 2004;Cai et al. 2005;Sable, Verma, Behera, et al. 2005;Sable, Verma, Khuller, 2005;Grover et al. 2006). Immune responses to recombinant antigens of MAP have been studied and demonstrated the protective effects of recombinant MAP antigens in mice (Chen et al. 2008) and calves (Kathaperumal et al. 2008). In the latter study, protective efficacy of recombinant antigens was assessed for 85A, 85B, SOD and Map74F antigens in a goat model. While MAP is intracellular in nature, a Th1 response mediated by IFNg-secreting sensitized T-cells plays a major protective role similar to other mycobacterial infections (Flynn et al. 1993;Flynn and Chan et al. 2001;Koets et al. 2002;Skeiky et al. 2004). Here, recombinant secretory antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation was detected after 3 weeks of booster vaccination, which was significantly higher in the vaccinated groups than control groups, indicating the induction of recombinant antigen-specific cellular immunity. Immunization of goats with the recombinant secretory antigens gave a sustained antibody response for a prolonged period. The study indicated that the recombinant secretory antigens stimulated both CMI and humoral immune response. After booster vaccination, antibody response was significantly increased in animals vaccinated with recombinant secretory antigens compared with unvaccinated control group.",

The inherent structural diversity of FP on the prefusion-closed Env trimer thus appears to mirror the conformational diversity of FP coupled to carrier protein, with antibodies elicited by conformationally diverse FP immunogens still able to recognize and neutralize FP in the Env trimer context. We note that the ability to elicit broad HIV-1 neutralizing responses with an established vaccine technology has multiple advantages, including the prior development and clinical assessment of multiple carrier proteins.\n\nSeveral toxoids, including those derived from diphtheria and tetanus toxins, are components of carrier protein vaccines [16][17][18][19] , and recombinant versions of each have been developed. rTTHC, a well-characterized fragment of TT that is produced by recombinant DNA technology and can be manufactured as a GMP product. rTTHC retains the most potent T helper epitopes of TT and could induce higher immune response than the assembled KLH nanoparticle, which is ~150-fold larger than rTTHC in molecular weight. As combinations of carriers did not improve immunogenicity (Fig. 4), rTTHC appears to contain sufficient T helper epitopes that could not be substantially improved by either cocktail or sequential addition of other carrier proteins.\n\nWhile FP-carrier protein priming is important for initiating FP-directed responses 12 , Env trimer boosts are also important to mature the responses into potent broad neutralization 1,2,12 . Furthermore, our results suggest that compared to Adjuplex, use of Alum as an adjuvant resulted in slower development of anti-FP responses during the FP8v1-rTTHC priming stage, though these responses continued to develop upon trimer boosting, ultimately yielding similar responses as induced by Adjuplex at the end of the study. Our findings highlight that using multiple FP primes and multiple trimer boosts can eventually achieve the desirable immune response even with detectable different response after the FP primes using different adjuvants.\n\nAlthough there is no substantial impact on the elicitation of immune responses among the conjugates with variable conjugation ratios, our data suggest that the group",

The use of recombinant DNA technology allows the targeting of immune responses focused against a few protective antigens. The conventional recombination methods for generating vaccines are time-consuming, laborious, and less efficient. To overcome these limitations, a new precise CRISPR/Cas9 with high efficacy, specificity, and low-cost properties has solved a lot of current problems of recombinant vaccines that intrigued the inspiration for novel recombinant vaccine development. CRISPR/Cas9 system was discovered as a bacterial adaptive immune system. In the domain of virology, CRISPR/Cas9 is used to engineer the virus genome to understand the fundamentals of viral pathogenesis, gene therapy, and virus\u2013host interactions. One step ahead CRISPR/Cass9 bypassed the vaccine to precisely engineer the B-cells to secrete the specific antibodies against deadly viral pathogens. There is a critical literature review gap especially in the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to generate recombinant vaccines against viral diseases and its prospective application to engineering the B-cells in immunocompromised people. This review heights the application of CRISPR/Cas9 compared to conventional approaches for the development of recombinant vaccine vectors, editing the genes of B-cells, and challenges that need to be overcome. The factors affecting CRISPR/Cas9-edited recombinant vaccines and prospects in the context of viral genome editing for the development of vaccines will be discussed.",

            "text": "A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to establish immunity to a disease. Vaccination has been one of the greatest revolutions in medical science and has dramatically improved the quality and length of life expectancy. Although vaccines are the most cost effective form of disease protection in healthcare, their cost is still too excessive for many people in the world, especially in developing countries. Vaccines can be therapeutic, to overcome an infection already established, or prophylactic, to prevent a future infection. The aim of vaccination strategies is to obtain efficient and safe vaccine formulations to induce a long lasting immunity against various pathogens. To achieve this goal, the vaccine component should generate not only a neutralizing antibody response, a long-term memory B cells stimulation, but also a T cell mediated immunity to eliminate infected cells which represent the pathogen reservoirs. Recombinant subunit vaccines, based on a single protein (antigen) or a single peptide (epitope) derived from the pathogen, are particularly attractive strategies when compared to classic inactivated, attenuated or live recombinant vaccines. Recombinant subunit vaccines offer potentially equivalent efficacy but are much safer and in some cases easier to produce. Plants offer unique advantages for the production of subunit vaccines in terms of scale, speed, costs, yield, and safety. The first work that describes the expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in stable transgenic tobacco in 1992 marked the beginning for developing low cost vaccine formulations in plants (Mason et al., 1992). Researchers focused on expressing their antigens in edible plant tissues as oral vaccines, opening a new prospect for vaccine delivery (Mor et al., 1998). Since then, many research groups have adopted this system and carried out studies in the areas of improving target protein expression levels, analyzing the administration route and schedule, choosing the appropriate animal models, and exploring the use of possible adjuvants. \n\nThe first report in this area described the expression of the FMDV structural protein VP1 with a TMV-based gene insertion vector (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999). A yield of approximately 0.15 mg/g FW was achieved and subsequently the antigen was administered to mice without further purification. All mice immunized intraperitoneally developed a protective immune response against experimental challenge with virulent FMDV.",

This paper explores the innovative strategies and technologies driving the evolution of antibody engineering and their diverse applications in the treatment of various diseases.Antibodies, key components of the immune system, have emerged as powerful tools for targeted therapy due to their exquisite specificity and versatility. Over the years, significant progress has been made in the design and optimization of antibodies, leveraging advances in biotechnology, protein engineering, and computational modeling.The design phase of antibody-based therapeutics encompasses a range of approaches, including the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) through hybridoma technology, phage display, and recombinant DNA techniques. These methods enable the production of antibodies with tailored properties, such as enhanced affinity, specificity, and stability, to target specific antigens associated with disease.In addition to their traditional role in treating infectious diseases, antibodies have revolutionized the field of oncology with the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These next-generation therapeutics offer novel mechanisms of action, enabling targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents, immune cell activation, and modulation of immune responses against cancer cells.",

            "text": "It is crucial to bear in mind that these applications are examples of continued research and development in the field and with advancing technology and discoveries, there are increasing opportunities for using both polyclonal IgYs and recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. Some ongoing applications include Target therapeutics (IgY Monoclonal antibodies), R&D uses, & Diagnostic Applications. An interesting way of targeting cancer therapy is through the creation of recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. This comprises the use of antibody-drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These antibodies can attach to antigens associated with tumors selectivity, destroying tumor cells or activating the TherapeuTic advances in vaccines and immunotherapy immune system. 131 For instance, diagnostic techniques used to detect biomarkers for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular infections have resorted to recombinant IgY monoclonal antibodies. 18,30,142,143 In the absence of a chicken myeloma fusion-partner cell line suitable for chicken hybridoma production, two ways can be chosen for selecting monoclonal IgY: either the antibody library approach involving methods such as phage display, ribosome display or yeast display or single B-cell cloning. 3,30,144,145 Recombinant mAbs require less animal usage than normal polyclonal IgY's. This is because more animals are needed only before getting an antibody library ready. Furthermore, stable CHO cell lines' developed antibodies exhibit a short manufacturing cycle with minimal batch-to-batch variation. Recombinant TK1 antibodies can now be purchased. However, none of these serum biomarkers have been proven useful in health screening or clinical oncology yet. 107 Wang et al. 107 conducted their investigation using a new automatic chemiluminescence sandwich-BSA platform and found out that the Human Thymidine Kinase 1 (hTK1)-IgY-rmAb assay is user-friendly and suitable for large-scale health screenings. Antibody mimetics might become an alternative to traditional antibodies in different biomedical applications where they are simply ineffective. Ge et al. 146 revealed that antibody mimetics may find diverse biomedical uses, particularly when conventional antibodies fail.",

Serum taken from human volunteers vaccinated with a new acellular plague vaccine (containing recombinant proteins rF1 and rV) was assessed for protective efficacy by passive transfer into mice. Mice were subsequently exposed to a lethal aerosol of plague and the delay in mean time-to-death measured. This process was shown to be reproducible and these data indicated that Hsd:NIHS mice may be a better model than BALB/c mice for passive transfer studies with human serum. \n \nThe last two papers in this special issue describe research on a generic DNA vaccination approach and a potential immunotherapy treatment for Ebola. S. Qiu and colleagues constructed DNA and recombinant Tiantan vaccinia (rTTV) vaccines encoding OVA-CTB fusion protein. They concluded that, following studies in mice, using an intranasal DNA prime and intramuscular recombinant-vaccinia boost, that fusion-expressed CTB could serve as a potent adjuvant to enhance both systemic and mucosal T-cell responses. S. Dowall et al. describe early studies using in vitro models to investigate potential targets for immunomodulatory therapy during infection with the highly infectious Ebola virus. They showed binding of the phosphatidylserine-targeting antibody (bavituximab), which has already progressed through clinical trials (phases I-III) for treatment of tumours, to the surface of host cells infected with Ebola and also to purified Ebola virions. Assessing immune therapies for other indications has the potential to allow repurposing of products for treatment of biodefence agents, potentially saving significantly on research and development time and costs. \n \nIn conclusion, this special issue has surveyed a diverse range of approaches to the development of biodefence vaccines and therapies and has explored the likely impact and application to the field of exciting new technological developments. \n \n \nJulia A.

The state of monoclonal antibody technology now makes is possible to replace human sera by custom-tailored human monoclonal antibodies, thereby solving the safety, cost and supply problems inherent in blood products derived from human donors. However, only a few biotech companies have currently taken mAbs for HIV, hepatitis B, C, CMV and RSV infection in preclinical or clinical development. Economically, monoclonal antibodies are seen as less attractive antivirals than small molecule drugs due to the approximately two-fold increase in cost and time required to produce clinical-grade material. Scientifically, the possibly limited breadth of protection, generation of immune escape variants and uncertain clinical efficacy in case of established acute or chronic infection are perceived as major obstacles to the development of mAb products for control of viral infections. \n\nWe speculate that several of the antiviral mAbs which have produced unsatisfactory results in preclinical or clinical studies were not optimally selected. Based on our own data and published evidence we therefore propose a paradigm shift, predicting that a broad-scale screening for synergistic action of antibody cocktails as stand-alone or in combination with antivirals may solve many of the above outlined problems. Crucial to the discovery process of highly potent antiviral mAbs is a high-throughput screening based on in vitro or ideally in vivo neutralization, which should systematically investigate the possible neutralizing synergy of noncompeting antibodies. Synergy of the mAbs with antivirals could also be included in an early screening step. If the potency of an individual antibody needs to be increased, selection for an improved k on should be performed. Novel antibody formats based on multimerization of antigen-binding fragments may lead to molecules with high avidity and increased neutralizing potency. \n\nImportantly, the state of recombinant antibody technology offers a unique opportunity to rapidly counteract epidemic threats of newly emerging diseases. It took less than a year to discover human mAbs which protect against SARS-coronavirus in different animal models and could be used for human ring vaccination in case of an outbreak or a bioterror attack.",

            "text": "recombinant protein applications. Until recently, various recombinant proteins, peptides and vaccines have been produced in E. coli as it involves less tedious and laborious, cost-effective yet robust processes [148,149].\n\nWhen multiple M2e-NP subunits assemble and oligomerize into particles, the overall number of M2e peptides present in the vaccine increases, which boosts the antigenicity and immunogenicity of M2e. Furthermore, the ability of NP to activate CD8+ T cells, Th and humoral responses is also transferred to the M2e. Altogether, the chimeric M2e-NP protein can stimulate greater humoral and cell-mediated responses, which in turn confer a broader, long-lasting protection against a wide spectrum of influenza strains [150]. The importance of vaccine-induced memory CD8+ T cells in minimizing influenza virus replication has been proven empirically [151]. Vaccine recipients manifested less severe symptoms with significantly improved clinical outcomes [152]. Similar observations describing the protective role of memory CD8+ T-cells were also documented in other animal models and human subjects challenged with influenza H1N1, H7N7, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses [150,153,154].\n\nBesides the recombinant protein approach, delivery of M2e-and/or NP-based DNA vaccines using viral vectors is also described elsewhere [155]. The DNA vaccines induce protective immunity against influenza in recipients [156,157]. Delivery of NP and M2 DNA in conjunction with the adenovirus backbone protected mice challenged with a lethal virus dose [158]. It therefore bolsters the notion that protection induced by NP and M2 proteins concurrently is superior to that induced by a single protein or antigen [159,160]. Nonetheless, the use of DNA vaccines has been limited by its complex immunization processes and the production of DNA-and vector-specific antibodies [161]. The anti-vector antibodies may interfere with the immunization outcomes [162]. Moreover, the safety issue concerning chromosomal DNA mutation due to the integration of heterologous DNA molecules is still debatable [161]; as a result, the application of DNA-based vaccines requires rigorous empirical evidence to authenticate their safety profile and efficacy.",

            "text": "The first recombinant antibodies were developed by Georges Kohler and Cesar Milstein in 1975 using the hybridoma technology 200 . Recombinant antibody technology since then has become a potential therapy for snakebite envenomation. They are more effective because of their neutralizing capacity and reduced side effects such as anaphylactic reactions compared to animal serum-based antivenoms 198 . Using this technology, several antibody formats have been obtained in chimeric and humanized versions, whose therapeutic use is approved by the FDA in treating several diseases 201,202 . \n\nThe hybridoma technology, nevertheless, has several disadvantages. The main one is related to the development of human anti-mouse antibodies that cause allergic reactions and decrease the lifetime of the therapeutic antibody 203 ; however, this is still the most widely used technique for antibody production. Production of antibodies involves an immunological process in which the antigen undergoes proteolytic degradation, so the derived antibodies will not distinguish the antigen in its initial form 204 . Therefore, researchers work to find other technologies that solve these drawbacks and do not activate the complement system. \n\nAntibodies for therapeutic purposes like IgG have a longer life and are more permeable 205 . Recombinant antibodies have various formats in the structure; they are assembled according to different combinations of heavy and light chains 206 . The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and fragment antigen-binding 137 are the most commonly used formats because of their high affinity to the antigen, structural stability and shorter generation 207 . \n\nCurrently, several studies demonstrate the efficacy and therapeutic potential in neutralizing various snake venoms using recombinant antibodies of multiple formats, e.g., camelids nanobodies against the poison of B. atrox 208 and C. durissus terrificus 209 ; scFv against the venom of Bothrops pauloensis 210 and L. muta 211 . Recombinant antibodies, such as scFv and nanobodies, are FDA approved for treating the diseases, except for the treatment of snakebite envenomation 212 . In addition, the FDA and European Medicines Agency EMA has not approved the production of recombinant antibodies in E. coli 189 .",

In this study, it was found that 29 proteins are able to induce antibacterial antibodies. One of these antigens is PorA, the antibody produced against which has shown very high bactericidal activity. The results of this study showed that recombinant PorA protein plus Freund's adjuvants and OMV promote antibody responses and stimulate both bactericidal and opsonic activities (26). \n\nTo date, one of the problems in the design of vaccines, especially vaccines based on recombinant proteins, is poor immunogenicity, for improvement of which adjuvants should be used (27). One of the other existing technologies is the production of fusion protein-based vaccines. This approach, unlike monovalent technology, has proven to be more likely to produce extensive protective immunity against meningococcal strains. The use of fusion protein technology allows the use of two different antigens that play important roles in the development of meningococcal infections (28). \n\nThe results of this study revealed that serum IgG antibodies against PorA protein of N. meningitidis serogroups A and B increased significantly in the immunized groups compared with the control groups. The serum IgG antibody levels significantly increased in the groups receiving PorA plus Freund's adjuvant compared with the groups receiving PorA plus OMV. The results also revealed that the serum IgG antibody levels in the groups receiving fusion protein PorA (A + B) + FA increased significantly more compared with those in the other groups as well as in the group receiving fusion protein PorA (A + B) + OMV.",

The results showed this fusion protein generated antibody response against both toxins in mice; although antibody production against TcdA was protective even without adjuvant, antibody titer against TcdB was not enough for protection. Also, the vaccination of hamsters with the adjuvanted vaccine was protective. Then, the fusion protein with alum hydroxide, as an adjuvant, was tested in a non-human primate model. The fusion protein was tested in a clinical trial (phase I) and induced antibodies against TcdA and B (95). The RBDs of TcdA and TcdB + flagellin of S. typhimurium were used for stimulation of the immune system in mice. Based on the results, the recombinant toxin-based peptides vaccine adjuvanted with S. typhimurium flagellin could protect laboratory animals challenge (96). On the other hand, flagellin from C. difficile has been measured by ELISA in the culture of cell lines and was proved as an effective vaccine in the occurrence of C. difficile disease (97)(Table 3). \n\nRecombinant technology is a non-toxic, high-throughput, and promising tool for vaccine development; however, it is not a fully advantageous process. Production of insoluble recombinant proteins is time-consuming and difficult with multiple stages of solubilization and refolding. Bacterial remains such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), present in the recombinant toxoid purifications, are another uncertainty about the worldwide use of these vaccines (1). Also, the need for addition of adjuvants still exists.",

Additional, structural glycomics techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and compositional (and linkage) analyses of glycoproteins can be used to analyse protein-specific glycosylation, along with traditional blotting and microscopy techniques for localization and distribution studies (Jurberg and Brindley, 2015;Hokke and Van Diepen, 2017).\n\nA separate platform for vaccine antigen delivery/presentation is the use of antiparasitic DNA vaccines, especially for veterinary medicine. These types of vaccine platforms have mostly been applied to protozoal and helminth parasites of medical and veterinary importance with some promising evidence for use in ticks Guerrero et al., 2014;Wedrychowicz, 2015;Qian et al., 2016;Tebeje et al., 2016;Noon and Aroian, 2017). Currently, only a single plasmid vector has been approved for human DNA vaccine design (Halstead and Thomas, 2011), and a limited number of DNA vaccines have been commercialized against viral pathogens and cancer treatment (e.g., Oncept R , Merial Inc.) in animals (Wahren and Liu, 2014;Finocchiaro and Glikin, 2017). For metazoan parasite vaccines, however, these types of vaccine strategies appear only to be used for initial antigen screening purposes (e.g., expression library immunization) or as pre-clinical evaluations (as either sole or prime-boost strategies) in spite of the availability of newer technologies (e.g., minimized non-viral vectors) (Hardee et al., 2017). Consequently, these strategies appear to be largely abandoned toward final commercialization in favor of recombinant protein vaccines with proper formulations Merino et al., 2013;Wedrychowicz, 2015;Qian et al., 2016;Tebeje et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Future vaccines will be minimalistic in approach by focusing on key parts of the pathogen, such as regions containing epitopes that cover antigenic diversity and, thus, will target immunologically similar subgroups of the human population and multiple pathogen variants. This is evident from the trend observed in evolution of vaccine strategies, which has seen a shift from whole organisms to recombinant proteins, and further towards the ultimate in minimalist vaccinology, the peptide/epitope/multiepitope based vaccines. The minimalist approach is also expected to cover the safety concerns that are associated with the traditional vaccine approach of using whole organism (Sette and Fikes, 2003;Dertzbaugh, 1998). Vectored vaccines, suitable for 'combination immunization' that are produced by recombinant DNA technology and contain multivalent minimal antigens to protect against multiple infections, are considered to be the future of vaccinology (Kutzler and Weiner, 2008). The future will bring increased integration of vaccine research with advances in immunology, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, informatics, and high-throughput instrumentation, collective defined as the emerging field of \"vaccinomics\", which is hailed to be responsible for the next 'golden age' in vaccinology (Poland et al., 2008). Awareness of the novel technological possibilities in vaccine research is also expected to grow. Future vaccinology will be based on detailed understanding of immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses (using adjuvants) and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets (Brusic et al., 2005). To achieve this, vaccine development will routinely be conducted through large-scale functional studies supported by genomics, proteomics, and informatics techniques prior to clinical trials. This will provide an increased range of immune targets for vaccine design. The author expects the emergence of new generation of vaccines to be personalised to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the disease agents. In summary, vaccinology will experience rapid progress and will eventually deliver benefits to patients from improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.",

            "text": "Vaccines play a pivotal role in host protection against infectious diseases and have significantly reduced mortality worldwide. However most of vaccine candidates have failed to completely protect individuals from emerging and re-emerging diseases/agents, with many diseases, such HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, being not yet preventable by vaccination. Hence, the development of new vaccine formulations is of fundamental priority. Several strategies have been developed over the years in order to achieve this goal, and the recent advances in the field of vaccine technology may provide valuable insights for the rational design of next-generation vaccine delivery systems. Historically, vaccinology has relied on the use of live attenuated, killed/inactivated, toxoid and subunit vaccines with most of them currently available on the market. Many live attenuated vaccines are able to stimulate humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses, by mimicking the natural infection. However, some concerns still remain to be addressed when using attenuated/inactivated vectors as vaccines, including safety, instability and weak immunogenicity. Alternative strategies have been developed to provide safer and more effective vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology could be a useful approach, mainly due to the ability of DNA vaccines to elicit different types of immune response, providing many advantages over traditional vaccines in terms of safety, stability, costs of production, and ease of manufacturing. However, until now DNA vaccines have not been successful in non-human primates and humans. Recombinant viral vectors represent an attractive tool to deliver antigen and to stimulate stronger immune responses than DNA vaccines, with the majority of current clinical trials for gene therapy using viral vectors; however, biosafety and pre-existing immunity concerns must be taken into account when using viral vectors as vaccine. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have arisen as promising vaccine candidates over traditional vaccines, mainly due their ability to elicit robust immune responses without toxicity and anti-vector immunity, even though these formulations suffer of problems of stability and conservation. Given this scenario, we have been studying in the past decade a delivery system based on a protein scaffold formed by a 60-mer assembled over the domain of the E2 component of the PDH complex from Geobacillus stearothermophilus.",

Hence, OMV-based adjuvants were comparatively superior to aluminum adjuvants only for triggered B cell immunity.\n\nSome valid strategies already existed for the effectiveness of OMV adjuvants formulated with virus or tumor vaccines. Among them, studies involved in HIV were the most comprehensive.\n\nOMV-based adjuvants could effectively enhance induction of IFN-\u03b3and IL-4 and further promote Th1-oriented responses (Alatrakchi et al., 2002). Further, OMVs combined with Viruslike particles (VLP) as an immune complex significantly induced high anti-HIV IgG production, particularly with IgG2a dominancy. In addition, a study reported that N. meningitidis MenB OMV as an adjuvant was promising in AIDs vaccine development (Aghasadeghi et al., 2011). Furthermore, a recent experiment decked OMVs with tumor antigens that elicited protective anti-tumor responses in immune-competent mice. The engineered OMVs offered synergistic protective activity, resulting in OMV platform that was particularly attractive for cancer immunotherapy (Grandi et al., 2017).\n\nNoticeable advances in the process of proteomic and genetic engineering have led to a concern about the development of recombinant vaccines. OMVs have been attractive candidates for recombinant vaccines, since they are novel vaccine delivery platforms that enhanced recombinant engineering (Mohan et al., 2013;Afrough et al., 2017). Since the initial procedure of most biosynthesized bacterial glycans is similar, it was practical to design glycoengineered OMVs (geOMVs) as bacterial vaccine platforms. GeOMVs could display the O-antigen and surface glycans from different bacteria; thus, they could be effectively formulated with vaccines to prevent a wide array of bacterial infections (Szymanski et al., 2016;Valguarnera and Feldman, 2017). Another genetic engineering strategy involved genetargeting technology. Plasmids could be transported into OMVs and further modify OMV lumen content, including both LPS functions and attenuated toxicity. The newly designed rOMVs could be used as a more skillful immune mod",

The HI assay against the PR8 (H1N1) virus was carried out by means of antisera collected from the mice (n = 3) immunized with RID-HAgD (4 mg/mouse) or RID-eGFP (as a control, 4 mg/mouse), along with an Alum adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via the intraperitoneal route. The mouse antisera against RID-HAgD showed detectable levels of HI titers and NT antibody titers, whereas those from the RID-eGFP group failed to show such an activity (Fig. 7B, C). The HI activity appeared to be similar, regardless of the origin of the RID docking protein. Therefore, with the use of mRID-HAgD (20 mg/mouse), HAgD without RID (15 mg/mouse), and PBS, detailed analyses of immune responses were conducted after prime-boost immunization (n = 5) via the intraperitoneal route (Fig. 7D, E). As shown in Fig. 7D, E, boost immunization with mRID-HAgD (20 mg/mouse) augmented the immune responses, and high HI titers (.32) were achieved by the second boost immunization, whereas the NT antibody levels (.10 3 ) correlated with the HI antibody levels. The multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID did not generate HI or NT antibodies to the PR8 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 7D, E). Antisera from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with 1 mg of the rRID-HAgD recombinant vaccine (Fig. 7F, G) showed higher HI titers (.64) and higher NT antibody levels (.40) than those shown by mouse antisera (Fig. 7B,  C). The control rabbit antisera against the RID-eGFP proteins or PBS showed neither the HI ability",

A total of 21 products have been approved in the USA, with additional products being marketed outside the country, and over 200 monoclonal antibody candidates are currently under clinical investigation (19). Biopharmaceuticals, driven by large profit margins, is likely to be the mainstream of pharmaceutical R&D in the coming years. For example, avastin, which is manufactured by Genentech and clinically prescribed for the treatment of lymphoma and carcinoma of mammary glands, showed a 41% increase in sales within 3 months, with sales revenue amounting to 1.1 billion US dollars (20). The sophistication of genetic engineering and bioprocess technology has made possible the mass production of biopharmaceuticals such as insulin and human growth hormone. In 1987, the FDA approved the first genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine for human use. Since then, genetic engineering and bioprocess technology has been adopted in the manufacture of a number of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. In addition to biopharmaceutical development, recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology has been applied to diagnose such devastating diseases as cancer (21), Alzheimer's disease (22), diabetes (23) and cystic fibrosis (24), and to develop therapies to address these conditions whose clinical management remains problematic and challenging. \n\nDevelopment of genetically-modified (GM) foods is another area where rDNA has important applications. GM foods such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton seed oil, with desirable traits, such as increased resistance to herbicides or improved nutritional content, have been put on the market since the early 1990s (25). Future applications of GM foods can be therapeutically-related -for example, GM bananas that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B (26). While the practicality or feasibility of commercial production has yet to be fully tested, the next decade may see an exponential increase in drug-related GM products.",

The recombinant DNA technology offers the possibility of developing new immunization strategies. This paper describes the development of a subunit vaccine through the expression and purification of the E. coli K88 FaeC fimbrial protein. The gene that codes for this antigen was amplified by PCR and cloned into an E. coli expression vector fused to a 6X histidine tag. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and used for mice immunization. In parallel, the same gene was cloned into an eucariotic expression vector with the addition of the Kozak sequence for improving translation of this gene in muscle cells. The resulting plasmid named pUP310 was purified in large scale and used to immunize mice. The immune response afforded by both forms of immunization was monitored by ELISA. There was an immune response in mice inoculated with pUP310 and purified FaeC. It was possible to detect anti-FaeC antibodies 42 days after the first inoculation. The antibody titer increased with time, being still detectable 7 months after the first inoculation. It is concluded that recombinant FaeC and pUP310 are potential tools for immunization of swine against E. coli K88.",

D' Aoust et al. (2009) in a review summarized that plant-based recombinant HA ectodomain in fusion with carrier proteins or other peptides can be produced by agroinfiltration and can induce haemagglutination inhibition antibody response in model animals. \n\nHowever, they observed that in all the plant-based research works reviewed, high dosage and multiple injections were required to induce immune response which is a drawback to this approach. It is important however to analyze that compared to the safety concerns associated with the direct use of influenza virus in vaccine development, high dosage administration is a lesser evil as rHA0 antigens can easily be mass produced in plants to meet demand. Purification of the recombinant HA antigen and its administration together with other recombinant influenza virus derived antigens such as NA, NP might be a solution to the high dosage drawback. \n\nAnother attractive approach developed by some authors is the plant-based transient influenza virus-like particle formulation capable of producing VLPs with Yakubu et al. 29 unprecedented speed. It has been discovered that rHA0 easily accumulates in the producing tissue as VLPs and this led D' Aoust et al., (2008) andD'Aoust et al.

We are learning that it is increasingly difficult to keep traditionally separate fields (e.g., oncology, inflammation, immunology) as cleanly parsed as they once were thought to be. As our understanding of how processes integrate within a cell and on a whole-organism basis, we are learning that the fields are ever more intersecting and overlapping. So it is with antibody immunotherapy and vaccinology. This year, for the first time in this conference's 27-year history, we are introducing talks and sessions on vaccinology. To that end, this session is predominantly devoted to disease scenarios where there is a preexisting therapeutic antibody, and for which there is now a vaccine in development that is directed to the same target. What are the advantages of a vaccine over the antibody? This will be discussed on a case-by-case basis. \n\nOne such example is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is the target for several anti-hypercholesterolemia monoclonal antibodies in late-stage clinical development. Bryce Chackerian (University of New Mexico School of Medicine) will talk about the potential clinical and financial advantages of developing PCSK9 as a vaccine target for the same indication. Similarly, Yanelys Morera (Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Cuba) will discuss the development of the established monoclonal antibody cancer target, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a vaccine. Kai Xu (University of Maryland School of Medicine) will discuss development of vaccines for the treatment and prevention of heart failure. \n\nA novel example of combining active/passive immunotherapy strategies involves the development of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Administration of an RSV vaccine in infants is unsuccessful due to their immature immune system. Hence, antibody therapy/prevention has been the only treatment route. Gregory Glenn (Novavax) will discuss the development of an RSV vaccine for use in new mothers, to pass along passive immunotherapy to their nursing babies.",

These include passive immunotherapy, based on the adoptive transfer of ex-vivo activated immune cells, immunomodulators (including cytokines) or tumour specific antibodies; and active immunotherapy, aimed at activating the patient's own immune system via the administration of a therapeutic vaccine. To date, active cancer immunotherapy trials have included therapeutic vaccination with recombinant viral vectors encoding TAAs, recombinant proteins with appropriate adjuvants, antigen-loaded Dendritic Cells (DCs), DNA encoding tumour-associated antigens, heat shock proteins and synthetic peptides (see next paragraphs). However, apart from melanoma, in which impressive clinical responses have been observed in a small proportion of patients, the recent success of Sipuleucel-T (see paragraph 3.1.2.1) and the promise of PROSTVAC-VF (see paragraph 3.2.1), most results have been disappointing. Therefore, the continuous development of novel vaccine strategies and technologies is needed to improve recognition, immune response, effector functions, and trafficking of T cells induced by vaccination. These goals may be achieved by the concurrent administration of novel immunotherapeutics with an immunopotentiating profile (see section 4.3).",

            "text": "Immune complex, as a form of autoimmune disorder and a tool in clinical therapy, has been an important topic of modern immunology. Binding of antigen by antibody, an immunologically simple event, changes properties of the original ligand, resulting in modulated antigen processing, presentation, receptor signaling, and inflammatory responses. On a larger scheme, antibody immune therapy has become one of the successfully implemented biomedical technologies in modern health care. Immunoglobulin-based new drugs such as rituximab, ipilimumab, and alemtuzumab are among the highly effective in cancer treatments (Sondak et al, 2011;Scott et al, 2012). Intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG, is also a choice treatment of autoimmunity, pediatric infections, and antibody deficiencies (Schwab & Nimmerjahn, 2013). In contrast, use of classically defined IC represents an old subcategory among the list of options. ICs in vaccine development and clinical interventions are becoming increasingly sophisticated, largely attributable to the newly gained understanding of Fcc receptors (FccR; Nimmerjahn & Ravetch, 2008;Ravetch, 2010). However, IC-mediated functions are not solely controlled via those receptor engagements. For instance, its ability to transport antigen is also a consideration of anatomic location; its roles at different stages of immune induction and memory formation are modulated by additional spatiotemporal factors. \n\nOver 100 years ago, IC vaccines were started as a practice of using antisera complexed to toxoids of Corynebacteria diphtheria or Streptococcus pyogenes to decrease the side effects in human vaccination (Copeman et al, 1922;Olitzki, 1935). One concern of this approach was that antigens coated with antibodies might have reduced exposure of surface sites, leading to limited antibody production. This concern was proven unnecessary by subsequent experiments (Olitzki, 1935).",

Nonetheless, annual influenza vaccination, which elicits antibodies mainly against the head region of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), remains as the mainstay to combat and reduce symptoms of influenza infection. Influenza HA is highly antigenically variable, thus limiting vaccine efficacy. In addition, the variable HA head occupies the upper strata of the immunodominance hierarchy, thereby clouding the antibody response toward subdominant epitopes, which are usually conserved across different influenza strains. Isolation of monoclonal antibodies from individuals recognizing such epitopes has facilitated the development of recombinant vaccines that focus the adaptive immune response toward conserved, protective targets. Here, we review some significant leaps in recombinant vaccine development, which could possibly help to overcome B cell and antibody immunodominance and provide heterosubtypic immunity to influenza A virus.",

            "text": "New strategies are needed to master infectious diseases. The so-called \u201cpassive vaccination\u201d, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe\u2019s life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.",

            "text": "To combat OPV infections, particularly those caused by MPXV, the CDC recommends the use of low molecular weight compounds and vaccinia immune globulin VIG derived from the pooled blood of vaccinated individuals [79]. These treatments were developed as emergency measures for severe infection. VIG has proven effective in mitigating side effects in adult vaccine recipients and, to a limited extent, in treating severe disease in children and immunocompromised patients [80]. However, the efficacy of VIG against other pathogenic OPVs remains unverified through direct studies, and its use is limited by inherent challenges associated with administering large protein quantities and standardization [81]. Additionally, the inability to rapidly procure sufficient doses limits the widespread application of VIG [68,82,83]. \n\nAn alternative to VIG that avoids these drawbacks is the use of mAbs preparations, which have shown significant growth in the global pharmaceutical market over the past decade. Public health authorities have recognized mAbs as a potential treatment for infectious diseases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Advances in mAb technology facilitate the enhancement of antibodies for specific applications, including the development of various recombinant antibody formats, antibody-drug conjugates, and the optimization of affinity, pharmacokinetics, and other pharmacological parameters [84]. \n\nSeveral mAbs (Table 1) demonstrated a high level of protection in model animals against lethal OPV infection. In most cases, an intramuscular dose of 45 to 100 \u00b5g of antibody was sufficient to achieve a protective effect, whereas VIG requires doses ranging from 1.25 mg to 5 mg-equivalent to 6000 IgG units/kg when administered to humans [85]. This suggests that therapies for OPV infections in humans may follow a similar pattern. \n\nIt is important to note that complete protection for the animals was not always achieved with mAbs, particularly in cases involving complicating factors such as immunodeficiency [86][87][88][89][90][91][92]. Employing combinations of different antibodies targeting one or more antigens can lead to enhanced protective outcomes.",

Although licensure criteria are based, in part, on achievement of Immune correlates of protection against influenza \u00aa 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, 5, 288-295 seroprotective HI titers \u202140, the suitability of this threshold titer to correlate with at least 50% protection against influenza at the population level, is dependent on age, as well as virus strain, subtype, or type. Development of improved inactivated vaccines that elicit broader and more durable responses to HA, and \u2044 or immune responses to other viral proteins is the focus of current research. Higher doses of HA in inactivated vaccines improve the proportion of responders and geometric mean titres among older adults (>65 years), and such vaccines are now licensed for older adults in the US. 11 Other strategies include targeting the generally conserved M2e protein either alone or in combination with other conserved viral targets NP or M1 proteins. 12 Combination vaccines that target HA and one or more viral proteins including NA are in clinical development, using a variety of delivery strategies (DNA, protein or viral vector based) and a number of different adjuvant strategies. The challenges for the successful licensure of such novel vaccines include a lack of knowledge on immune mediators of protection in humans, the lack of standardized assays that measure non anti-HA based immune responses, and the lack of reagents and procedures that can be used to measure vaccine potency for standardization of novel target vaccines. There is a need for low-cost, rapid-response technologies to address the gap in global vaccine supply and demand and to respond quickly to a pandemic. Many innovative technologies are in development, but significant hurdles are yet to be overcome including demonstration of safety, immunogenicity, scalability and regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory agencies are also facing hurdles in licensing non-HA based vaccines or vaccines produced by non-traditional manufacturing processes such as DNA vaccines, or recombinant proteins made in bacteria, insect cells or plants, including virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. The safety aspects regarding adventitious agents and unexpected immunological vaccine responses were discussed in relation to autoimmune reactions and co-expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules.",

            "text": "While the neutralizing antibodies elicited by a vaccine can be highly effective, purified neutralizing antibodies administered passively to acutely infected individuals can be equally efficient. Passive antibody therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis against several important human pathogens including hepatitis B, varicella, RSV and rabies virus. With the advancement of mouse-human chimeric mAbs and the capability to 'humanize' murine mAbs, passive antibody therapy has become even more efficient. One such example includes a 'humanized' mAb to RSV F protein (Syna-gis\u00ae/Palivizumab), a more cost-effective and highly sucessful treatment compared to the original polyclonal product [71]. Passive therapy for NiV was first demonstrated using polyclonal hyper immune serum in hamsters [62]. Here, hamsters were administered anti-NiV F or anti-NiV G polyclonal sera prior to challenge and all animals survived subsequent NiV challenge. In more recent studies, murine mAbs directed against NiV F or G were evaluated in lethal NiV challenge experiments in hamsters [72]. When mAbs were administered prior to and shortly after challenge all animals were protected. However, when administered 24 hours postchallenge, only 50% of the animals survived. Together these data demonstrate that passive transfer is possible for NiV. Importantly, to be further developed as a post-exposure therapy for human use, efficacy of this treatment needs to be increased beyond a 24 hour window, and murine mAbs may need to be converted to more humanized molecules. \n\nA major advancement in antibody technology has been the development of the phage display platform of combinatorial antibody libraries [73] as well as domain and chain shuffling methodologies to generate antibodies with new functional properties [74]. Phage libraries encode antibodies in the form of single-chain variable region fragments (scFvs) or Fab' fragments. Human phage display platforms are the most extensively used and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to obtain high affinity reagents (reviewed [75]).",

            "text": "Vaccinia virus has been long known to us since its use as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox. The advancement of genetic and immunologic research not only improved the safety profile of VACV as a smallpox vaccine but also as a recombinant vector [204]. A multitude of approaches to finely controlling viral replication by introducing inducible systems or complementing cell lines yielded exciting results in animal studies. Innovative methods to accelerate the generation of recombinant VACVs considerably reduced the turnover time to obtain and test a desired phenotype. Deepening the understanding of viral gene functions offered the opportunity to bring vector modification to the next level for a more immunogenic and protective vaccine or therapeutic vector. The participation of multidisciplinary efforts enabled the rational design of new VACV vectors with easily accessible data support, the exposure and monitoring of previously hidden replication events using novel labeling and imaging techniques, and the cost-efficient manufacture and distribution of vaccines beyond the R&D stage. \n\nWe are at the dawn of explosive technological advancement and should welcome changes to traditional research practices as well. Artificial intelligence (AI) integrated platforms may well mark the beginning of a new era of literature review and data management. For example, ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI. Since its release in November 2022, billions of users have been amazed by its outstanding performance. It can handle computer coding work, consolidate information, write poems and songs, and take tests or exams. Limitations do exist, such as providing ostensible answers that are factually nonsensical. However, we cannot neglect the potential of incorporating AI into scientific research, including in the development of VACV-vectored vaccines. Imagine an AI-assisted or even AI-operated platform that collects all publications on VACV by exhaustion and categorizes them by topic or field. Critical findings and conclusions are grouped and cross-compared to return a pattern of research interests shared among researchers. Input from new studies, such as identification of gene functions, mapping of epitopes, elucidation of immune responses, inter alia, can be conveniently added in a user-friendly manner.",

Furthermore, rapid developments from studies on antibody structures and functions, from genetic engineering technology for mass production of proteins and from novel methods of applying therapeutic antibodies have further boosted interest. Studies of the immune mechanisms initiated in cells by Fc-FcR interactions, have resulted in perception of the immune regulatory roles of antigen-antibody immune complex (IC) as a double-edged sword being revisited and studied in more detail. Despite their potential for pathological effects, ICs have been explored as preventive in addition to therapeutic vaccines, first in poultry breeding, and later in human diseases. This review summarizes the background, the mechanistic studies on Fc-FcR functions, the translational research on Fc-FcR and the prospects of IC-based vaccines.",

Reproduced from reference [121]. Copyright (2022), with permission from John Wiley and Sons. \n\nDNA manipulation using recombinant DNA technology has been intimately associated with our understanding of microorganisms including the pathogens that cause many infectious diseases in humans [122]. The scaling-up of antigen production for subunit vaccines design can readily be achieved from techniques that enable us to read, copy and manipulate DNA sequences. \n\nA good example is the development of vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) as illustrated on Figure 4: three prophylactic HPV vaccines based on the recombinant DNA technology were approved and purified L1 protein self-assembled as HPV empty shells and induced production of specific neutralizing antibodies [123]. One should notice that not all antigens self-assemble to yield NPs in dispersion. In many cases the vaccine subunit design requires also adjuvant(s) and/or immunostimulator(s). The technique of DNA cloning signaled the birth of genetic engineering, which allowed the facile transfer of genes among different biological species [124]. Thereby, genes encoding important recombinant proteins such as insulin and growth hormone were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisae; hundreds of pharmaceuticals such as therapeutic proteins and antibodies, including the monoclonal ones, became available in the market produced by the biotechnology industry [125]. Recombinant DNA technology indeed represents a valuable tool also in vaccines development which contributed to the fast design of COVID-19 vaccines applied during the recent pandemics as discussed next. \n\nCationic NPs also played a fundamental role in the delivery of mRNA vaccines, as highlighted by their successful use in the COVID-19 vaccination [126,127].",

            "text": "These results are similar to those described by Moreira et al. [12] in cattle and by Otaka et al. [18] in buffaloes, who measured the longevity of the immune response of these animals immunized with bivalent recombinant vaccines against botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) C and D over 365 days. Those authors used the same concentrations adopted in the present study (100, 200, 400 \u00b5g) and demonstrated that the concentrations of 200 and 400 \u00b5g also induced higher mean and longer lasting antibody titers than other formulations, including the commercial vaccine. This reinforces the idea that the levels of neutralizing antibody titers and the longevity of the immune response are directly related to the protein concentration per dose used in a vaccine. \n\nIn this study, the group of animals vaccinated with RV1 did not reach the minimum mean antitoxin titers for CPA, CPB or ETX on any of the evaluated days using the serum neutralization technique. The RV2 vaccine containing 200\u00b5g was the lowest recombinant protein concentration capable of inducing 100% seroconversion in the animals against the three toxins at 56 days after vaccination. It showed results statistically similar to RV3 in regard to the mean antibody titers throughout most of the study. Freitas et al. [19] tested, in horses, bivalent vaccines against C. perfringens rCPA and rCPB, obtained by the same cloning and expression technique used in the present study, at concentrations of 100, 200 and 400 \u00b5g per dose. At 56 days after immunization, the authors also found 200 \u00b5g as the lowest concentration capable of inducing the minimum antibody titers required by law against these toxins, demonstrating that the recombinant formulations produced using this technology show similar performance even in different species. These results indicate that the 100\u00b5g formulation may contain an inadequate concentration of antigens that can stimulate a satisfactory and lasting immune response against these toxins. However, they also indicate that 200 \u00b5g would be the minimum ideal concentration of recombinant proteins to induce an international law-compliant humoral immune response.",

            "text": "A renewed interest in the effects of unconjugated antibodies in cancer began in the early 1980s, after murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) became available. 38 These initial trials were performed in hematological malignancies, as well as in colorectal cancer and melanoma. 4 -6,39 -41 As with many inno-vative treatment approaches that are sometimes introduced before the technology has matured sufficiently to extract maximum benefit, only occasional clinical responses were observed. With insufficient efficacy and the immunogenicity of the foreign murine MAb, most of these studies were terminated. Fortunately, some investigators persevered. An excellent lesson on the tribulations of the development of an antibody product between an academic group and industry is that of alemtuzumab (Campath, Berlex, and Genzyme). 42 Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) had one of the earliest and protracted developments of an antibody ultimately commercialized. It took over 20 years from the development of the first rat immunoglobulin against CD52, changing the immunoglobulin type, and finally developing a humanized, recombinant form, and involved several commercial firms during this time. Chemotherapy-refractive chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the indication finally approved in 2001. \n\n4][45] Chimeric antibodies essentially splice V L and V H regions on the murine antibody to the human IgG, making a molecule that is 75% human and 25% murine IgG, whereas a humanized antibody grafts the CDR regions from a murine MAb, along with some of the surrounding \"framework\" regions to maintain CDR conformation, onto a human IgG, essentially making a molecule with 5% of its sequence from the parental MAb (Figure 1). 45 More recent advances have made available, either by genetic or phage-display methods, the development of fully human MAbs that have now entered clinical trials. 46 Such engineered MAbs are postulated to greatly reduce the immunogenicity of antibodies, allowing multiple injections to be given, and the human Fc enhances the interaction with other immune system elements. \n\nRituximab is perhaps the most prominent example of a highly successful paradigm of antibody therapy.",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA technology has made important contributions to both human and animal health, especially in the field of vaccinology. This vaccine strategy involves the injection of plasmid DNA encoding an antigen into host cells, where it can undergo translation, activating the CD4+ and CD8+ cells for an enhanced antigen-specific antibody and CTL response. Like the recombinant-vector vaccine, this vaccine technology is advantaged compared to the inactivated-virus and subunit systems, because it allows for the de novo synthesis of the immunogen, over a period of time, within the host cell following the injection of the DNA plasmid. This allows for the antigen presentation in its most native conformation [161,162] and the appropriate expression of both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules [163,164] similar to that in natural virus infection but devoid of risk of reversal to virulence, as with a live virus [165]. The DNA technology facilitates rapid updating by site-directed mutagenesis, which is particularly relevant for influenza vaccines. Messenger RNA-based vaccines work on the same principle and, as this technology has advanced for human applications, including their recent use to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it may soon come into veterinary applications. \n\nThe application of DNA technology to EI vaccines has been ongoing experimentally for some time, and it is gradually gaining acceptance as a possible basis for new generation vaccines in horses. In a study by Ault and colleagues, the ability of a recombinant DNA vaccine expressing HA antigen(s) from EIV H3N8 strains, either in a monovalent or multivalent composition, was assessed for its ability to induce protective immune responses against homologous EIV challenge in vaccinated ponies.",

            "text": "Subunit vaccines contain specific microbial components, such as proteins or surface antigens, that can induce neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant protein subunit vaccines avoid potential issues with purified macromolecule subunit vaccines, including co-purification of undesired contaminants or reversal of toxoids to toxigenic forms and interference between multivalent formulation components [141][142][143]. Thus, recombinant DNA technology has been proposed for expressing orthohantavirus proteins for hantavirus subunit vaccine development [144,145]. Recombinant DOBV nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) in mice induced a strong NP-specific IgG response and mixed Th1/Th2cell involvement [146]. DOBV rNPs conjugated with recombinant rP40 (the Klebsiella pneumoniae outer membrane protein A) showed higher NP-specific antibody responses. Immunogenicity of PUUV rNP-rP40 was characterized [147]. Recombinant PUUV proteins were expressed in E. coli 200. The truncated construct, P40-Puu118, gave high antibody titers after two doses and 100% protection after three doses, suggesting potential as a subunit vaccine against PUUV [148]. \n\nRecent years have witnessed significant advancements in both immune protection technology and bioinformatics, particularly high-throughput sequencing technology, accelerating the development of multi-epitope subunit vaccines through the reverse-vaccinology approach. In 2022, Ismail screened 340 epitopes from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), identifying 10 epitopes for potential inclusion in a potent multiantigenic epitope subunit vaccine. These epitopes were linked through specific GPGPG linkers to create a computationally designed vaccine [149]. This vaccine was then computationally combined with three different adjuvants to stimulate immune responses. A major limitation of that study is the lack of experimental validation.",

            "text": "In an earlier assessment of Operation Warp Speed, Moore and Klasse noted that while recombinant proteins are \"by far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses\", they were not included in the first wave of vaccine candidates [167]. DNA and mRNA vaccines inactivated viruses, as well as vector-based strategies, were able to attract more attention (and funding). Early on, these platforms offered a faster time to the clinic and the ability to produce the necessary quantities of vaccine. In the meantime, of course, a recombinant protein antigen-based vaccine has been added to the governmentsupported OWS portfolio and initial data from human clinical trials has begun to enter the public domain, and the first vaccines will have been administered by mid-December 2020. How these firstgeneration vaccines will perform in the long-term, and whether some of these new vaccine technologies will be received well by an increasingly vaccine-hesitant public remains to be seen [168].\n\nWhile arguably requiring more time for development and production, recombinant protein vaccines do offer distinct advantages over the mRNA and viral-vector vaccines [169]. First and foremost, they have a history of triggering a safe and robust immune response. Second, they are much less demanding when it comes to production, storage, and transportation. This is of paramount importance for transferring this proven vaccine technology to low-and middle-income countries. There, facilities to reproduce the new production platforms (e.g. mRNA vaccines) are unavailable [103], and establishing the infrastructure to distribute fastidious nucleic acid vaccines, with storage and transportation required at -94\u00b0F [170], is out of reach. Third, while viral-vector vaccines have been clinically successful as evidenced by, for example, the recent rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine against Ebola [171], concerns remain about how exposure to the viral vector backbone could impact the robustness of the immune response [172], or may even impose limitations on the ability to use the same viral vector platform for any possible booster vaccinations [173]. A recombinant protein vaccine does not carry that risk and may even be an ideal complement to elicit a more desired and prolonged immune response in a prime-boost approach.\n\nData from the first clinical studies with protein vaccine frontrunners",

Most crystal and solution structures of allergens have been obtained using recombinant allergens. Structural information on allergens allows insights into their evolutionary biology, illustrates clinically observed cross-reactivities, and makes the design of hypoallergenic derivatives for allergy vaccines possible. Recombinant allergens are widely used in molecule-based allergy diagnosis such as protein microarrays or suspension arrays. Recombinant technologies have been used to produce well-characterized, noncontaminated vaccine components with known biological activities including a variety of allergen derivatives with reduced IgE reactivity. Such recombinant hypoallergens as well as wild-type recombinant allergens have been used successfully in several immunotherapy trials for more than a decade to treat birch and grass pollen allergy. As a more recent application, the development of antibody repertoires directed against conformational epitopes during immunotherapy has been monitored by recombinant allergen chimeras. Although much progress has been made, the number and quality of recombinant allergens will undoubtedly increase and keep improving our knowledge in basic scientific investigations, diagnosis, and therapy of human allergic diseases.",

Methods Here, we compared the effects of glycosylation of YghJ, an Escherichia coli protein important for mucus attachment of bacteria causing in urinary tract infections (UTIs). A novel method based on statistical evaluation of phage display for the identification and comparison of epitopes and mimotopes of anti-YghJ antibodies in the sera was used. This is the first time that the effect of glycosylation of a recombinant bacterial antigen has been studied at the peptide epitope level. Results The study identifies differences in the immune response for (non)-glycosylated antigens in rabbits and pigs and compares them to a large group of patients with UTI, which have been diagnosed as positive for various bacterial pathogens. We identified glycosylation-specific peptide epitopes, a large immunological similarity between different UTI pathogens, and a broad peptide epitope pattern in patients and animals, which could result in a variable response in patients upon vaccination. Discussion This epitope analysis indicates that the vaccination of rabbits and pigs raises antibodies that translate well into the human immune system. This study underlines the importance of glycosylation in bacterial vaccines and provides detailed immune diagnostic methods to understand individual immune responses to vaccines.",

            "text": "The relative success of monoclonal antibodies in cancer immunotherapy and the vast manipulation potential of recombinant antibody technology have encouraged the development of novel antibody-based antitumor proteins. Many insightful reagents have been produced, mainly guided by studies on the mechanisms of action associated with complete and durable remissions, results from experimental animal models, and our current knowledge of the human immune system. Strikingly, only a small percent of these new reagents has demonstrated clinical value. Tumor burden, immune evasion, physiological resemblance, and cell plasticity are among the challenges that cancer therapy faces, and a number of antibody-based proteins are already available to deal with many of them. Some of these novel reagents have been shown to specifically increase apoptosis/cell death of tumor cells, recruit and activate immune effectors, and reveal synergistic effects not previously envisioned. In this review, we look into different approaches that have been followed during the past few years to produce these biologics and analyze their relative success, mainly in terms of their clinical performance. The use of antibody-based antitumor proteins, in combination with standard or novel therapies, is showing significant improvements in objective responses, suggesting that these reagents will become important components of the antineoplastic protocols of the future.",

Integration of the expression cassettes into the BHV-1 genome resulted in replacement or inactivation of pathogenicity-associated genes like the thymidine kinase gene [88][89][90][91][92] or genes encoding glycoproteins gC [92], gG [92,93], gE [86], or gI [85,87]. Analyses of the immunogenic properties of the BHV-1 recombinants expressing PRV glycoproteins in mice revealed induction of a protective immune response against a lethal challenge with PRV. Thus, these recombinants might be beneficial in situations where maternal antibodies interfere with immunization of piglets with PRV-based vaccines [91,92]. Recombinant herpesviruses expressing C. parvum p23 and BVDV E2 were inocculated into rabbits [93] or guinea pigs [89] and a specific antibody response against the appropriate pathogens was induced. To our knowledge, the only vaccination/challenge experiment in cattle was reported for the BRSV attachment protein G expressing BHV-1 vector which demon-strated that vaccinated calves were resistant to BRSV infection. However, in comparison to the control infection, virulence of the BRSV G expressing recombinant for calves was increased [86]. The suitability of canine herpesvirus as a vector for immunization purposes was evaluated using recombinants expressing the rabies virus G protein [94] or the Neospora caninum surface protein NcSRS2 [95]. Both vaccine candidates elicited specific antibodies against the respective target antigens. Vaccination/challenge experiments, however, await publication. Two studies reported vaccination against feline leukemia virus (FLV) using recombinant feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1). Efficient vaccination was achieved by im",

            "text": "The T4 phage display system has numerous applications, including vaccine development. Assembling massively multimeric copies of rare, expensive, unstable or enzymatic activities onto a T4 macromolecular platform can lead to generation of biopharmaceutical reagents and drugs. Protein secretion-related toxicity can be avoided by the T4 phage lytic process, and protein folding takes place in a fundamental intracellular environment to prevent the secretion of fusion protein. One of the most valuable and attractive features of the T4 phage display system over other phages is the ability to express large proteins (>700 amino acids) in an ordered array on the T4 phage surface. \n\nHowever, this system is also associated with several limitations. For one, the fused target protein displayed copy number decreases as the insert becomes longer. Ren et al showed that the target protein copy number was inversely proportional to the exogenous insert's length [21] . Second, it is not known whether in large animals and humans a recombinant T4 phage particle carrying a large fragment with biological activity would lose its insert from the capsid surface. Third, in the case of T4-recombinant phage used in domestic animals and humans, it is unclear whether the T4 phage particle would evade and overcome the reticuloendothelial system and intestine-liver barrier to enter the target organs or circulatory system. These questions need to be investigated in small animal models. The method of administration (oral versus injection) also merits further study. \n\nIn this study, we tested whether the self mFlt4 based on a T4 phage recombinant vaccine was able to stimulate self immune responses and induce specific antibodies. Previous studies suggested that immunity of angiogenic vessels was difficult to acquire by a vaccine based on autologous or syngeneic molecules due to immune tolerance acquired during early development of the immune system and that only a xenogeneic protein could provoke the immune response. However, more current studies demonstrated the feasibility of circumventing tolerance of self proteins.",

Allergens on VLPs may suppress allergic immune responses, while avoiding side-effects from direct activation of mast cells (40). New therapeutic antibodies continue to achieve clinical success, including landmark results of checkpoint inhibitors against cancer (119). Rather than recombinantly expressing antibodies and then infusing, there may be advantages in inducing people to generate their own blocking antibodies (75,80). Particulate vaccines presented here may be employed for noninfectious chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or hypertension (120). With plummeting costs of DNA sequencing, personalized mutation-specific cancer therapy will advance rapidly (121), providing further drive for rapid assembly of personalized cancer vaccines (Figure 4). \n\nIn all fields of science, progress can come faster when one can move from patient crafting of success to a reproducible assembly line (122)(123)(124)(125)(126). Vaccines must satisfy many criteria, including efficacy, safety, manufacturability, and cost-effectiveness, so vaccinology will never be easy. But the gains in pathogen genomics (31) and structural vaccinology (17) can be complemented by the automation of antigen multimerization, as modular VLP decoration becomes routine.",

            "text": "Consequently, screening antibodies from a human library is deemed the most effective approach for developing clinically applicable antibodies [17]. \n\nAmong various antibody libraries, such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, na\u00efve, immune libraries, and predefined CDR libraries tailored to specific requirements, the immune library offers a distinct advantage due to its repertoire specifically elicited against the target antigen [17][18][19][20][21]. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation and repeated exposure via immunization or natural infection enhances the specificity and efficacy of the antibodies. Antibodies sourced from immune libraries exhibit superior binding affinities scFv, first developed by Bird et al. in 1988 [9], is a recombinant polypeptide where V H is joined to V L via a flexible linker composed of glycine and serine amino acids [10]. With a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa, scFvs are much smaller than conventional whole Ig-based monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa), enabling more effective tissue penetration and access to epitope crevices, while retaining high antigen-binding affinity [11]. Their rapid systemic clearance has led to widespread use in therapeutic and imaging applications in clinical settings. Furthermore, the lack of an Fc region diminishes the immunogenicity of scFvs, broadening their therapeutic application scope. Additionally, their cost-effective bacterial production enhances the accessibility of scFvs as antibody-based therapeutics [10]. Due to these benefits, scFvs are increasingly utilized in clinical scenarios where conventional Ig and Fab are suboptimal, such as in Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy [12]. \n\nThe discovery of antibodies involves genetic manipulation of recombinant antibody fragments. Historically, antibody development was revolutionized by hybridoma technology, established by K\u00f6hler and Milstein in 1975, enabling large-scale production of specific antibodies [13]. Nevertheless, this technique has limitations. For instance, most mAbs produced via hybridoma technology are of murine origin and may induce human antimouse antibody responses in clinical settings [14].",

Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing.

In brief, Nb libraries were generated by using peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from a llama that was immunized 6 consecutive times with 100 \u00b5g recombinant Q586B2 (purification performed by the VIB Protein Core (VIB, Belgium)) in presence of the same volume of Gerbu adjuvant. The Nb phage library was constructed after total RNA extraction and cDNA subcloning into the phagemid vector pMECS. As soon as enrichment was observed on recombinant Q586B2 (10 \u03bcg/ml), individual colonies were selected and transformed into chemo-competent E. coli WK6 cells to allow large-scale purification. Eight distinct Nbs belonging to 8 different families based on the difference in their CDR3 regions could be retrieved and the Nb sequences are shown in Fig. S4a(i). Expression and purification of Nbs (encoding a C-terminal HA-and His 6 -tag) was similar as described earlier 53 . Briefly, following periplasmic extraction, Nbs were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a His-Trap column (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and eluted with 0.5 M imidazole (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (pH 7.5). The eluate was subsequently purified on a Superdex 75 (10/300) gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS using an Akta Explorer 10S (GE Healthcare using Unicorn 5.1 software). Next, the purity of the Nbs was evaluated via 12% Bis/Tris SDS-PAGE analysis, and the protein concentration determined via Nanodrop (Nanodrop ND-1000, Isogen, Hackensack, NJ, USA). All Nbs were treated with ProSep-Remtox beads (Immu-noSource, Schilde, Belgium) and confirmed to be LPS-free by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Kinetic-QCL Kit (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.",

There are many effective avenues for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins; however, the main challenge lies in achieving cost-effective production on a large scale. Over the past five years the potential for using plants as bioreactors has become well established. Plant systems offer several advantages: they are economical, using low-cost inputs such as light, water and miner-als; they are easily adaptable to large-scale operations (by growing more plants); they possess minimal risk of contamination with potential human pathogens; the products may not require purification and pharmaceuticals produced this way can be given mucosally, hence simplifying delivery and decreasing overall cost.\n\nPlant-derived pharmaceuticals can be categorized into three areas: antibodies, biopharmaceuticals, and vaccines. Plant-derived antibodies, also referred to as plantibodies, have extensive uses in many areas including bioremediation, disease resistance in plants and industrial purification processes. The most advanced application of plantibodies, however, is the production of antibodies for medical use. Stoger and colleagues [1] provided a recent review on plant-derived antibodies.\n\nThere have been many reports of biopharmaceutical expression in plants and these proteins have a diverse range of applications [2-9] (see Table 1). In general, however, expression levels of these plant-derived biopharmaceuticals need to be increased before commercial production can be accomplished [10].\n\nIn the past 12 years, substantial research has shown that plant-derived vaccines are feasible commodities. Walmsley and Arntzen give a general description of this technology and its early development [11]. This review highlights the advances made in the past three years and the future directions for the development of plantderived vaccines.",

            "text": "Immuno-epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies revealed that anti-PfMSP3 antibodies correlated with protective immunity [27][28][29]. \n\nWe have described earlier the development of a fusion protein, PfMSPFu24, comprising conserved regions of PfMSP-3 and PfMSP-1. The 19kDa region of PfMSP-1 (PfMSP-1 19 ) was fused to the 11kDa region of PfMSP-3 (PfMSP-3 11 ), that contains both T-helper (Th) epitopes and B cell epitopes that are targets of antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) [30,31]. Our studies with the recombinant histidine-tagged MSPFu24 have shown that both protein fragments PfMSP-1 19 and MSP-3 11 retained their characteristic structure and antigenicity, and the immunization with the fusion protein elicited both invasion inhibitory antibodies and antibodies that inhibited parasite growth through ADCI activity]. Thus, the initial pre-clinical studies incorporating both target proteins in one construct appeared promising, with significant potential for further translational development. \n\nDespite the advantages, recombinant subunit vaccines are weak immunogens, induce a poor immune response by themselves [32,33] and hence require an adjuvant and/or delivery system to improve immunogenicity [34][35][36][37]. The advantage of formulating a recombinant vaccine with an adjuvant is that it can reduce the amount of antigen in each dose and the number of vaccination doses. \n\nCurrently, aluminum salts (alum, Alhydrogel), MF59, ASOs and GLA-SE are a few vaccine adjuvants approved for human use [32,38]. There is much interest in the development of a safe and efficient vaccine delivery system, and nanotechnology has been widely applied to formulate a nanosized vaccine delivery platform that can promote immune responses [39,40].",

            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza represents a severe public health threat. Over the last decade, the demand for highly efficacious vaccines against avian influenza viruses has grown, especially after the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in China that resulted in over 600 human cases with over 200 deaths. Currently, there are several H5N1 and H7N9 influenza vaccines in clinical trials, all of which employ traditional oil-in-water adjuvants due to the poor immunogenicity of avian influenza virus antigens. In this study, we developed potent recombinant avian influenza vaccine candidates using HyperAcute\u2122 Technology, which takes advantage of naturally-acquired anti-\u03b1Gal immunity in humans. We successfully generated \u03b1Gal-positive recombinant protein and virus-like particle vaccine candidates of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza strains using either biological or our novel CarboLink chemical \u03b1Gal modification techniques. Strikingly, two doses of 100 ng \u03b1Gal-modified vaccine, with no traditional adjuvant, was able to induce a much stronger humoral response in \u03b1GT BALB/c knockout mice (the only experimental system readily available for testing \u03b1Gal in vivo) than unmodified vaccines even at 10-fold higher dose (1000 ng/dose). Our data strongly suggest that \u03b1Gal modification significantly enhances the humoral immunogenicity of the recombinant influenza vaccine candidates. Use of \u03b1Gal HyperAcute\u2122 technology allows significant dose-sparing while retaining desired immunogenicity. Our success in the development of highly potent H5N1 and H7N9 vaccine candidates demonstrated the potential of \u03b1Gal HyperAcute\u2122 technology for the development of vaccines against other infectious diseases.",

            "text": "A safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is urgently needed to control the worldwide HIV epidemic. However, the development of a vaccine against AIDS represents a substantial scientific challenge related to HIV antigenic variability, the lacking understanding of immune correlates for protection, limitations of available animal models, and the enormous constraints associated with the probable need for multiple large-scale clinical trials in different parts of the world (for review, see Excler et al., 2014). Moreover, the fragile immune system of HIV-infected individuals sets high standards to candidate vaccine safety. In the recent past, highly attenuated poxviruses continued to play a major role in the international search for an AIDS vaccine also taking advantage of established technologies for vector vaccine production at industrial scale. Different recombinant MVAexpressing HIV proteins have undergone preclinical and clinical testing for the activation of protective immune responses against AIDS often in combination with DNA-based and/or adenoviral vector vaccines (for review, see Iyer and Amara, 2014;Ondondo, 2014). Recombinant MVA vaccines targeting different HIV-1 subtypes continued to prove safe and immunogenic in additional clinical studies (Goepfert et al., 2014;Joachim et al., 2015;Munseri et al., 2015;Nilsson et al., 2015). Important new findings included data for the induction of high levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies and months durability of the vaccine-induced HIV Env-specific antibody responses. In this context, a necessary target antigen comprises the immunodeficiency virus envelope (Env) protein, as it could be shown to elicit antibody responses with enhanced protective capacity in nonhuman primate chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) or SIV challenge infection models (Barouch and Michael, 2014;Barouch and Picker, 2014;Roederer et al., 2014). Recent approaches are working on the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies at the mucosal site of viral entry based on Env-specific vaccines. Other important HIV immunogens delivered by MVA candidate vaccines include Gag, Pol, and Nef proteins targeting the induction of HIV-",

However, the main focus of this study is on co-immunization outcomes and not on immune responses to single-vaccine antigens. To our knowledge, only the TRAP protein has been tested in combination with CSP (as RTS,S and not full CSP, as done here). This is discussed extensively in the Discussion section, and we have noted it in the introduction. One recent co-immunization study has been reported (and is cited in our manuscript), but those vaccines had a vectored \"boost\" component and evaluated liver-stage antigens, whereas our study focuses on recombinant antigens expressed in sporozoites and on induction of antibodies, and there is no overlap between the antigens tested in that study and what we report here. The present study assesses co-immunization of recombinant protein pre-erythrocytic antigens with CSP to determine whether these antigens can enhance CSP-elicited protection. Thus, this study provides novel information that suggests that co-immunization of recombinant PE antigens may be one way to increase the protective efficacy of CSP-only vaccines.",

            "text": "For the case of monoclonal antibody products, our simulations revealed higher Profitability Index for recombinant DNA technology compared to IVT mRNA manufacturing. Although recombinant DNA monoclonal antibodies, due to their inferior potency profile, require higher dose i.e. approximately 10 times that of the IVT mRNA, we find that these elevated mass flow quantities are not reflected analogously on the final production cost. It is furthermore exhibited that IVT mRNA manufacturing demonstrates higher dependencies on raw materials leading to higher end product MSPD values. \n\nFor the study case of antigenic vaccines, recombinant DNA technology demonstrates higher economic performance requiring reduced capital resources, hence the utilisation of bacterial cell factories and the nature of the related downstream processes, ameliorate the use of costly raw material. Moreover, recombinant vaccine manufacturing encompasses proven, well-grounded protocols for both the upstream and downstream process development. Regarding the clinical field, this intervention does not rely on the human body to translate a pro drug to peptides or proteins, unlike the treatments based on IVT mRNA vaccines that stimulate the anticipated immune response only after translation is performed in vivo with all the related risks and pharmacokinetic variations. Whereas demand of supply is stable allowing for planned production, recombinant manufacturing appears advantageous hence it fulfills all the technical and financial expectations delivering proven track records of safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of clinical ambiguity. \n\nWhether large production capacities are required immediately such as in cases of global pandemic outbreaks, IVT mRNA significantly shortens the time required from development to clinical application and from benchtop to scale manufacturing, fostering rapid market penetration. In addition, when product flexibility is required to follow up viral mutations, IVT mRNA manufacturing, due to its synthetic processes and the reduced requirements for installation of large scale production equipment, offers unparalleled advantages. Clinical trials and actual field practice in the future will demonstrate whether mRNA technologies will manage to offer non-inferior therapeutic results compaired to their DNA recombinant established alternatives.",

            "text": "Pluribody technology is an innovative approach that utilizes genetically engineered plants to produce a diverse array of antibodies, referred to as pluribodies, that mimic those found in hyperimmunized camels. This technology leverages the natural defence mechanism of virus superinfection exclusion, resulting in diverse antibody-producing mosaics being produced consistently in plant leaves. The recombinant antivenom created through this process, using genetic data from immune cells in camels accurately mimics the toxinbinding properties of the immune response (Fig. 4). These properties resemble the venom-binding profile observed in equine antivenom [64]. Plant-based production systems offer distinct advantages, including ease of scalability, cost-efficiency, and an improved safety profile [43]. \n\nThrough a synthetic biological approach, pluribodies, the first plant-made recombinant polyclonal antibodies, were successfully created. Camels were immunized with venom fractions from Bothrops asper, resulting in the development of an immune VHH library. The pluribody-based formulation, derived from camels, exhibited the ability to neutralize toxin activities and provided effective protection to mice against lethal doses of venom [64]. Additionally, the study advocates for the utilization of plant cells to produce scFvBaP1, emphasizing its potential as a biotechnological alternative to horse immunization protocols for human therapy against snakebites [4,65]. \n\nPluribodies show a promising potential in vitro model but exhibit limitations in effectively neutralizing small toxins or complex venoms. Parreno et al. [64] suggested leveraging plant biofactories for the production of recombinant polyclonal antibodies. However, utilizing plants as expression systems for antibodies poses challenges such as restricted protein yields, non-human glycosylation patterns, and the necessity of extracting and purifying antibodies from the plant matrix, characterized by abundant cellulose, lignin, and other polymeric macromolecules. Addressing these challenges is essential to enhance and optimize the viability of plant-based antibody production [66].",

Sera collected pre-immune and after each immunization were assessed for IgG antibody titers specific for recombinant PfCyRPA by ELISA (Fig. 2a-h; Additional file 1: Table S1). Consistent with the results obtained from the mouse immunization experiment, all animals receiving GLA-LSQ, GLA-SE or GLA-Alum adjuvanted vaccine formulations had developed IgG antibodies that interacted with the PfCyRPA immunogen already after the first immunization. While a second immunization led to a titer increase in all immunized rabbits, booster effects after the third immunization were observed only in some animals receiving the GLA-LSQ and GLA-SE adjuvanted formulations. The IgG endpoint titers obtained after the third immunization were comparable between all adjuvanted groups. In the unadjuvanted immunization group, one animal sero-converted after the second and the other only after the third immunization. Only one rabbit had developed a marked antibody titer after the third immunization, which was much lower than that of the rabbits receiving adjuvanted formulations (128,000 Table 3 Humoral immune responses elicited in New Zealand rabbits by adjuvanted formulations of recombinant PfCyRPA Shown are ELISA IgG endpoint titers of individual serum samples collected after the third immunization and the concentration of purified total IgG that gives half-maximal binding in ELISA.

They are used in many standard assays such as immunoblot, flow cytometry, or immunohistochemistry. In addition this, the emerging field of proteome research has a huge need of binders against different protein antigens and splice variants (1,2). Moreover, recombinant antibodies are used for the diagnosis of different pathogens (3)(4)(5) or toxins (6,7). In the past decade, several antibodies for therapeutic applications have been developed (8,9), primarily targeting inflammatory or tumor diseases (10). In 2010, sales of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in the USA and EU reached 50 billion US dollars (11). \n\nFor the detection of different antigens, polyclonal antibodies are widely used in research and diagnostics. These sera contain a large and diverse amount of different antibodies with unknown specificities. However, polyclonal non-human antibodies may exhibit an immune response in human beings that hampers the therapeutic use for example after snake bites (12). Therefore, the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by hybridoma technology was a significant milestone (13) for the generation of antibodies for therapeutic use. As this technology is based on the fusion of antibody producing spleen cells from immunized mice or rats with immortal myeloma cell lines, its main obstacle is the inefficient immune response to highly toxic or conserved antigens. In addition, nearly all antibodies which are currently in clinical development are of human-origin or at least humanized in some aspect (9,14,15) to prevent immunogenicity. Consequently, Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin G; mAb, monoclonal antibody. transgenic animals, especially mice, have been developed which contain a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire (16,17) solving the problem of immunogenicity but not the need of an efficient immune response after immunization. Finally, in vitro selection technologies such as antibody phage display or ribosomal display provide a solution for the generation of human antibodies (18)(19)(20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "There is now growing evidence that Rituximab can affect other disease indications such as rheumatoid arthritis [27], immune related indications [28][29][30], and in transplantation [31]. \n\nDue to this widespread potential of CD20 targeting antibodies in disease indications, there are emerging Rituximab \"biosimilars\" for use in humans [32] such as Ibritumomab and Tositumomab [33][34][35]. Although the Rituximab and chemotherapy regime (R-CHOP) has a big impact on patient management, there are views towards ever improving anti-CD20 modalities. One solution to developing innovative immune therapies is the integration to sporadic canine Diffuse Large B-cell and Marginal Zone lymphomas that have a similar molecular fingerprint to the human counterpart [36,37]. Indeed, there is now reported an anti-CD20 mouse monoclonal antibody that can target canine CD20 [38] and biopharmaceutical licensing of the FDA's first canine-specific CD20 targeting monoclonal antibody [20]. Here we report on an approach to develop a recombinant version of a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that can target both canine and human CD20 protein and that can be cloned towards use as a biologics platform for recombinant anti-CD20 bioconjugates in comparative medicine. Although emerging trends in the pharmaceutical field are moving towards recombinant antibody based immunotherapies, there are a paucity of immunocompetent models existing with which to develop cutting-edge concepts using recombinant IgG. Key advantages of the recombinant scFV are (i) the ability to fully caninize the molecule or use synthetic constructs for repeat use in vivo through tolerance of the canine immune system and (ii) the development of ADCC based assays after fusion of the scFV to canine Fc constant chains.",

            "text": "Studying the molecular arms race that characterizes our constant fight against pathogens has revealed a powerful source of therapeutics using an obvious and widely available resource: our own immune response. In particular, it is the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)-highly specific, continuously generating antibodies derived from a single B cell clone that target only a single site (epitope) on a single antigenthat offers a lot of this potential. These are exciting times in monoclonal antibody research. The steady stream of technological advances is, if anything, accelerating in the 21 st century, knocking down obstacles in the process. New applications are wide ranging-from finding the Achilles heel of pathogens and elucidating autoimmune disease, to treating infections in patients. The latest round of developments allows us to hope that they may be used in the clinic to kill cancer cells and eradicate pathogens such as influenza. \n\nThe use of antibodies in research and therapeutics has come a long way since the crude serum transfer experiments of the 1800s, largely due to the advances in modern technologies capable of such feats as immortalizing human B cells, screening randomly paired human antibody genes, and producing human antibody in cell cultures. Such breakthroughs have highlighted the role that monoclonal antibodies may play in the future development of immune therapies and rational vaccine design for rapidly changing pathogens such as influenza and HIV. This article will explore the history and current state of monoclonal antibody technology and how it has contributed to therapeutics, both through direct clinical treatments and by providing valuable insights into hostpathogen interactions. Importantly, we will highlight how these technologies help identify factors that produce broadly neutralizing antibodies-antibodies that by virtue of binding to certain epitopes important in the viral life cycle, are able to bind many disparate viral strains and prevent them from infecting their target cells. These antibodies are vital in effective therapeutics and, ultimately, successful vaccine design.",

            "text": "Thus, according to the observed results, the animals immunized with COMV would, in theory, remain unprotected for approximately 210 days, and those vaccinated with RV3 for 180 days, before the annual booster dose. This low longevity of the immune response was also observed by Moreira et al. [12] and Otaka et al. [18] with the use of recombinant proteins, as well as in the experiment by Augusto de Oliveira et al. [22] in which cattle immunized with commercial polyvalent clostridial vaccines showed measur-able neutralizing antibody titers only up to 60 days for ETX, 120 days for BoNT C and 180 days for BoNT D, according to the serum neutralization technique. These data indicate that the short duration of the humoral immune response is a reality observed in animals immunized with commercial toxoids or with recombinant vaccines, demonstrating the importance of planning new clostridial vaccination protocols and schedules and proposing adjustments to existing ones. The addition of more doses at smaller intervals, such as biannual revaccination or adjustments in the intervals between the first and second doses of the initial vaccination protocol, can be adopted as strategies to increase the detection period of neutralizing antibodies in sera from these animals. In addition, further studies are needed to find ways to prolong the humoral immune response induced by these recombinant vaccines, considering the efficacy results already achieved with this technology in different species [3,15,18,19] and given the limitations of conventional production. Tests involving other adjuvant molecules besides the aluminum hydroxide used in most commercial and recombinant vaccines can improve and prolong the efficacy of these vaccines [21,28] and bioinformatic tools can be used for the development of new immunogenic recombinant molecules. Rodrigues et al. [29] reported that with the aid of such tools, they designed new versions of the rCPB protein and produced an unpurified protein (rCPB-C) with high productivity, solubility and antigenicity, which is another promising option for the development of recombinant vaccines that induce a more lasting humoral immune response.",

            "text": "It was noted that biologically modified rH7 vaccine elicited a stronger antibody response than chemically-modified vaccine in this experiment. As expected, there was no anti-HA Ab response from the group that was not primed, regardless of whether the vaccines were \u03b1Gal positive or negative. In addition, hemagglutination inhibition titers further confirmed that pre-existing high anti-\u03b1Gal antibody levels were absolutely required for \u03b1Gal-modified vaccines to induce anti-HA antibodies (Fig 8C and 8D). \n\nThe striking difference in the antibody response between primed and un-primed mice confirmed that the immune-complex formed between the \u03b1Gal epitope on the \u03b1Gal-modified vaccine and anti-\u03b1Gal Ab facilitated the presentation of the vaccine antigen by APC [19], which consequently enhanced the immune responses against the target antigen. This experiment demonstrated the potential of \u03b1Gal HyperAcute\u2122 technology in the vaccine development for human, who naturally have high pre-existing anti-\u03b1Gal antibody level. \n\nIn addition to H7N9 recombinant HA vaccine candidates, we have also investigated VLP platform. As shown in Fig 9, both biologically and chemically modified \u03b1Gal (+) VLP vaccines elicited significant anti-HA antibody response when compared with un-modified control groups (Fig 9A). Interestingly, VLP vaccines that were chemically modified (only data of CAL-aN11 linker was shown) induced much higher anti-HA antibody levels and HI titers than biologically modified VLPs (Fig 9B and 9C). One possible reason is that our chemical modification technology modified all antigens on the VLP surface, including not only HA, but also NA, and any other existing surface antigens, such as glycolipids. The overall higher level of \u03b1Gal epitopes on chemically modified VLP surface may have led to a higher anti-HA response. Again, the significant difference between 50 ng/dose of \u03b1Gal-modified VLP (H7 VLP + CAL-aN11) and the 500 ng/dose of un-modified version (H7 VLP) indicated that the \u03b1Gal technology improved the potency of H7N9 VLP vaccine candidates at least 10-fold in mice.",

The term 'synthetic vaccinology' is applied when sequencing data alone are sufficient to rapidly initiate vaccine antigen design and the production of key reagents 33 (Fig. 2). Advances in atomic-level protein engineering 10,34,35 , understanding of the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) [36][37][38] and the identification of other self-assembling molecules that improve immunogenicity by optimizing antigen display [39][40][41] facilitate the fine tuning of vaccineinduced immune responses to specific antigenic targets. \n\nAccelerating the development and evaluation of vaccines will require new investments and international cooperation. Platform technologies that take advantage of delivery approaches with an established manufacturing process or that have a substantial pre-existing safety database in humans could shorten the timeline for manufacture by having uniform 'Chemical, Manufacturing, and Controls' sections for investigational new drug applications and by accelerating preclinical toxicology testing [42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] (Fig. 1). This is a major focus of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and the new concepts of the Biodefense Preparedness Organizations mentioned above, which indicates that the need is being recognized and an infrastructure for investment is being established. It is likely that multiple distinct platform vaccine technologies will be needed to address the diversity of viral pathogens and disease manifestations. In addition to the process of putting product in a vial, there is a need for improved communication and cooperation across borders to accelerate regulatory review of new products. Organizations like the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum should be expanded across the globe so that products can enter efficacy evaluation more rapidly in the midst of a crisis.",

Much of the work in this area has been based on protein subunit vaccines, an approach utilizing recombinant viral protein as a target immunogen. The primary roadblocks to HIV bnAb vaccine development include the role of tolerance mechanisms in limiting bnAb B cell precursor development, peripheral anergy and the requirement that bnAbs have very unusual traits to neutralize HIV [4,11]. Moreover, since HIV mutates rapidly and integrates into host genes [12], high levels of long-lasting antibodies against multiple bnAb Env epitopes must be present at the time of infection to prevent virus escape and provide sterilizing immunity [13]. Thus, the task for induction of protective bnAb-mediated immunity is to induce high titers of long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to multiple Env epitopes [13]. It has been suggested that adding a CD8 + T cell inducing immunogen or platform to a bnAb vaccine may lower the titers of bnAbs needed for protection [14].",

The morphological changes and accompanying physiological processes exhibited by this pathogen serve various purposes and offer promising avenues for drug investigation. Antibody-based medications targeting these proteins have exhibited positive therapeutic outcomes. In addition, antifungal antibodies present a diminished occurrence of adverse reactions and a broader array of choices when compared to small molecule drugs. Furthermore, the utilization of a synergistic combination of monoclonal antibodies and antifungal medications not only provides a more comprehensive and efficient approach to combat the escalating drug resistance observed in Candida species but also enhances specificity and holds potential for improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, the advancement of novel immunomodulatory techniques that integrate the regulation of recombinant cytokines with monoclonal antibodies presents an alternative strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the latter. Moreover, emerging technologies offer promising avenues for the treatment of lifethreatening invasive fungal infections. However, despite the encouraging potential for vaccine development and antifungal therapies, additional research is necessary comprehend their effectiveness and constraints comprehensively. It is crucial to explore approaches for establishing a persistent and uniform symbiotic model of candidiasis in mice, considering its symbiotic nature in humans. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of relevant vaccines and antibodies is paramount to appropriately administering them to eligible patients and maximizing their therapeutic benefits. Additionally, it is imperative to establish a timely and dependable method for evaluating the efficacy of vaccines and antibodies while also investigating the potential of antibodies as valuable biomarkers for diagnosing Candida infection. Moreover, the primary challenge lies in securing adequate funding for clinical trials of innovative antifungal medications, particularly for vaccinations targeting opportunistic fungal pathogens that exclusively affect individuals with severe immune system deficiencies. These vaccinations may not be as commercially appealing as those designed to combat diseases that affect a significant portion of the general population. Consequently, it is anticipated that collaborative efforts involving academia, industry, and the government will be imperative in facilitating the advancement of promising and novel antifungal immunotherapeutics into clinical trials and, subsequently, the market.",

            "text": "In common with previous studies [32], we predicted 29 B-cell linear epitopes in the amino sequence of CsPmy, high level of antibody production may result from multiple B cell epitopes of paramyosin. DNAbased vaccine technology is a promising new tool in the development of vaccines to efficiently stimulate humoral (antibody) and cellular (T cell) immune responses to protein antigens, immunogenic proteins are expressed in in vivo transfected cells in their native conformation with correct posttranslational modifications [33]. DNA-based vaccines have been shown to confer immunity against different infectious diseases including parasitic infections based on their potential in inducing cellular immune responses [8,34,35]. Here, we investigated the protective efficacy of recombinant pcDNA-CsPmy plasmid which carried the fulllength sequence of CsPmy. The strong immune responses elicited by pcDNA-CsPmy plasmid suggested that antigenic peptides of CsPmy were efficiently processed by antigen-presenting cells in vivo. As a sequence, both rats immunized with pET-26b-CsPmy protein and pcDNA-CsPmy plasmid exhibited strongly combined Th1/ Th2 immune responses, which could be reflected by increased level of IgG1 and IgG2a in serum. We also evaluated immune responses by measuring Th1/Th2-associated cytokines level including IFN-c and IL-4 (see Figure S2), which represented Th1 type and Th2 type immune responses [8,34,35]. Although increased level of IL-4 was lower than the level of IFN-c in both pET-26b-CsPmy group and pcDNA-CsPmy group treated with TWE or rPmy, elevated IL-4 secretion was apparently induced by CsPmy, indicating that CsPmy was capable to induce combined cellular and humoral immunity (see Figure S2). To be expected, long-lasting strong antibody production resulted in significant reduction rate of worm burden and EPG in our preliminary vaccination trials, showing the potential of CsPmy as a C. sinensis vaccine.",

            "text": "The targets for vaccine development for infectious diseases comprise mainly surface antigens of pathogenic viruses (Table 1) and other infectious agents (Table 2). Obvious targets for vaccine development have been antigens of influenza virus and HIV. In this context, recombinant SFV particles expressing influenza nucleoprotein (NP) have demonstrated strong immune responses [35]. Similarly, VEE-based expression of hemagglutinin (HA) elicited strong immune responses and even provided protection against challenges with H5N1 virus in chicken [36]. Likewise, expression of the swine influenza virus HA H3N2 gene from VEE vectors protected swine from influenza virus challenges [37]. In another study, the swine influenza HA gene was expressed from replication-deficient alphavirus particles showing no spread of vaccine or reversion to virulence in the intended host (pig) or non-host (mouse) species [38]. Specific humoral and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) responses were observed in pigs, which were also protected against influenza virus challenges. Recombinant MV vectors carrying the HA gene have also been applied for vaccination studies [39]. Also VSV vectors have been utilized for vaccine development against influenza virus [40]. Instead of using full-length HA, expression of the stalk domain of HA generated chimeric HA (cHA) antigens. Both intramuscular and intranasal immunization of mice resulted in HA stalk-specific, cross-reactive antibodies. Prime-boost vaccination provided protection against lethal challenges with both homologous and heterologous influenza strains, which was significantly superior with intranasal administration. For obvious reasons HIV has been a popular target for vaccine development. For instance, administration of Kunjin replicons expressing the HIV-1 gag antigen to BALB/c mice elicited gag-specific antibodies and protective gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses [41]. Interestingly, a single immunization with Kunjin virus particles induced 4.5-fold higher CD8+ T-cell responses and protection agains HIV challenges was obtained after two injections.",

            "text": "Vaccines represent one of the greatest contributions to public health [1]. An enormous effort is invested in the development of new technologies for vaccines against important human diseases, such as schistosomiasis [2].\n\nSubunit vaccine technologies such as, recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides, exploit immunogenic components of pathogens as antigens. However, many recombinant proteins are not sufficiently immunogenic to induce protective immunity and usually require potent adjuvants to ensure robust and long-lasting immune responses.\n\nApproaches with great potential to increase the immune responses are the new antigen presenting systems [1]. A recently developed strategy, multiple antigen-presenting system (MAPS), can incorporate recombinant proteins in fusion with rhizavidin into templates conjugated with biotin, generating a macromolecular complex. The integration of several antigen components, including polysaccharides and proteins in the same construct, has shown induction of a broad spectrum of immune responses, including specific antibodies, Th1 and Th17 responses [3]. The genetic fusion of the antigen to rhizavidin allows its affinity coupling to the biotinylated matrix [3].\n\nThe avidin-biotin interaction has been widely used as affinity probes and matrices for a wide variety of applications in biochemical assays, diagnostics, affinity purification, and drug administration [4]. In order to further expand the applications of the avidin-biotin technology, several developments have been investigated to link proteins or antigens to biotin-binding proteins [5][6][7]. Rhizavidin from Rhizobium etli is the first naturally occurring dimeric protein in the avidin protein family [8]. The novel rhizavidin-biotin-based MAPS has been studied in humans and found to be safe and immunogenic by Affinivax with ASP3772, its novel vaccine-targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03803202).\n\nThe development of Schistosoma vaccines has gone through several phases. Initially, using irradiated cercarial immunization, both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses can be observed and contribute to protection in given",

            "text": "Despite moderate-to-low efficacy, cumbersome manufacturing processes and long lead times for annual strain reformulation, the current production system of seasonal influenza vaccines has been relatively unchanged over the past 40 years. Advances across the fields of structural biology, influenza virology and immunity have set the stage for major advances towards improved seasonal and universal influenza vaccines. The influenza vaccine field's acceptance of these technological advances is only the first step towards worldwide practical implementation of next-generation vaccines. Meaningful and lasting advances in the influenza vaccine field are now achievable, but they depend upon leveraging expertise, communication and cooperation from stakeholders across many disciplines, from funding agencies to basic scientists, epidemiologists, regulators, manufacturers and the public.\n\nSeasonal influenza vaccine production remains an enormous challenge for manufacturers as the vaccines must be produced and released 6 months after the WHO announces the vaccine strains for the following season in a given hemisphere. Currently, there are three different production technologies approved for influenza vaccines: egg-based, cell-based and recombinant proteins. The majority of the licensed vaccines are made using embryonic chicken eggs, and even though this production system has remained unchanged for decades, it is still the only method that can meet the current annual need of seasonal influenza vaccine for the global population. Five hundred million doses are generated annually but could potentially produce 1.5 billion seasonal and 6.4 billion pandemic doses 214 . Vaccines produced from cell culture were first approved by the FDA in www.nature.com/nrd 2012 (reF. 215 ) and a synthetic HA vaccine was subsequently approved in 2013 (reF. 216 ). This recombinant protein-based approach allows a process that does not require virus propagation and can be run on a large scale once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. Together with the recent advances in high-cell density, perfusion continuous flow processing 217 , this approach opens the door to producing next-generation subunit protein vaccines and meeting the increasing demand for safe, affordable and effective influenza vaccines.\n\nPublished online 14 February 2020",

            "text": "cytokine co-expression. The solution to identifying such correlates lies in the application of a range of multi-plex technologies that all detect multiple analytes at the genetic, protein, and cellular level, so called \"systems vaccinology\" (49).\n\nWe are also moving into an era of high dependency on computational infrastructure as the data generated by such complex studies require specialized programmes for full analysis. Hence, collective approaches are becoming increasingly important if we are to maximize our potential to develop and adopt complex technologies in the future. The importance of genomic information and alternate expression systems such as Pichia pastoris, insect and mammalian cells has meant wider availability of species-specific immune proteins. The veterinary immunology community has a long history of working together for collective good, such as the HLDA workshops, international CD workshops, toolkit committees, collaborative funding initiatives and the immunological toolbox. In doing so we need to maintain a global perspective and consider technologies that create solutions for animal diseases across borders. One example is the antibody sequencing technologies of the new UK Immunological Toolbox. In addition to the advantages described earlier, this technology offers particular cost-effective and sustainability benefits for the transfer and storage of reagents to LMICs where veterinary immunology research is being conducted.\n\nIn parallel to sequencing, expressing and engineering mAbs, companies and research groups all over the world are adapting single B cell sequencing technologies to a range of host species. These technologies often rely to some extent on existing reagents to identify B cells (including antigen specific B cells) but are generally very adaptable to any given species and synergise well with existing mouse recombinant antibody expression methods. These methods are providing a completely new route to identifying antibodies against specific epitopes on pathogens as well as other foreign immunizing antigens. These antibodies can be used as reagents, including mapping complex epitope landscapes to inform structural vaccinology approaches to increase efficacy, and may also be used as therapeutics. Antibodies are now a primary therapeutic goal of many companies for a range of human diseases. Cats and dogs are not only a profitable target market for immunotherapeutics, they provide value data on in vivo mAb function (50). Although the cost of such treatments is currently prohibitive for food producing species,",

            "text": "The greatest challenges, for both human and animals, is to elicit a strong, balanced, and stable immune response at a very early age when infants and calves are at the greatest risk of being severely affected by RSV infection. Looking at current R&D activities and the resulting patent applications, three technologies stand out that are frequently applied for in all three fields: live attenuated, sub-unit antigen-based and nucleic-acid-based vaccines. The results clearly indicate that the veterinary field continues to rely on the technology of live attenuated vaccines, as a reliable and cost-effective method of vaccination. This is in line with the commonly shared idea that veterinary disease control must be cost-efficient [38]. Initially, immunization in humans with virus-inactivated vaccines resulted in enhanced disease progression after natural infection in vaccinated infants. This led to serious concerns about the safety and discontinuation of this vaccine technology for use in the human field. Recently, new attenuated strains have been generated for human use, but it proved difficult to select live candidates with the right combination of safety and immunogenicity. Only one new candidate strain revealed to be safe, moderately immunogenic, and genetically stable for infants and children, aged 6-24 months old [39]. \n\nThe prominent patent applications for the development of human subunit-vaccines are due to new insights into structural aspects of the viral proteins, allowing the design of a vaccine with a conformation close to their native viral form, leading to the development of several subunit vaccines [40]. For the veterinary field, recently two sub-unit vaccine candidates were found to be safe and effective for one-month-old calves with maternally derived serum antibodies [41], suggesting that the subunit-vaccine technology is promising for the development of vaccines in both fields. The development of vaccines using nucleic acid technology is found in all fields, with mRNA inventions only being used in the human field.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate the immunogenicity and protectiveness of a recombinant mouse x pig chimeric antibody fused with peptides of structural and nonstructural proteins of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) directed to DEC205+ cells. Priming and booster immunizations were performed three weeks apart and administered intradermally in the neck area. All pigs were challenged with PRRSV two weeks after the booster immunization. Immunogenicity was evaluated by assessing the presence of antibodies anti-PRRSV, the response of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ cells, and the proliferation of cells. Protection was determined by assessing the viral load in the blood, lungs, and tonsils using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the vaccine exhibited immunogenicity but conferred limited protection. The vaccine group had a lower viral load in the tonsils and a significantly higher production of antibodies anti-PRRSV than the control group (p < 0.05); the vaccine group also produced more CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ cells in response to peptides from the M and Nsp2 proteins. In conclusion, this antigenized recombinant mouse x pig chimeric antibody had immunogenic properties that could be enhanced to improve the level of protection and vaccine efficiency.",

            "text": "Vaccines play a key role in protecting humans from emerging infectious diseases. Currently, in the case of COVID-19, the continuous appearance of viral mutants since the first outbreak in 2019 and breakthrough infections after vaccinations are major issues. A broad range of novel or next-generation vaccine antigens, such as mRNA, DNA, and synthetic and recombinant components, are being developed and used instead of microbial-derived components. These types of components show clear advantages over conventional classical antigens from a manufacturing and process control standpoint. As novel antigens have successfully completed clinical trials and have been approved for human use, antigens tailored to emerging infectious diseases will continue to be widely proposed. Future vaccine research requires technology that can be applied immediately to clinical and preclinical experiments, with easy production when a viral disease emerges. Nanoengineering is being applied to overcome major issues associated with recombinant protein subunit, mRNA, and DNA vaccines that have potential for clinical application. These issues include poor immunogenicity and insufficient induction of inappropriate immune responses. Nanoparticulate vaccines are primarily being developed to safely deliver antigens to APCs and to maximize immune activity by protecting against proteolysis in the physiological environment. Nanoplatforms can be optimally engineered for various molecules and specific antigens by modulating the physicochemical properties of their components or by presenting multimeric forms conjugated or formulated with immune potentiators. Further, it is important to develop systems that use antigens and molecules encapsulated within NPs to deliver them to the desired location with appropriate timing; it is also important to ensure tightly controlled release kinetics. Consequently, nanoengineered vaccines have great potential to be a flexible platform and provide novel strategies for the development of the next generation of vaccines.",

            "text": "Therapeutic proteins played a pivotal role in combating numerous diseases over the recent decades. Subsequently, the landscape of recombinant products has expanded exponentially, encompassing a diverse array of biologics, including blood products, hormones, cytokines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [1]. With the advancement of genetic engineering technology, research in protein drugs achieved significant breakthroughs. The application of technologies such as fusion proteins, peptides and engineered antibodies diversified the construction of protein drugs, allowing for customization based on disease characteristics and patient needs [2]. Progress in protein expression systems has enabled the synthesis of virtually any desired protein or peptide [3]. Notably, this technological advancement has empowered the creation of unprecedented molecules that diverge from natural proteins, exemplified by fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies. These novel categories of therapeutic proteins exhibit unique functionalities that hold immense potential in enhancing drug efficacy. \n\nIn protein cell culture, there are impurities that can potentially trigger adverse reactions or allergic responses. \n\nImmune responses to these impurities can result in the loss of tolerance to their endogenous counterparts leading to serious adverse events [4]. The ICH Q6B guideline sets out the principles for consideration in setting product quality specifications (appearance, identity, purity and impurities, potency and quantity). Simultaneously, while navigating market price regulations and competition, pharmaceutical companies must address the vital challenges of costeffective production and achieving high product recovery rate to ensure sustainable profitability. \n\nExtracting high-purity target products from complex mixtures is an extremely challenging task. The diversity of protein structures has led to an increased complexity of product-and process-related impurities. Relying solely on lessons derived from mAbs has proven somewhat inadequate for the purification of complex recombinant proteins. For example, bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are an emerging class of biotherapeutics with design diversity, each with a unique combination of antigen-binding domains that bind two different antigenic epitopes [5]. The multi-target design allows the simultaneous introduction of BsAb-specific byproducts, such as mispaired products, undesired fragments and higher levels of aggregates.",

            "text": "These results underscore the potential role of FHA for IgA and IL-17a. Otherwise, relative contribution among the three antigen components (Figure 5) and the correlation between IgA and bacterial clearance of nasal tissues was not confirmed. \n\nThe recombinant aP antigens were refractory to soluble expression in E. coli). In the present study, soluble production of raP antigens was ensured by fusion to an RNAinteraction domain (in this case, WHEP domain [39]) to harness with the chaperna function exploiting a novel chaperone function of tRNAs [34,38]. During the course of the study, we noted, despite initial soluble expression, an aggregation tendency in particular for recombinant PT X during prolonged storage. This may be responsible for its low immunogenicity (Figure 3a). Therefore, the biophysical characteristics of these fusion proteins, e.g., solubility and aggregation behavior, need to be further monitored and improved to ensure long-term stability. \n\nCurrently licensed aP vaccines may have limitation to pertussis variations, and it is likely that recombinant vaccines could provide an option for rapid response to sporadic pertussis outbreak by genetic variants. For instance, vaccine-derived immunity may not protect against mutant pertussis strains, particularly against pertactin (prn)-deficient variants [16][17][18][19]. In the 1990s, pertussis epidemics returned to advanced nations despite high vaccination rates, such as the Netherlands, the United States, Japan, the UK, and Austria [72].

In addition, adjuvanted vaccine formulations may be specifically designed to polarize maternal responses to minimize interference with infant responses to subsequent vaccination or infection. Lastly, passive immunization (via the use of monoclonal Abs) may also be considered a relevant tool in areas where no vaccine currently exists. This includes the mAb Palivizumab (brand name Synagis), produced by recombinant DNA technology for the prevention of RSV infections, especially in at-risk preterm infants. 116 NCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Modern vaccine design and development strategies endeavor to integrate knowledge of formulation composition and understanding of immunostimulatory mechanisms to generate immune responses otherwise unachievable in relevant target populations. 98,117 Rational vaccine design approaches, employing novel immunoengineering strategies, and targeted delivery systems may allow for the controlled preparation of vaccine formulations of the desired immunostimulatory properties, particulate size, and antigen load, all of which can greatly improve safety and limit systemic toxicities due to their targeted nature. 118 These potential advances may be key to tailored vaccines capable of matching unique characteristics of the developing immune system during the neonatal period and infancy. 2 Plotkin 13 highlighted various candidates for the sixth revolution of vaccinology, including the expanded use of combination vaccine strategies, new adjuvants, vaccines for non-infectious diseases, and the advent of systems vaccinology. Ultimately, he settled on new delivery systems. Interestingly, just as the breakthrough in cell culture expanded the role of attenuation and killed vaccine strategies, breakthroughs in immunoengineering and novel delivery systems have led to multitudes of promising vaccine platforms with great potential to advance innovation in pediatric vaccinology.",

            "text": "6][17] Individuals are also susceptible to reinfection with heterologous strains. 18,19 lthough details regarding the immune correlates of protection are limited, current evidence indicates that protection is dependent, at least in part, upon the generation of a delayedtype hypersensitivity-like TH1 immune response that activates interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-secreting T-cells, and antibodies that opsonize and neutralize T. pallidum organisms. 20,21 yphilis vaccine development has been designated by vaccine development oversight committees as being between the basic and pre-clinical stages on the vaccine development continuum. 22 The host interfacing outer membrane proteins present on the T. pallidum surface have long been known to be important targets for vaccine design; computational analyses performed over two decades ago identified a complement of candidate outer membrane proteins in T. pallidum, 23 and more recent analyses targeting the \"OMPeome\" have advanced this line of investigation. 24 Current high priority syphilis vaccine candidates that are in the pre-clinical assessment stage target known or suspected T. pallidum outer membrane proteins and, to date, all have been pursued as protein subunit vaccines. These include proteins such as Tp0751, 25 Tp0136, 26 Tp0326, 27 Tp0633, 28 Tp0856, 29 and Tpr family members including TprK (Tp0897). 30,31 An important consideration from a manufacturing standpoint is that only two of these vaccine candidates have been successfully produced as soluble and stable recombinant proteins (Tp0751 and Tp0136); the other vaccine targets being pursued are beta barrel-containing integral membrane proteins, which require complex re-folding and additional quality control (QC) measures that are not conducive with vaccine manufacturing requirements. Since current syphilis vaccine candidates being pursued have elicited partial protection at best, 25,30,31 it is apparent that an effective syphilis vaccine will require induction of an immune response against multiple T. pallidum proteins, an expensive endeavor from a manufacturing standpoint.",

            "text": "Vaccination of animals against infectious diseases has proven to be one of the most costeffective means of reducing animal suffering and economic losses due to bacterial and viral infections. However, infectious diseases continue to be a problem despite the continued use of conventional products for decades. The technology for vaccine development and production has remained basically the same for the past 200 years, involving the use of either killed organisms combined with an adjuvant or live organisms with reduced virulence. Advances in immunology and pathogenesis over the past two decades, based largely on recombinant DNA technology, monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics, have formed the basis for a new generation of veterinary products'which are starting to enter the marketplace and should continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Subunit vaccines composed only of protective antigens are now cost L.A. BABIUK and A. A. POTrER effective to produce using gene expression technology in a number of systems, including bacteria, fungi, insect cells, and destructive or non-destructive mammalian systems. In parallel with the identification and production of subunit antigens, new adjuvants and delivery systems are being developed which allow one to stimulate the appropriate immune response (antibody vs. cell-mediated) at the desired site. Since many viral and bacterial pathogens colonize mucosal surfaces, delivery of the antigen to this site is crucial for stimulation of the mucosal immune system. New carriers such as cholera toxin and microcarriers, or the use of cytokine::antigen chimeras, offer the ability to deliver subunits to mucosal surfaces. Live vectors are arguably a better choice for stimulating mucosal immunity, and rapid advances have been made in the development of live bacterial and viral vaccines based on rational attenuation methods. While live vaccines have been used for a number of years, the exact mechanism of attenuation was often unclear and the genetic lesion responsible for the reduction in virulence was not characterized. Therefore, the possibility of reversion to virulence remained a remote possibility. \n\nRational attenuation relies on the construction of well characterized deletions in specific genes coding for essential physiological functions or virulence determinants.",

Session co-chair, George Georgiou, will describe his approach to quantifying individual antibodies comprising the serum antibody response through a combination of HTS of the recombined Ig genes from antigen-specific B cells and mass-spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments generated from antigen-specific Igs from the blood. Examples of deep analyses of serum antibodies elicited by vaccination and against pathogenic cells will be described. Brandon DeKosky (Vaccine Research Center, NIH) will follow with the use of paired VH-VL read technology in developing sequential vaccines that reiterate the ontogeny of neutralizing antibody development for a class of HIV-specific antibodies. Daniel Emerling (Atreca, Inc.) will report on clinicallevel studies of immune repertoires based on sequence analysis of the two chains of antibodies. One example involves patients during a vaccine trial, with Ig-repertoire analyses of B-cells and plasmablasts informing vaccine strategies. Ludvig Sollid (University of Oslo) has been working on the role of B-and T-cells and antigens in celiac disease; he will describe the interaction of antibody and TcR repertoires, along with the role of proteolytic products of the autoantigen, gluten, in driving this disease. Jake Glanville (Stanford University) has developed methods for deducing antigen specific B and T-cell receptors out of high-throughput sequencing data. This would provide a computational approach to identifying both B-and T-cell clones involved in immunological processes, including in the absences of knowledge of the etiological agent. Johanna Olweus (Oslo University Hospital) will describe her approach of using the TcR-repertoire data derived from healthy individuals to discover TcRs that can recognize cancer neoantigens. This provides a way of discovering cancer-specific TcRs that can be \"implanted\" into autologous T cells, then expanded and activated to specifically attack a patient's tumor cells.",

            "text": "hosts [30]. Proteinbased vaccines are intrinsically safer than whole pathogen-based vaccines and are faster to adjust. Yet, despite extensive efforts  toward development of protein-based mucosal vaccines against various infectious diseases, there are currently no approved oral or intranasal protein vaccines. Integration of LTB in protein vaccines has been shown to enhance immune responses. In addition, live bacterial cells as delivery vehicles for recombinant antigen have been suggested to serve as effective adjuvants due to their potent activation of the innate immune responses [18,31]. For example, a recombinant subunit vaccine containing the R repeat region of P97 adhesin of M. hyopneumoniae fused to LTB and expressed in E. coli, produced high levels of systemic and mucosal antibodies in intranasally or intramuscularly inoculated BALB/c mice [32]. Similarly, LTB-fused recombinant C-terminal fragments of botulinum neurotoxins serotypes C and D, produced in E. coli, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies [33]. The same recombinant vaccine induced a strong immunogenic response in cattle as well [34]. Nandre et al. report on a significant reduction in egg and internal organ contamination by virulent Salmonella enteritidis (SE) in laying hens orally inoculated with live attenuated LTB-secreting Salmonella enteritidis (SE-LTB) as compared to those receiving a commercial anti-SE inactivated vaccine [35]. In line with these studies, the current work demonstrated the safety and potency of E. coli as a vaccine delivery platform, as well as the additive effect of LTB integration in vaccine design. The presented vaccine was designed to simultaneously target several epitopes, with the goal of increasing humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity and providing for more robust control and prevention of IBV disease. The research focused on the S and N proteins, in light of evidence of the role of both S1 and N genes in the induction of immune responses against IBV [36][37][38]. Specifically, Meir et al. [39] reported on both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following vacci",

            "text": "Although recombinant Salmonella may induce Env-specific humoral responses as shown by the studies mentioned above, the antibodies are unlikely to be neutralizing since the Env expressed by the bacteria lacks post-translational modifications found in nature. However, the Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses elicited by the recombinant bacteria should have the potential to protect against HIV infection. The non-neutralizing Envspecific antibodies induced by the bacteria may also have the potential to protect against HIV infection through antibodydependent cell-mediated pathway. \n\nSalmonella enterica vaccine vectors have also been used to express HIV-1 Gag antigens [reviewed in 28]. Most of the studies have shown that Gag expressed in Salmonella could provoke HIV-specific immune responses in mice [28]. Briefly, recombinant Salmonella expressing HIV-1 Subtype C Gag elicited Gag-specific CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses as well as Gag-specific IgG1 (Th1) and IgG2a (Th2) responses [29]. Recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine secreting HIV-Gag (p24) using the hemolysin secretorial signal of E. coli was also shown to elicit Gag-specific humoral and T cell responses in mice [64]. A recombinant Salmonella expressing HIV-1 Gag fused to the secretable bacterial Type III secretion system SopE protein elicited Salmonella-specific mucosal immune responses in vaccinated human volunteers, but no HIV-Gag specific responses were detected after a single dose [65]. Boosting with the same recombinant vector could have induced HIV-Gag-specific responses. Recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi expressing HIV-1 Gag from the bacterial chromosome also elicited systemic Gagspecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in mice vaccinated intranasally [63]. Recombinant Salmonella vaccine vector expressing codon optimized HIV-1 Gag induced Gag-specific mucosal CD8+ T cell and humoral responses in mice vaccinated orally [66].",

            "text": "Subunit vaccines consisting of recombinant protein antigens are very promising due to their safety, ease of production, and capacity to elicit targeted immune responses directed towards desired epitopes. However, when delivered by themselves, these antigens often fail to generate robust and long-lasting immune responses, necessitating strategies to enhance their immunogenicity (1). Protein fusions to a variety of bioengineered IgG-based scaffolds have demonstrated tremendous potential as therapeutic candidates, acting to enhance the solubility and stability of the fusion partner while also allowing simple and cost-effective purification via protein A/G affinity chromatography (2). Furthermore, by interacting with neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) in the body, IgG fusions can escape lysosomal degradation, thereby extending the serum halflife of the Fc-fusion (3).\n\nThough less well explored, IgG fusions also have many desirable characteristics for vaccine development. Antigenpresenting cells can uptake and process IgG-bound antigen via FcRn receptors (4,5), complement receptor C1q (6)(7)(8) and Fcg receptors (9). However, not all IgG subclasses interact equally with immune receptors. IgG1 and IgG3 are immunostimulatory, while IgG2 and IgG4 have weak effector functions (10). IgG3 mediates the strongest complement activation and Fc receptor binding, however it has significantly reduced serum half-life, and thus most IgG-fusions vaccine strategies use human IgG1 (11). In addition to these factors, the polymeric state of an antibody also affects its immunological properties. Both C1q, the first component involved in complement activation, and the low affinity Fcg receptors require high avidity binding for activation. For this reason, monovalent Fc-antigen fusions cannot efficiently utilize these pathways. By contrast, larger antigen-antibody immune complexes with multivalent Fc domains can efficiently bind C1q and cross-link Fc receptors, resulting in greatly improved uptake and presentation by dendritic cells, and subsequently improved activation of T-cells (6,(12)(13)(14).\n\nCapitalizing on the benefits of antigen-antibody immune complexes, a variety of vaccine strategies have",

            "text": "The use of mouse hybridomas generated from stable fusions of immortalised myeloma cells with B cells of immunised mice provided highly specific monoclonal antibodies that could be used in therapy (Kohler and Milstein 1975). Mouse antibodies initially used in human therapy did not interact well enough with different receptor types resulting in inefficient effector functions and rather short terminal half-lives. Furthermore, the mouse antibodies were found to induce severe immune responses in humans (for rev. see Carter 2006). The development of innovative recombinant DNA technologies, including chimeras and humanisation of mouse antibody molecules, greatly enhanced the clinical efficiency and safety of murine-derived monoclonal antibodies. For almost 15 years, phage display has been used for the selection of specific antigen-binders from artificial libraries of single chain antibodies. Filamentous phages have been developed that carry the genetic information to express foreign proteins on their surface. This assures the coupling of phenotype and genotype during phage amplification and affinity selection. The ability to generate large antibody libraries, and the simplified antibody-backbone of a single chain antibody, has made antibody-phage display a powerful tool for the development of new therapeutic agents (for rev. see Hoogenboom et al.  1998; Kontermann and Duebel 2001; Winter et al.  1994). In parallel, new and evolving molecular strategies are helping to enhance affinity, stability and expression levels (Boder et al. 2000; Hanes et al.  2000; for rev. see Kurtzman et al. 2001; Low et al.  1996). The high cost of antibody production in mammalian systems has limited the wider use of antibody therapeutics (Scott 2005). These problems are essentially important for the application of antibody therapeutics in veterinary medicine. \n\nProduction shortfalls and high costs are providing the impetus for further development of alternative antibody production technologies (Chadd and  Chamow 2001; Fischer et al. 2004; Kipriyanov and  Le Gall 2004). Infectious diseases are on the rise world-wide. It is estimated that 58% of the 1,407 recognised species of human pathogens are zoonotic, i.e. infect more than one host.",

            "text": "Orf is a highly contagious zoonotic disease of small ruminants caused by Parapoxvirus. Kisspeptin, encoded by the KISS1 gene with its cognate receptor GPR-54 is recognized as an upstream orchestrator in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This study was designed to construct a DNA vaccine that produces a fused peptide composed of a major immunodominant protein of the orf virus (B2L) and kisspeptin-54, a neuropeptide with recognized roles in mammalian reproductive biology. The administration of this recombinant vaccine is shown to produce a significant antibody and cell-mediated immune response directed against B2L compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, we found that rats inoculated with PBK-asd vaccine up-regulated antigen-mediated splenocyte proliferation and significantly raised antigen-specific tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1-), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03d2) and interleukin (IL-2) compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This recombinant vaccine also stimulated antibody responses to kisspeptin and decreased serum luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels. Moreover, the current recombinant vaccine caused testicular atrophy and arrested spermatogenesis. It is concluded that this recombinant B2L and Kisspeptin-54 vaccine could be a promising approach for construction of bivalent orf virus and immunocastration vaccine. Furthermore, we concluded that the orf virus envelope protein (B2L) could be used as an immunomodulator for kisspeptin-54 to produce a strong antibody response.",

            "text": "The availability of two licensed and approved vaccines for the prevention of shingles afforded a unique opportunity to conduct extensive evaluations of the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to each vaccine. This was particularly useful in this instance because the efficacy of the two vaccines was very different. A cohort study of several hundred participants examined cytokine responses in multiple subsets of T cells, both CD4+ and CD8+, as well as other measures of the cell-mediated response over a five-year period post-immunization [77][78][79]. The humoral immune responses were evaluated beyond simply measuring virus-specific IgG levels, including IgG avidity to both purified gE and to a mixture of all VZV glycoproteins, and neutralizing antibody titers [80]. Effector and memory T cell responses to recombinant vaccine were more than 10-fold higher than in those receiving the live-attenuated vaccine. The avidity results revealed that nearly all of the participants in the study had moderate to low avidity to gE, either due to a waning of high-affinity antibodies or a failure to attain high levels when primary infection occurred. Nearly every recipient of the recombinant vaccine experienced boosts in gE IgG avidity to the maximum level measurable by the assay, compared with largely unremarkable boosts from live vaccine recipients. For neutralizing antibody, the average increases in titer for live virus recipients was eight-fold, compared with 22-fold for recombinant vaccine recipients. Since affinity maturation is crucially dependent on specific forms of T cell help in the germinal centers, these results also reflect a preferential boosting of B cell memory by recombinant vaccine [81,82]. This was also reinforced by the duration of observed boosting. At the end of five years, most of the boosts in avidity due to live virus vaccination had returned nearly to baseline, whereas most recombinant vaccine recipients retained 70-80% of their boosts [80]. These aspects of the responses to the two vaccines would have gone unnoticed while the vaccines were in clinical trial.",

            "text": "In addition, Vaccination with recombinant fusion antigens physically linked with flagellin has shown greater efficacy [40]. To date, four candidate vaccines based on flagellinfusion technology have entered clinical trials, including a plague vaccine, recombinant M2e-flagellin influenza vaccine (STF2.4xM2e, VAX102), recombinant HA-flagellin influenza vaccine (STF2.HA1 SI, VAX125) and a prototypic quadrivalent seasonal HA-flagellin influenza vaccine (STF2, VAX2012Q) [41]. The plague vaccine, a recombinant flagellin-F1-V protein against Yersinia pestis, is evaluated in a phase I clinical trial [42]. VAX102, a recombinant of four copies of the ectodomain of M2e antigen and Salmonella typhimurium flagellin phase 2 (STF2), and phase I trials show a fourfold rise in anti-M2e antibodies in human [43]. VAX125 vaccine consists of the globular head of the HA1 domain of H1N1 fused with STF2 and has advanced to phase II study, making it a promising candidate for the prevention of influenza A disease in elderly patients [44]. VAX2012Q comprises four hemagglutinin subunits, each fused to a flagellin protein, and was studied in a phase I clinical trial. All four components of VAX2012Q elicited seroprotective immune responses against respective influenza type A or B viruses, and no safety concerns were reported [45]. Flagellin enhances antigen immunogenicity and induces both humoral and cellular responses against infectious pathogens, making it a promising tool for the development of novel vaccines. Although none of the flagellinadjuvanted vaccines has received approval for sale or use, a flagellin-fusion influenza vaccine has advanced to phase II studies. Phase III studies of flagellin influenza vaccines are expected to be completed within the next five years.",

According to Table 4, recombinant antibodies technology has lower production costs, has a better affinity for the analytes that are not immunogenic, and can be implemented in recombinant bacterial reactors with higher yields than conventional technologies. However, its development requires recombinant technology and protein engineering. \n\nRecombinant antibodies improve diagnosis accuracy through biomarker detection. An example can be found in the generation of a phage display library that was screened against recombinant HEK-293 cells with the variant CD44 biomarker for gastric cancer cells. Through immunofluorescence analysis, HSCORE, ELISA assay, and other characterization tests, it was observed that one phage candidate, denominated ELT, was the best one to diagnose gastric cancer via CD44v6 biomarker [31]. On the other hand, single-chain variable-fragments (scFv), which are fusion proteins of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody (V H and V L ) connected with a short linker peptide of 10-25 amino acids, may be coupled with phage display libraries to create recombinant antibodies, as was the case of Tadano et al. [32], where candidate phages were cloned to bind with higher specificity and affinity to a cancer stem-like antigen, resulting in a possible new therapy for patients with carcinoma and bone sarcoma. Regarding breast cancer therapy, the Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) in Notch signaling becomes a target for this type of cancer. Sales-Dias et al. [33] developed anti-DLL1 antibodies from scFvs. As a result, the antibody IgG-69 was able to disrupt the DLL1 activation of the Notch signaling pathway.",

Research into the development of antibody-based therapies is further strengthened by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant clinically significant bacteria (eg. Staphylococcus aureus or Salmonella typhi ). Antibody half-life in vitro is typically short therefore passive immunization provides only temporary protection and needs to be repeated. Innovative technologies to extend the half-life of monoclonal antibodies raise high hopes. One such example is the mutation of the Fc region of an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody to increase its binding to the Fc receptor. This induces changes in the pharmacokinetics of human serum antibodies which increase to 100 from the typical 19-34 day half-life while maintaining virus-specific neutralizing activity. While passive immunization may be sufficient for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of acute infection or disease in remission, long--term immunity requires active immunization with \"engineered\" vaccine. It should be emphasized that effective methods of passive immunization may serve as basis for the development of novel and high quality vaccines.",

            "text": "As the PrP is a ubiquitous protein abundantly expressed in the CNS and PrP Sc shares the same primary structure, no immunological response arises against prions, a phenomenon known as autotolerance [162,163]. The aim of the immunological therapy is to overcome this autotolerance and induce the immune system to generate antibodies which upon binding to PrP could impede its conversion to the pathogenic isoform. For that purpose, rec-PrP is used like a vaccine antigen to induce the production of auto-antibodies. The effectiveness of the immunological therapy has been shown in different models. Using dimeric mouse rec-PrP expressed in E. coli, auto-antibodies were generated in mice which demonstrated their efficacy by inhibiting the formation of PrP Sc in cell-culture models persistently infected with prions [164]. Mouse rec-PrP immunization was also shown to provide protection in vivo, delaying the development of the disease when used as a prophylactic therapy in mice [165][166][167]. Furthermore, immunization with rec-PrPs from other species, such as bovine rec-PrP, delayed the disease onset in mice inoculated with rodent-adapted prions [152]. Apart from mouse models, the ability of rec-PrPs to boost the immune system has been shown in hamsters immunized with recombinant hamster PrP [151]. Altogether these works demonstrated that the use of rec-PrP to promote an immune response against prions may be an effective prophylactic approach to prevent the development of TSEs. \n\nSince the generation of the first recombinant misfolded PrP [42], several in vitro models have been developed based on this technology. Due to these techniques, different aspects of the molecular mechanisms responsible for prion misfolding were unravelled, important improvements in TSEs diagnosis were made, different anti-prion compounds were discovered and new therapeutic strategies were developed. The development and production of recombinant PrP has demonstrated its enormous potential for further understanding of these devastating prion disorders.",

            "text": "Recombinant viral vectors have been extensively studied as a promising vaccine platform due to their ability to express the antigens, stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, and generate potent antibody titers, all without the need for external adjuvants [169,170]. Multiple vaccine candidates have been developed for CCHF using various viral vectors, including the modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) [171,172], recombinant adenovirus type 5 (AdHu5) [173,174], recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChA-dOx2) [175], recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) [176], and recombinant bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BoHV-4) [174]. \n\nThe MVA vector was used to create the CCHF MVA-GP vaccine candidate, and it encodes the entire M segment open reading frame (ORF) of the IbAr10200 CCHFV strain. Following intramuscular administration twice, the MVA-GP vaccine has shown the capability to induce NAbs and T cell responses leading to complete protection against intradermal lethal challenge in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice (Table 1) [171]. Dowall et al. demonstrated that MVA-based vaccines effectively stimulate both immune system arms, essential in eliciting protective effects against lethal CCHFV challenge [177]. \n\nA recent study found that the ChAdOx2 CCHF vaccine, which employs a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus to express the entire M segment of CCHFV, produced comparable results to a study using the MVA-GP vaccine. This study has been conducted to examine the immunogenicity and protection provided by the ChAdOx2 CCHF vaccine either alone or combined with the MVA-GP CCHF vaccine. They found strong antibody responses and IFN\u03b3-mediated cellular immunity upon administration of various vaccine combinations in both immunocompetent BALB/c and immune-deficient A129 mice.",

            "text": "The epitope peptide vaccine has also been used in immune prevention against viruses (7,8). The epitope vaccine is a synthesized polypeptide based on the information of B-and T-cell epitopes. Utilization of these vaccines may protect the body against specific pathogens by activating B cells to produce specific antibodies. These vaccines potentially acti-vate the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 + T cells) to eliminate virus-infected cells (9,10). In addition, CD4 + T cells may be activated to mediate humoral immune response. \n\nThe wide application of immunology, genetic engineering, protein engineering, synthetic peptide technology, peptide library technology, biophysical techniques, immunoassay technology and computer technology have resulted in the identification of additional antigen epitopes. Lightowlers et al (11,12) demonstrated that sheep (intermediate host) immunized with the Eg95 recombinant protein vaccine were protected against oncosphere infection. The immune protective effect was \u226495-100%, of which 86% were fully protected. These data suggest that Eg95 is an ideal protective antigen. In a previous study (13), Eg95 gene was identified as a candidate gene in Echinococcus with high antigenicity. Additionally, the secondary structure of Eg95 had many random coils, which indicated a high flexibility. The regions with a high flexibility were potential epitope regions. Previously, we also predicted the T-and B-cell epitopes of Eg95. In this study, in order to examine the antigenicity of Eg95, we initially predicted its tertiary structure. Based on the T/B epitope information obtained as well as the tertiary structure, the T-and B-combined epitopes of Eg95 were analyzed. The results of the present study therefore provided additional evidence on the epitope information of Eg95.",

            "text": "Therefore this approach allows the investigation of the humoral immune response without prior restriction to a certain protein class. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the fraction of sequences incorporated in a recombinant DNA library depends on the degree of partial DNA digestion [35]. The size of OPV proteins ranges from less than 50 amino acids to more than 1,000 amino acids, implying methodical problems. On the one hand, it is preferable to identify single OPV proteins during the screening process by using inserts of even shorter length. On the other hand, short inserts could result in the translation of incomplete proteins that lack the proper folding for obtaining the native immunogenic structure. To circumvent this and other limitations, EL containing inserts of different size were constructed. Moreover the serological screening of genomic EL is not an absolutely quantitative method but rather a qualitative approach. There is no guarantee that all immunoreactive proteins will be recognized and identified even when specific antibodies are present. However, due to the number of clones screened, several immunogenic proteins should be found. This constriction has been enhanced by pre-diluting the immune sera from 1/200 to 1/1,000. This elicited only the discovery of the most antigenic proteins that could be suitable for inclusion in vaccines. \n\nAntigens expressed in E. coli may not completely parallel those expressed in OPV-infected eukaryotic cells, due to a lack of posttranslational modifications. Additionally, solid-phase immobilization of library-expressed proteins may mask protein epitopes or affect the three-dimensional structure of the antigens. To assess the impact of these factors on the ensuing screening experiments, anti-rA27 antibodies were tested in ELISA assays. The anti-rA27 antibodies were generated in goats and mice immunized with a recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. The specificity of these antibodies was tested in ELISA by coating the recombinant protein as well as VACV particles. The antibodies were shown to recognize both. Thus, the immobilized recombinant A27 protein expressed in E. coli and coated onto plastic was still in a conformation similar to that present on virus particles.",

            "text": "methods.\n\nAntibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays have been used to estimate antibody responses to hundreds of recombinant antigens and allow the screening of high-density protein arrays for enzyme-substrate, DNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions (Bensi et al. 2012;Emili and Cagney 2000). Furthermore, long-lasting humoral responses against different pathogens can be analysed for diagnostics, understanding pathogenic mechanisms and for the development of vaccines against bacteria, protozoa and viruses (Zhou et al. 2015;Kempsell et al. 2015;Felgner et al. 2009;Vigil et al. 2011;Crompton et al. 2010;Duke-Cohan et al. 2009;Fernandez et al. 2011). Despite several advantages, some of the limitations with protein microarray are (1) non-recognition of misfolded or multimeric proteins (2) requirement of additional procedures for identification of PTMs or non-protein antigens (3) requirement of expensive fluorescent microarray scanner and sophisticated statistical methods (4) requirement of expensive robotics for printing arrays. Antibody microarray was found to be the most versatile multiplexed immunoassay technology that was used for the exploratory detection and study of protein abundance, function pathways, and potential vaccine /drug targets. Applications of antibody microarray in basic biology and clinical studies have been recently detailed out providing insights into the current trends and future of protein analysis (Chen et al. 2018).\n\nApart from application of omics-based tools and reverse vaccinology, development of nucleic acid based vaccines have gained attention in last three decades. It combines the positive aspects of live-attenuated vaccines, viral vectors and subunit vaccines. Nucleic acid based vaccines include viral vectors, plasmid DNA (pDNA) and RNA. These vaccines have their own advantages such as (1) induction of both B and T-cell responses; (2) specificity; (3) high stability; (4) economical; (5) no anti-vector immunity. Published research reports show faster progress in nucleic acid based vaccine development against viruses in comparison to bacterial pathogens. Few reports came up showing potential of these vaccines against bacterial pathogens (Maruggi et al. 2017",

            "text": "The humoral immune response generates polyclonal antibody responses targeting multiple epitopes and mediating a broad variety of effector functions. The use of passive serotherapy was pioneered by Emil v. Behring and Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d in the early 1890s when they showed that hyperimmune sera of animal origin could protect against diphtheria and tetanus [89]. This approach, in some cases replaced by the use of hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations, is still used to treat several infectious diseases [90][91][92][93][94]. While no polyclonal antibody therapies have entered clinical development in oncology, some technological hurdles have been addressed to enable these products, such as development of methodologies to generate libraries of polyclonal antibodies [95].\n\nThe use of blood-derived polyclonal antibodies faces the obstacles of limited availability, the risk of blood-borne disease transmission, batch-to-batch variability and, more importantly, low specific activity because only a very small fraction of the antibodies are specific for the antigen of interest (thus requiring large doses for efficacy) [93].\n\nOne of the advantages of recombinant oligoclonal antibody mixtures over the 'natural' polyclonal response is that in this case each of the antibodies of the cocktail can be selected, engineered and tuned for high affinity, neutralizing activity and optimized effector functions. This design avoids the sinking effect of decoy epitopes and thus allows the development of antibody-based products able to exceed the potency of 'natural' polyclonal antibodies [96,97]. Another advantage for oligoclonal antibodies is the ability to rationally define an optimal formulation ratio on the basis of systematic preclinical studies (e.g. using pairwise titrations of purified component antibodies) without the significant inconvenience of generating and screening a multitude of polyclonal expression variants.\n\nThe combination of multiple specificities into a single molecule represents an alternative therapeutic strategy to oligoclonal antibodies and a wide number of multi-specific (often bispecific) antibody formats have progressed into clinical development [98,99]. Two bispecific antibodies are approved for use in oncology -catuma",

The emergence and evolution of antibody platforms designed to produce mouse chimeric, humanized and finally human antibodies was a result of the early recognition of the potential of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapeutics. Over the next 25 years, numerous platform technologies intended to produce human antibodies have been developed. The most common classes of antibody platforms include phage display, transgenic animals and in vitro genetically modified cells. Muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) was an IgG2a murine antibody produced with hybridoma technology. 3 OKT3 is produced in patent-pending process of concentrating the B95-8 supernatant to 10x via ultrafiltration 19 and introducing the supernatant to the B cells via centrifugation (\"spinfection\"), 20 transformation efficiency of up to 86% was achieved (Table 2). Following transformation, B cells were suspended in DF media to induce class switching and somatic mutation ex vivo, and were distributed into 96-well plates at 10 5 cells per well. After 21 days, IgG secretion was analyzed via ELISpot and 14.6% of the B cells were secreting IgG, compared to low or undetectable levels for freshly isolated mononuclear cells or B cells (Fig. 2A). Additionally, all human IgG isotypes were found in the library supernatants (Fig. 2B) in expected proportions with IgG 1 being the most abundant and IgG 4 the least. 21 Combining high-efficiency transformation and ex vivo differentiation increased the potential diversity of the human B-cell libraries by including more cells in each donor library and inducing class-switch recombination and somatic mutation, respectively.

Although the data are promising, a challenge for the development of multi-component VLP vaccines will be standardizing the vaccines for each of their components (e.g., quantity of HA vs. NA vs. M1).\n\nAn advantage of using recombinant technology for vaccine design is the opportunity to modularly add or subtract antigens to a formulation. Inclusion of recombinant NA in VLP vaccines has been shown to induce formation of anti-neuraminidase antibodies [87]. It has been noted that different vaccine compositions (e.g., VLP vs. subunit vs. whole virion) induce different immune profiles in BALB/c mice [88]. While the advantages of these various profiles are not yet clear, the flexibility of the BEVS platform enables catering towards different outputs. Besides inclusion in VLPs, recombinant NA can be individually produced via BEVS and may serve as a potentially efficacy-enhancing additive to influenza vaccines [89]. NA immunity is infection-permissive but can reduce infection severity and duration [90]. The potential benefits of including recombinant NA in influenza vaccines has recently been reviewed [90].\n\nOther opportunities have emerged with BEVS as researchers begin pursuit of a so-called universal influenza vaccine. Licensed influenza vaccines offer limited cross protection to heterologous influenza viruses and, thus, there is the need for annual update of seasonal influenza vaccines and concern over pandemic preparedness. A successful universal influenza vaccine would offer long-lasting and broad protection against a range of different influenza virus strains. Approaches to universal influenza vaccine design include HA stalk-based constructs and chimeric HA-based vaccines that are composed of conserved stalk domains fused to \"exotic\" heads, usually of avian origin (these approaches are reviewed elsewhere [91]). The BEVS platform, being based on recombinant technology, offers the flexibility and genetic control required for the design and manufacture of these universal vaccine candidates.",

Their impact on the economic viability of the healthcare system is also very large, since vaccines lower the treatment costs of diseases [7], and reduce the impact and risk of outbreaks [8]. Additionally, by preventing bacterial infection and, subsequently, reducing the need for antibiotic treatment, vaccines can have an impact on antimicrobial resistance [9]. The use of vaccines goes beyond prevention of infectious diseases. Technology advances coupled with progress in target selection and understanding of the immunosuppressive mechanisms have led to the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines [10].\n\nDespite the proven effectiveness of current vaccines, there is still room for improvement in the vaccine technology field. Traditional attenuated and inactivated vaccines are still widely used today (e.g., Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, BCG and Inactivated Polio vaccine, IPV) owing to their robustness and stability. However, they present safety concerns due to the use of whole pathogens and in many cases, they do\u0144 t have a defined composition. In the case of toxoid and subunit vaccines, and despite their safety and stability profile, the use of adjuvants is required for a strong immune response and the protection lifetime is limited ( Table 1).\n\nThe manufacturing of new vaccines is typically a lengthy (6 to 36 months), challenging and expensive process, as no standard process is available [11,12]. To deliver effective, precise, and consistent vaccines it is imperative to use good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant equipment, facilities, and procedures. However, this is costly and difficult to implement at a large scale. Vaccines developed on the basis of traditional technology have failed to respond effectively to several diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS or flu. Furthermore, SARS and Ebola epidemic outbreaks and, more recently, the CODVID-19 pandemic, show that many of the current platforms are not well suited for a very fast, efficient, and cost-effective response.\n\nNew vaccine technology approaches are thus necessary to",

One approach that mines pathogenic bacterial genomes for antigen discovery is known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV). RV has emerged as an effective strategy that uses bioinformatics techniques with the aim to identify highly protective and immunogenic peptides encoded by immunologically exposed pathogenicity factors by screening the entire genomes of microbial pathogens (Movahedi and Hampson, 2008;Seib et al., 2012;Donati and Rappuoli, 2013; Figure 2).

RV starts with the computational analysis of the complete genome sequence of the targeted pathogenic organism. Computational predictions are based on algorithms trained on biological data obtained from experimentally carried out studies. The potential vaccine candidates include surface associated and secretory proteins (SASPs) and virulence factors. These are further evaluated to identify protein candidates with antigenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells. These proteins are then amplified by PCR and expressed in suitable vectors. The recombinant proteins produced are purified and used for immunogenicity testing in animal models (mice). Based on immune sera screening (FACs, Serum Bactericidal Activity), the recombinant proteins capable of inducing sera bactericidal antibodies are selected. The top candidates enter the pre-clinical stage of vaccine development. After the molecular epidemiological studies, the best candidates are used for clinical trials in adults, adolescents and infants and finally they enter the vaccine formulation process. \n\nprotein. The best selected candidates could be tested in the clinical trials for validating their immunogenicity after in vitro immunogenicity examination in cells and animal models.

            "text": "Passive transfer of anti-Rotavirus antibodies from immunised dams to their offspring, and protection of the pups after virus challenge, were observed (Table 1, 4 ). A corn-based vaccine against Porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (PTGEV) boosts the antibody levels in serum, colostrum and milk of immunised gilts, indicating that immunity can be passively transferred to suckling piglets (Table 1, 26 ). Detection of an immune response to the delivered plant-based candidate vaccine was observed in every case (Table 1) when the recombinant protein was given to the animal. \n\nVirus challenge experiments showed protection of the immunised animals (Table 1, 1, 10-15, 18, 27, 29 ). However, the vaccination of rabbits with plantderived CRPV L1 protein did not completely prevent papilloma growth (Table 1, 10 ) . Clinical symptoms of BHV appeared later and were milder in cows vaccinated with the plant-produced truncated glycoprotein D (Table 1, 1 ). It was demonstrated that mice immunised with the plant-derived protective antigen of B. anthracis survived challenge with a lethal dose of toxin (Table 1, 43 ). Although expression of veterinary vaccine candidates in different plant species has been well studied, and their immunogenicity evaluated, challenges for plant-derived veterinary vaccines still remain. Other than barley (Table 1, 46 ), maize (Table 1, 18,26,58 ), white clover (Table 1, 63 ) and alfalfa (Table 1, 4,5,8,11,36,47,62,64 ), which constitute the main components of animal feed, model plants are routinely used as expression systems; the use of crop plants for the production of veterinary vaccines therefore needs to be developed further. Purification technology is essential if plant-derived vaccines are to be administered by injection, and the development of low cost purification methods is important for commercial success. For oral delivery of vaccines very large amounts of the recombinant protein are required, and increases in expression levels remain a major challenge, especially for edible vaccines. Multi-component vaccines, e.g.",

This outcome is not related to high copy numbers being inserted into the host genome, as demonstrated here, which could lead to clone instability [39]. Because the PERC.6H cells are a human cell line carrying the same glycosylation patterns as those found in human blood, immunogenicity risks are reduced. Moreover, human glycosylation patterns favor recognition of the antibody by human immune effector cells, what might potentially increase its therapeutic value. The antibody is currently being produced under GMP conditions. We propose Rebmab200 as a novel targeted agent for cancer therapy, with high potential for treatment of ovarian, renal, lung and breast carcinoma. Phase I clinical trials are planned for translation into the clinic as the next step of development.",

            "text": "With the advent of recombinant DNA technology and modern approaches for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies, there is today an opportunity to develop novel types of antivenoms based on recombinantly expressed antibodies and antibody fragments . Given that it is well-established that animal-derived antibodies and fragments thereof are (relatively) effective in neutralizing snake venom toxins (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017b(Guti\u00e9rrez et al., , 2011, it seems almost self-evident that mixtures of recombinantly expressed human antibodies and antibody fragments could find therapeutic utility if properly developed and manufactured (Casewell et al., 2020;Kini et al., 2018). Compared to animal-derived antibodies, human antibodies are less immunogenic to human recipients (Laustsen et al., , 2016, and if carefully designed, mixtures of monoclonal antibodies, that target neutralizing epitopes of toxins that are medically relevant for human envenomings or disrupt toxin synergism, can likely be optimized to have better efficacy, less batch-to-batch variation, and possibly even lower cost of manufacture (Kini et al., 2018;Laustsen, 2016bLaustsen, , 2018aLaustsen, , 2018bLaustsen et al., 2015Laustsen et al., , 2018a. Given these potential benefits, scientific efforts have in recent years focused on the development of both fully human monoclonal and oligoclonal antibodies  and camelid antibody fragments (Bailon Calderon et al., 2020;Julve Parre\u00f1o et al., 2017;Richard et al., 2013). Combined, these studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using phage display technology for the discovery of such molecules, as well as the potential utility of formulating these into so-called 'recombinant antivenoms' (Laustsen, 2016a). One of the challenges for these types of endeavors is, however, to develop sufficiently broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, which is a necessity for feasible recombinant antivenom manufacture, as the inclusion of antibodies that are able to cross-neutralize multiple toxins allow the manufacturer to limit the number of antibodies needed in a recombinant antivenom formulation (Jenkins and Laustsen,",

The correlates of protection for avian influenza poultry vaccines are well-defined, where experimental studies in Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) chickens established that vaccination-induced HI antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) of 8 or 10 (3 or 3.3 log 2 ) were associated with survival after HPAI challenge, GMTs of 40 (5.3 log 2 ) prevented oropharyngeal shedding in most vaccinated birds, and GMTs of 128 (7 log 2 ) in antigenically closely-matched vaccines and challenge viruses prevented shedding [17,18,19]. \n\nAvian influenza vaccine technologies include chemically inactivated whole viruses (egg-adapted field strain and reverse-genetics generated) or split vaccines; HA proteins expressed by recombinant heterologous virusvectored backbones, in-vitro expressed soluble HA protein subunits administered alone or within nanoparticles, and DNA vaccines. Each of these systems has advantages and disadvantages in speed of production, safety, scalability, cost, mass application, potency and differentiating infected-from vaccinated animal (DIVA) capability that is reviewed elsewhere [9]. A fifth category of IAV vaccine technology rapidly gaining recognition for its scalability potential and high efficacy in in vivo studies is recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are self-assembling macromolecules that mimic the geometry of an actual virus yet lack viral genetic material, rendering them completely non-infectious [20]. VLPs induce broader immune responses than standard split and protein subunit vaccines by directly stimulating dendritic cells, and consequently potent T-cell-mediated immune responses [21]. Recombinant VLPs displaying influenza HA or HA plus other proteins have been produced in E.coli [22,23], insect cells [4,6,24,25], mammalian cells [26,27] and plants [11,20,28].",

            "text": "Due to the presence of cytotoxic T cell epitopes in NS3, this antigen was recently tested in combination with a chimeric DENV/JEV NS1. Mice immunized with this vaccine showed activation of antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, elicited antibody responses, NS3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activities, and protective effects on a DENV2 infection model [40]. Despite the fact that the protective role of NS3 has been demonstrated only in vaccination platforms, such as DNA vaccines [41], the recombinant protein produced in E. coli proved to be immunogenic in mice, leading to activation of antigen-specific antibody and cellular immune responses [39]. \n\nTaken together, these studies demonstrate that recombinant DENV proteins produced in E. coli are capable to induce protective immunity at experimental conditions and, thus, represent promising candidates for testing in clinical conditions. Nonetheless, most of the DENV recombinant proteins produced in E. coli showed reduced solubility and required the use of refolding techniques. This is specifically critical for structural proteins, such as the E protein, for which conformational epitopes are the main targets to neutralizing antibodies [204,205]. In addition, as usually observed with subunit vaccines, DENV vaccines based on recombinant proteins require the use of adjuvants to improve induction of antigen-specific immune responses. Such limitations may influence the development pipeline and translation to clinical trials.",

Pilehchian et al. proved that bivalent recombinant fused ETX-CPB vaccine seems to be protective in mice and rabbit ). Furthermore, a study on bivalent recombinant CPE (C-terminal region) from C. perfringens and the subunit of the Shiga toxin (Escherichia coli) have shown that they were protective in mice (Hosomi et al. 2019). On the other hand, experimental trivalent recombinant CPA, NetB, and TpeL resulted in high antibody titre suggesting them as a candidate vaccine against clostridial disease (Rostami et al. 2016). Also, successful experimental tetravalent recombinant CPA, CPB, ETX, and NetB have been reported (Zaragoza et al. 2019). These research have shown that multivalent recombinant vaccines could be effective in comparison with traditional vaccines in immunization of animals (Goossens et al. 2016).\n\nBioinformatics and molecular biology studies have been conducted on the alpha toxin of C. novyi for identification of the most antigenic regions of the toxin. The result of this study has shown that recognition of a small fragment of alpha toxin with high affinity can produce higher immune responses than whole antigen (Fathi Nahafi et al. 2014). So, these experiments suggested that bioinformatics tools can increase the chances of production of highly antigenic vaccines (Fathi Nahafi et al. 2014).\n\nAlso, several experimental recombinant vaccines of C. novyi alpha toxin have been prepared and evaluated using immunological methods. Results have shown that antibody produced against recombinant proteins was more effective than that of normal toxin (Daryaei et al. 2017;Noshahri et al. 2016).\n\nSoluble antigens are considered as immunogenic components associated with blackleg disease. CctA is the major virulence factor; hence, some experimental recombinant CctA vaccines have been developed and evaluated for the immune response against blackleg. Recombinant CctA vaccine has shown protective against challenge with virulent C",

            "text": "Biotechnology products, in many cases recombinant proteins, are derived from complex expression/production systems that often involve genetically modified host cells (bacteria, yeast, insect or mammalian) and complex growth/fermentation media [1]. The ensuing purification steps may be insufficient to completely eliminate impurities such as DNA, host cell proteins, or endotoxins from the product. As a result, biologics may contain low levels of host cell or process derived impurities [2]. These impurities, which we designate as Innate Immune Response Modifying Impurities (IIRMIs), can potentially stimulate the innate immune system via a host of pattern recognition receptors and foster the development of an immune response to the product. Immune responses to protein therapeutic products, including the production of anti-drug antibodies or cell-based immune responses, are frequent [3,4]. While some immune responses do not appear to have clinical implications, others result in infusion reactions (e.g. hypersensitivity), alter the drug's pharmacokinetics, neutralize or otherwise compromise the clinical safety or efficacy of a product [1,5]. Such is the case for patients who receive replacement therapies for hemophilia or inborn errors of metabolism such as Pompe's disease, where the development of neutralizing antibodies to the replacement therapy deprives the patients from a life saving therapy [6][7][8]. In addition, immune responses to therapeutic proteins can result in loss of tolerance to their endogenous counterparts leading to serious adverse events [1]. Examples of these include the development of pure red cell aplasia in patients treated with EprexH [9], and of thrombocytopenia in patients that received as few as 2 doses of a truncated and pegylated recombinant thrombopoietin [10]. \n\nImmune cells express numerous receptors that respond to conserved microbial molecular patterns [11][12][13]. The family of Toll like receptors (TLR) recognizes distinct highly conserved microbial components.",

On the other hand, the power of antibody detection via resent recombinant protein that expressed in pET vector is better than pGEX vector. In Sachdeva et al.'s study (34), MSP-1 19 kDa and MSP-1 42 kDa recombinant proteins which were expressed separately in E.coli,, were evaluated for immunization and assessment of the diagnostic response in the host. They reported that both recombinant proteins can induce IgG 1 in the host, IgG 2 and IgG 3 subsequently. They also stated that , MSP 42 kDa is better to activate cellular and humeral immunity than the MSP 19 kDa due to either being bigger or having more epitopes in the Nterminal or C-terminal portion containing the two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions. The C-terminal epitopes of MSP-1 19 recombinant protein that expressed by pET vector is capable of activate T cells and induces the production of IgG in the host (35 ). The C-terminal region of both MSP-1 19 and MSP-3\u03b1 recombinant proteins are capable of detecting different levels of IgG sub-classes in infected sera and they reported MSP 19 relative to the MSP-3\u03b1 to be much more protective and immunogenic (36 ). In all the above mentioned studies, it was pointed out that in malaria, the acquired immunity is specific and depends on species and strains in each country. Therefore, global studies may not be fully responsive to the specific needs of each region. In any geographic region, specific and detailed studies should be performed according to the local parasites. This fact that, in this study, all serum samples reacted positively by Western blot examination indicates that expression system for refolding the disulfide bonds of spatial domain in r Pv MSP 42 kDa has operated successfully and simulated with native Pv MSP 42 kDa. These findings demonstrate that MSP-1 42 is a promising candidate antigen for blood stage vaccine development and producing of the diagnostic kits.",

            "text": "has also been used as viral vector in numerous studies to develop recombinant viral vaccines. In this study, the vaccinia virus Tiantan strain was used to construct recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing fusion antigens with different configurations. The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing 4M2e and full-length NP fusion antigen induced strong cross-protection (92%) against a lethal heterosubtypic PR8 challenge at 20 MLD 50 and thus regarded as the optimal one among the four constructs. In the previous study, we expressed the fusion protein NM2e in an E. coli system, and determined its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. However, it is inconvenient and time consuming to express and purify much more alternatives. Moreover, it is impossible to express target antigens in an E. coli system successfully sometimes. Compared with an E. coli system, the recombinant vaccinia virus system has characteristics such as high multiplication capacity, no requirement to purify proteins, and high-efficiency to determine the immunogenicity of target antigens in animal models (Coughlan et al. 2018;Mullin et al. 2016). In fact, we succeeded in constructing and determining the antigenicity of several fusion antigens of NP and M2e efficiently.\n\nIn summary, immunization with a 4 9 M2e and NP fusion antigen not only induced NP-specific humoral and cellular immune response, but also increased M2e-specific immunity, which together led to superior cross-protection against heterosubtypic PR8 at 20 MLD 50 . We concluded that the cross-protection potential correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP. However, the recombinant RVJ-4M2eNP containing 4 9 M2e and full-length NP could not induce significant neutralizing antibodies, which help to reduce the severity and duration of the illness. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce conserved B-cell epitopes of HA to induce an enhanced cross-neutralizing response and protective potency (Koday et al. 2017). Future studies should focus on the development of universal influenza Mice were monitored daily for 21 days after PR8 challenge. A Mice",

While a variety of antigenic envelope and core proteins were identified as potential targets for vaccine monitoring, ana lysis of the antibody signals between positive and negative antigens revealed a relatively narrow dynamic range of fluorescent intensity showing 1-250-fold titer differences. Nevertheless, this approach is very useful for identifying the most immunodominant antigens within this viral proteome in an unbiased fashion. \n\nImmunodominant antigens have also been identified as potential targets of a vaccine for malaria. Here, 250 P. falciparum proteins were generated by IVTT and printed on microarray slides to study antibody responses to both natural and experimental malarial infection [12]. From these antibody-profiling experiments, 72 highly reactive antigens that might represent malaria vaccine targets and provide new information on immune correlates of vaccine protection were identified. \n\nWhile wheat germ rather than E. coli IVTT has also been used to study malaria vaccine antigen candidates [16], one major bottleneck for generating recombinant proteins is the need to clone coding sequences for ORFs into an expression vector plasmid for use Antibody-profiling technologies for studying humoral responses to infectious agents with IVTT. An even faster, less labor-intensive approach called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) can also be used, in which the priming sites for the transcription machinery for IVTT are directly incorporated into the PCR primers. In one study, TAP fragments for producing recombinant P. falciparum antigens for microarray spotting were as good as the standard plasmid-cloning approach [13]. Thus, TAP extends the versatility of this IVTT array technology to rapidly generate large numbers of recombinant proteins for array printing. \n\nOther studies have also successfully employed IVTT antigen arrays and demonstrated the ability of this approach in detecting subtle differences in humoral responses after candidate vaccine and natural exposure. Molina et al. used antigen arrays for studying C. trachomatis, using mice inoculated with live or UV-inactivated Chlamydia.",

Zhao and coworkers presented an oncolytic heterologous recombinant NDV and elucidated its preparation method and related application. Heterologous recombinant NDV could express \u03b1(1, 3) galactosyltransferase [\u03b1(1, 3) GT]. Also, they also engineered the recombinant NDV to express fusion genes that carried and manipulated hyperacute rejection antigens, TAAs, and target molecules, which was the first report using an OV as a transduction vector to carry and express the hyperacute rejection antigen gene. This patent established the production technology for a bioconducted hyperacute rejection T cell attack antibody and T cell aggregation antibody, and it solved the key technical bottleneck of anticancer targeting of hyperacute rejection and produced a T cell-directed anticancer effect [116]. This approach laid a solid foundation to OV-based tumor prevention and treatment. \n\nThe breakthroughs in OV monotherapy have attracted increasing attentions among many researchers in different communities. To improve the clinical therapeutic effects of OVs, engineered recombinant viruses are the primary research direction in terms of future clinical application of OVs. With the rapid development of genetic engineering technology, OVs offer a variety of treatment options for cancer immunotherapy by modulating their unique biological characteristics. remarkable breakthroughs in tumor recession, where OV treatment was highlighted to be the primary contribution [117]. For example, the advent of ICB immunotherapy could serve as the choice to reinforce the clinical antitumor outcome of OVs. Especially, the OV and ICB combined therapy has been validated to be superior to effective than their independent usage in many preclinical studies.",

            "text": "Stockpiling antibody-based reagents that can be rapidly administered to exposed populations would substantially reduce the threat of many biological agents by providing a means of conferring immediate immunity to susceptible persons. For persistent threats for which vaccines are available, this measure would provide additional time for immunization, as well as reducing the threat. Development of antibody-based therapies may reduce the attractiveness of biological warfare as a weapon of terror by providing antidotes to help neutralize the threat. An aggressor could attempt to defeat a passive antibody defense by engineering the agent to express antigenic changes, proteases, or antibody-binding proteins. However, in this arms race the advantage may favor the defender, since it is technologically easier to generate a new antibody effective against the changed agent than to engineer a pathogen or agent to enhance virulence. Antigenic changes by definition create new epitopes that can be targeted by other antibodies. Antibodies can also be engineered to resist proteolysis by altering the amino acid sequence to eliminate proteolytic sites. In fact, a neutralizing antibody preparation can likely be generated much faster than new biological agents can be developed. An example of the rapidity with which therapeutic antibodies can be developed comes from the 1905 epidemic of meningococcal meningitis in New York City, when Flexner generated an effective horse antiserum within months and used it to treat patients before the epidemic abated naturally (94). Although PERSPECTIVE this example is not applicable today, given regulations on the development of therapeutics, it provides a dramatic example of the concept that antibody therapies can be developed quickly. The development of antibody-based therapies relies on technology that can respond rapidly to new threats, whereas construction of new biological agents would almost certainly require considerable basic research and development. The same may not apply to new antimicrobial chemotherapy or vaccines, which often require substantially longer development times.",

The results showed this vaccine could induce the immune system against C. difficile toxin in the gastrointestinal tract (87). In another study, a recombinant fusion protein containing RBD of TcdA and the fragment C of tetanus toxin was cloned in an attenuated S. typhimurium vector and administrated in intragastric and intranasal routes in mice resulting in protective immunity in intestinal and pulmonary mucosa (88). In a similar experience, this recombinant domain was purified and combined with the adjuvanted heatlabile E. coli enterotoxin (LT) and mutant of heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin (LTR72) and administrated intranasally. The results demonstrated that the recombinant-based vector vaccine induced protective immunity in the pulmonary but not the intestinal mucosa (89). Also, recombinant B. subtilis spores were used as vector containing toxins A and B peptide repeats and evaluated as a recombinant vaccine. Based on the obtained results, mice vaccinated with recombinant spores were protected from reinfection (90). Further research has shown that the RBD subdomains of TcdA and the fragment C of tetanus toxin induced anti-TcdA IgG serum response as well as a fecal IgA response in mice. Also, vaccinated hamsters were protected from death following challenge (91). Moreover, a recombinant vaccine containing a C-terminal peptide of toxin A lacking ADPribosyltransferase activity was cloned in E. coli (92). A DNA vaccine containing RBD of TcdA has been developed and generated protective immunity against TcdA toxin in mice (93). Also, an adenovirus-based vaccination against RBD of TcdA showed sufficient humoral and cellular immune response in mice (94). To increase the efficacy, Tian and colleagues have developed a fusion protein containing RBDs of TcdA and TcdB, which was administrated in laboratory animals intramuscularly.",

This new approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0), relies on the isolation and recombinant expression of the variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chain genes of immunoglobulin (focus has centered on IgG) using a variety of molecular tools [341]. Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity. Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens. Growing knowledge in this field could lead to the rational design of new antigens more stable and elicit a high level of functional antibodies.",

Most are currently administered as a single molecule to treat a single disease; however there is mounting evidence that cocktails of multiple antibodies, each with a unique binding specificity and protective mechanism, may improve clinical efficacy. Here, we review progress in the development of oligoclonal combinations of antibodies to treat disease, focusing on identification of synergistic antibodies. We then discuss the application of modern antibody engineering technologies to produce highly potent antibody preparations, including oligoclonal antibody cocktails and truly recombinant polyclonal antibodies. Specific examples illustrating the synergy conferred by multiple antibodies will be provided for diseases caused by botulinum toxin, cancer and immune thrombocytopenia. The bioprocessing and regulatory options for these preparations will be discussed.",

            "text": "Both vaccines and mAbs (passive immunization) are relevant interventions. Vaccines for IFV, rhinovirus, and RSV were initially developed as long ago as the 1940s to 1960s, although with mixed success, mostly because of rapid virus evolution. Improved understanding of vaccine immunology and technologic developments place us now closer than ever to developing highly effective vaccines against the major respiratory tract viruses. mAb therapies to viral infections, such as EBV (rituximab) or RSV (palivizumab), provide passive immunization and are licensed, whereas similar agents targeting influenza and other viruses are in preclinical development. 95 Neutralizing antibodies can bind and inactivate viruses, inhibit viral cell entry (blocking receptor binding or conformational changes), prevent the release of virions from the cell, or modulate immune effector functions. 96,97 Engineering and production strategies to produce antibody fragments, higher-affinity binding, and longer half-life are contributing to a lower overall cost for therapy, 95 although vaccines are still considered preferable in most cases. It is notable that effective neutralizing mAb epitopes can also inform the rational design of vaccines. 98 ifferent types of vaccines to respiratory viruses exist, and these are shown in Fig 2 . Traditionally, either live attenuated or inactivated viruses are used. More recently, subunit vaccines made of detergent-disrupted whole viruses or purified viral proteins are also common. Furthermore, promising approaches use microparticle/nanoparticle material and recombinant technologies to produce broadly immunogenic, often self-adjuvanting, reproducible, and safe vaccine responses. 99 hese delivery systems include synthetic polymers, virosomes, virus-like particles (VLPs), liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, proteins, emulsions, and immune-stimulating complexes. 22 urrently, naturally occurring particles are favored because of safety concerns, 100 even though synthetic polymers, such as poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, are in use, 101 and gold nanoparticles have shown promising results. 102 Self-assembling protein nanoparticles, such as ferritin cages and vaults, have also shown promising preclinical data. 103,104",

            "text": "Recombinant subunit vaccines are some of the most effective and safe vaccines, and novel approaches are of great interest to develop new and improved vaccination strategies. Traditional recombinant technologies use bacteria, yeast, insect, and mammalian cells as expression systems, but recent progress has pointed out some alternative platforms, including plants, transgenic animals, and microalgae species, which show superior potential to clone interested genes. Among them, plants and microalgae are highly promising hosts due to proper expression of antigens and biosafety. Another approach to vaccine improvement is the use of adjuvants in combinations rather than the addition of single adjuvants to the formulations. Research has proven that combined adjuvants provide a higher antibody level and longer-lasting immunization than single adjuvant systems. Finally, the integration of different nanoparticles like virus like particles, ferritin cages, and outer membrane vesicles into the vaccine formulations is an efficient way to preserve the structure of antigens and protect them from degradation. These approaches have the potential to improve the efficiency of recombinant subunit vaccines, but more studies are needed to replace traditional vaccines with these improved alternatives. \n\nfever virus [33], and malaria [34]. Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Schizochytrium sp., Thalassiosira pseudonana, Nannochloropsis sp., and Chlorella sp. are some of the other microalgae species that have proven to possess strong potential for recombinant vaccine production. On the other hand, expression in these organisms may result in an improper glycosylation pattern and a low level of protein. Thus, much more studies are required to replace the traditional expression systems with microalgae species [35,36]. \n\nDuring vaccine development, one of the key components is adjuvants, which play an important role in enhancing and guiding the adaptive immune response to vaccine antigens. In other words, adjuvants promote a rapid immune response, produce long-lasting memory, and lower the amount of antigen that is needed for a successful immunity [37].",

            "text": "Development of a universal influenza vaccine that can provide heterosubtypic immunity and protection against multiple clades has been a long-term goal to protect against influenza infections. There are several strategies [49] under investigation to achieve this goal, including the use of antigens from multiple subtypes to increase the coverage, targeting multiple proteins (e.g., inclusion of HA and non-HA proteins) as antigens, target conserved antigenic regions of influenza antigens, use of chimeric proteins containing stem and stalk HA from different subtypes [50] and use of consensus-based approaches such as COBRA sequences [43] comprising multiple known mutations in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. In addition, vaccine technologies that induce both CD8 T cell-and antibody-mediated immunity are also actively being sought to achieve heterosubtypic protection against influenza. In this study, we have demonstrated, using a prototype vaccine based on the R-DOTAP platform and COBRA H1N1-and H3N2-derived HA or nucleoprotein antigen, that such a vaccine is capable of inducing antigen-specific T-cell responses, neutralizing antibodies against multiple clades of H1N1, and H3N2 strains, and protected mice against challenge with a lethal H1N1 strain. Hence, vaccine formulations containing R-DOTAP and COBRA HA, NA sequences and nucleoprotein from influenza presents strong potential to further the goal of developing a safe and effective universal influenza vaccine. \n\nIn summary, these studies demonstrate that protein subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV2 and influenza that are based on the R-DOTAP platform can induce broadly protective cellular and humoral immune responses and provide a significant dose-sparing effect on the antigen. The heterogeneity of recombinant proteins capable of being formulated and administered with R-DOTAP coupled with the ability to produce multivalent vaccines suggest that R-DOTAP is an excellent candidate for use in a variety of prophylactic vaccines against infectious disease. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that R-DOTAP is highly effective in enhancing the potency of the currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccine, further expanding the potential utility of R-DOTAP.",

            "text": "Such vaccine manufacturing processes rely on the use of recombinant proteins. Among many conventional and emerging cell-based systems for protein production, expression of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals has been achieved using bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast, insect cells, transgenic plants, and transgenic animals, and, more recently, cell-free systems. The choice of the most appropriate expression system to gain scalability and high yield, as well as to reduce cost and time, should be previously identified, and normally requires optimization at the genetic and cultivation level which is product-dependent. A comparison of the expression systems as well as examples of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals is presented in the Table 1. \n\nIn this review, we will focus on the use of yeasts as recombinant protein expression systems, more specifically on the application of P. pastoris as one of the most promising candidates for expression of heterologous proteins. This methylotrophic yeast is also considered a unique host for the expression of subunit vaccines which could significantly affect the growing market of medical biotechnology. A SWOT analysis to use P. pichia as platform technology is shown at Table 2.",

The method has proved to be very useful in evaluating basic B cell biology concepts in health and autoimmunity. Furthermore, valuable mAbs, have been isolated from vaccinated [46], naturally immunized donors [45] and patients with autoimmune disease [76]. In general, mAbs recovered by single B cell antibody technologies may be useful reagents for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic studies and clinical development. Major applications include the prevention of infectious diseases by passive immunization [77] and therapies for disorders currently medicated with serum IgG preparations [78]. A deeper understanding of neutralizing mAbs isolated from immune donors will also be helpful for rationale structure-based vaccine designs. Promising efforts in this reverse vaccinology approach are currently being made in HIV research, and should be applicable in other infectious diseases. In addition, future advancements on microfluidic platforms, including PCR cycling combined with next generation sequencing methods are likely to exceed the current systems and allow for high-throughput Ig gene sequence analyses of individual antibody repertoires. By increasing the availability of such repertoires, single B cell antibody technologies are likely to lead in the development of novel mAb therapeutics.",

            "text": "When purified protein antigens were immunized, modest antibody response with little or no T-cell response were generally induced and multiple injections are required to elicit sufficient antibody responses [2,3]. Immunologist and vaccine users also need vaccine adjuvant materials that can enhance the efficacy of low immunogenic antigens and induce appropriate immune responses for long time (Table 2). The major roles of vaccine adjuvant materials can be discussed in five points of view [8][9][10][11]. The first role of vaccine adjuvant is dose sparing. According to the recent report, it was estimated that approximately 1 billion doses of the vaccine could be produced in pandemic condition, which is insufficient to cover the worldwide population. Therefore, to increase global vaccine supply, both the expansion of vaccine technologies beyond egg-based production to include recombinant vac-cines and the use of adjuvant materials were highly suggested. As mentioned, any recombinant protein antigen-based vaccines are low immunogenic, although they have advantages in manufacturing points of view. In this context, the amount of recombinant pandemic influenza protein antigens can be reduced by combining the antigen with various adjuvant materials. The second one is the capability of more rapid immune response. In a specialized application such as biodefense vaccines for pandemic flu, anthrax and other potential bioterrorism weapons, a single-shot vaccine is highly required. By adding suitable adjuvant materials, the immune response was accelerated and excludes additional vaccination. The third one is the broadeing of antibody response. The substantial antigenic drift and/or strain variations of influenza viruses are one of the big hurrdles in the development of universal vaccine. These pathogens also include human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, and malar-  ia parasite. In this field, the capability of vaccine adjuvant materials that can broaden an immune response profile is essential. The fourth one is the tuning of magnitude and functionality of antibody response.",

            "text": "This trial provided relevant information on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccination protocol, and, at present, more knowledge is obtained from the analysis of the vaccine-induced immune correlates of protection in non-human primates (NHPs) and especially in the efficacy trials that have been conducted in humans (6)(7)(8). On the basis of these analyses, the immune correlates that have been postulated to provide protection comprise a complex combination of individual immune effectors (9) such as i) non-neutralizing binding antibodies targeting the variable loops 1 and 2 (V1/V2) of the HIV-1 Env protein (10), particularly when the antibody isotype was IgG3 (11); ii) Envspecific polyfunctional antibodies, with antibodies that can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (5), but only in the absence of serum IgA responses (12); and iii) T cell responses that can also contribute to protection (13). Furthermore, there is broad consent that protective HIV-1 vaccines will also have to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (14). Therefore, a vaccine candidate or a specific vaccination regimen should elicit polyfunctional responses from both arms of the immune system but with optimal immune features. \n\nParameters that affect, among others, the outcome of immune responses include the antigen design, the delivery system, the administration route, and the number and spacing of immunizations. In addition, the combination of different vector systems including adjuvanted protein formulations in heterologous prime/boost immunization regimens has been reported to elicit more potent immune responses than homologous vectors (15). In this context, major efforts have been devoted to establishing the best-in-class combination of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical trials (16-19).",

            "text": "This study is the first to report that the recombinant CTA1-DD-RBF protein can be successfully expressed in E. coli. The E. coli protein expression system is one of the simplest and most cost-effective systems and is suitable for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins 57 . BLI analyses herein showed that the KD (M) for CTA1-DD-RBF and the 5C4 antibody (specific to pre-F) was lower than that for RBF and 5C4 (1.26E-09). These results suggested that CTA1-DD-RBF could bind the 5C4 antibody with higher affinity than the Post-RBF protein. \n\nCellular immune strength, mucosal IgA and serum neutralizing antibody titers were negatively correlated with disease severity 58 . Intranasal vaccination of mice with CTA1-DD-RBF induced hRSV-specific humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses. The abilities of CTA1-DD-RBF to induce neutralizing serum antibodies and inhibit virus replication in the lungs were superior to those of RBF. Due to the major role of T cell responses in hRSV clearance 59 , we investigated the number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells among spleen cells stimulated with F protein 60 , and intranasal immunization with CTA1-DD-RBF significantly increased the number of IFN-\u03b3secreting cells. \n\nThe ability of vaccines administered via the noninvasive mucosal route to induce mucosal antibody responses in addition to systemic antibody responses has been explored 61 . hRSV infects people through mucosal sites, and the mucosal antibody sIgA provides protection at sites of viral entry 62 . A vaccine that elicits a long-lasting hRSV-specific sIgA response is more protective than one that produces only systemic antibodies 63 . Therefore, we evaluated mucosal sIgA in BALF after the nasal administration of the CTA1-DD-RBF protein. At 14 days after the second immunization, the high antigen-specific sIgA in the CTA1-DD-RBF group was significantly higher than that in the RBF group.",

            "text": "The development and deployment of an effective P. vivax vaccine has become a priority for accelerating malaria elimination in the Asia-Pacific and the Americas (Tanner et al., 2015). To date, however, remarkably few P. vivax vaccine candidates are close to or have reached clinical trials . To expand and prioritize the reservoir of antigenic targets for further functional characterization for use in vaccine or biomarker development, we measured total IgG antibody levels to 38 P. vivax recombinant proteins, investigating their relationship with prospective risk of vivax malaria in a longitudinal cohort of PNG children aged 1-3 years. For the first time, the potential protective efficacy of combination of antigens, and the thresholds necessary for an association with protection were investigated.\n\nAlthough the young children included in the present study are actively acquiring clinical immunity, as indicated by a highly-significant decrease in incidence of clinical P. vivax episodes (Lin et al., 2010), most still had relatively low antibody responses, with more than 10% of children exceeding 10% of adult levels to only 22 proteins. Antibodies to almost all proteins were boosted by concurrent P. vivax infections (n = 30), and 29 increased with age and/or lifetime exposure, indicating the antibody levels are both a marker of concurrent and past exposure to P. vivax. Despite these generally low IgG antibody levels, high levels to 31 of 38 proteins (81.6%) were significantly associated with protection, indicating that these antibody levels have started to exceed the threshold above which antibody levels are biomarkers of protection rather than exposure (Stanisic et al., 2015). Figure 6. Estimated dose-response curves for the associations between antibody responses specific to P. vivax antigens and protection from clinical malaria. Solid black lines depict exposure-adjusted dose-response curves, and the grey shaded regions depict the 95% credible intervals. Histograms show the observed distribution of antibody levels (relative to the PNG immune pool) colored per tertiles (low = blue; medium = green; high = red), and the darkly-colored portions of the histograms show the proportion of individuals with that antibody level who had a P. vivax episode (>500 parasites/m L).

Thus, MNA vaccines offer the potential to eliminate the substantial costs associated with the \"cold chain\" necessary for current vaccines [34,68]. Finally, the MNAs described here are designed to be applied without the need for an applicator or any specialized equipment, supporting the potential for self-administration. As such, these features provide several important advantages that support the future development of MNA vaccines for global protection from rapidly emerging infectious diseases.\n\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate the speed at which vaccines against emerging infections can be designed and produced using the recent advances in recombinant DNA technology. Combining emerging biotechnology methods with bioengineering advances in vaccine delivery strategies, it may now be possible to rapidly produce clinically-translatable vaccines against novel pathogens for human testing and subsequent global distribution in time to significantly impact the spread of disease.",

            "text": "This review has detailed a wide variety of engineered BoNTs that have potential applications that include: non-functional toxin surrogates for vaccine use, antibody development and trafficking studies, applications in several different models of drug delivery, as TSIs designed to be used in nociceptive pathways for pain management and hypersecretion disorders and BoNT chimerics that have been found to have potentially new clinical applications as well as revealing new information about the native toxin domains used to create these hybrids. The most mature application of this technology is appears to be the application of atoxic BoNT derivatives to elicit protective immunity or generate antibodies. These recombinant atoxic BoNT derivates have been successfully produced in E. coli, C. botulinum, yeast and insect cell culture-based expression systems [43,44,51,52]. The catalytically inert BoNTs have been demonstrated to have significantly reduced toxicity (Table 1) that is far above the minimal therapeutic doses required as effective vaccines. These engineered BoNT derivatives have also been demonstrated to elicit greater protective immunity than the individual subunit vaccines, particularly against challenges with dissimilar subtypes [43,44,59]. This is most likely attributed to several different factors. First of all, the presence of additional epitopes on the inclusive domains in the holoprotein vs the individual subunit antigen. Secondly, the recombinant holoproteins may be more structurally accurate than the individual recombinant domains. This could produce more structurally accurate epitopes, including interdomain epitopes, not found on the subunit antigens. The ciBoNTs have also been successfully applied as safe, non-toxic surrogates in generating an antibody response for isolation of antibodies in camelids [45]. \n\nThe recombinant functional BoNTs have potential as useful research tools. Contradictory results when generating and assessing identical novel new inhibitors, antitoxins and vaccines in different laboratories can sometimes be attributed to different toxin preparations. Producing botulinum toxins in house presents several difficult, and expensive challenges.",

            "text": "Vaccines historically represent one of the most established and cost-effective procedures in medicine, having perhaps the greatest impact on human health of any medical intervention. Jenner's smallpox vaccine, for example, eliminated human infection by variola virus and led to eradication of the naturally transmitted virus whose mortality has exceeded 300 million lives in the last century alone 48 . The impact of other vaccines, such as the polio or influenza vaccines, has reinforced the value of the approach.\n\nRecent developments in molecular and cellular immunology, genetics and gene delivery have stimulated a renaissance in the field of vaccine research. In addition to a variety of modified viral vectors, including poxviruses such as canarypox, fowlpox and modified vaccinia Ankara, researchers have developed novel adenovirus serotypes, alphaviruses, adeno-associated viruses and nonviral vectors such as naked DNA that can be used as vaccine vectors for a variety of infectious diseases (Fig. 3). Naked DNA has shown particular promise in a variety of different animal models of infectious disease, including HIV 49 60 . This technology has been evaluated in phase 1 human clinical trials for HIV, malaria and influenza virus.\n\nMethodologies for defining immunogens and rationally improving immunogen design have been greatly improved by advances in structural biology. In the case of HIV, for example, X-ray crystallographic studies of the gp120 protein 61 have yielded important information regarding antigenic determinants on this molecule. Based on the X-ray structure, specific rational mutations could be designed to alter, or expose potential antigenic determinants. The definition of functional structures, such as the helical coiled-coil regions of viral envelope glycoproteins 62 , has also revealed highly conserved functional domains that may be susceptible to neutralizing antibodies or other forms of antiviral therapy. Advances in recombinational PCR 63-65 make it possible to generate large libraries of immunogens that can be selected for desirable immunologic properties.\n\nUndoubtedly the field of vaccine technology will benefit from the sophisticated advances in genomics and bioinformatics. Although these technologies have yet to be applied to large-scale clinical vaccine trials, the large numbers of subjects in such trials and the importance of genetic factors in determining immune responses make this subject a logical focus of",

Optimizing the adjuvant components and delivery methods for individual vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity and reduce unwanted side effects remains a vital area of research and development. Also, considering the heterogeneous nature of tumors, the integration of cancer vaccines with targeted therapies like PROTACs may open new avenues for synergistic anticancer effects. Regulatory considerations add another layer of complexity, with agencies requiring comprehensive data on the quality, safety, and efficacy of the vaccines. The collaboration among pharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, clinicians, and regulatory authorities is essential to navigate these multifaceted challenges. Moreover, health economics plays a critical role in the clinical implementation of cancer vaccines. The cost-effectiveness, reimbursement strategies, and accessibility to patients across diverse socioeconomic strata require careful evaluation and strategic planning. 128,129 The clinical aspects of cancer vaccines encompass a complex interplay of scientific innovation, clinical trials, manufacturing, regulation, and health economics. The field continues to evolve, driven by interdisciplinary collaboration and the relentless pursuit of excellence in cancer care. The potential to transform oncological treatment paradigms is immense; yet realizing this potential requires overcoming multifaceted challenges and leveraging opportunities through continuous innovation and collaboration. \n\nChallenges for the Future Development of Cancer Viral Vaccines. The development of cancer viral vaccines presents a multifaceted and complex landscape that integrates insights and approaches from immunology, virology, oncology, and translational medicine. A key challenge lies in the viral genome optimization, requiring intricate genetic engineering, selection of strains, and attenuation processes to yield precise immune responses. 130 Coupled with this is the need for the exploration and validation of immunomodulatory agents and combinations. Researchers must identify synergistic effects and the proper timing for integration with other therapies like radiation or chemotherapy, all while considering patient safety and efficacy. 131",

            "text": "Reverse genetics has assisted the development of recombinant viral vaccines that can serve as delivery systems for RSV antigens.One such vaccine, which has been well advanced in clinical trials, is MedImmune's MEDI-534 [94,95].This vaccine is a replication-competent vaccine that expresses RSV F [75,96].The backbone is based on a bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 with substituted human PIV3 F and HN glycoproteins.MEDI-534 was tested in non-human primates and also in a phase I study in young children between the ages of 6 months and <24 months.Doses of 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000 TCID 50 were tested in the clinical trial and RSV specific antibody responses were noted in 50% of vaccinees administered three 1,000,000 TCID 50 doses of vaccine with two month intervals.Virus that was shed from study participants revealed genetic changes that were associated with reduced RSV F protein expression.A close analysis of the MEDI-534 vaccine then demonstrated that some of the same genetic variants were minor components of the administered vaccine [97].The implication of these sequence variants is a current topic of discussion.\n\nAnother promising candidate is St. Jude's recombinant, replication competent vaccine (SeVRSV), also developed with reverse genetics technology [75].Sendai virus (SeV), a mouse parainfluenza virus type I with a high sequence and antigenic similarity to human parainfluenza virus type I (hPIV-1), was used as the vaccine's backbone [98][99][100][101][102]. SeV is an attractive vaccine candidate and vaccine backbone, because there has never been a confirmed case of SeV-associated disease in humans.The species specificity of Sendai virus is attributed in part to its unique sensitivity to human type I interferon [103].In small animals a single I.N.dose of SeV induced B and T cell responses within days after immunization that lasted for the animal's lifetime without need for a booster [62].",

            "text": "However, both strategies have their shortcomings. Conventional vaccinations (attenuated or killed) are typically costly to produce, require adjuvants (inactivated vaccines) and multiple doses (live attenuated and inactivated vaccine) to induce adequate immunity, can interfere with maternal antibodies (live attenuated, inactivated), and offer little or no protection. Considering all of these challenges, continuous research is needed for the development of effective and safe vaccines [16]. Therefore, conventional vaccines have undergone considerable improvements, including mutantattenuated (live-attenuated) and subunit vaccines (a type of inactivated vaccine containing part of the bacteria or virus) over the years. Despite these advancements, only a few licensed commercial Salmonella vaccines are available (Table 1), which include live-attenuated vaccines, killed inactivated vaccines, and a few subunit vaccines [17]. Recently, the introduction of new biotechnological approaches in vaccine development generation has led to the development of potential next-generation vaccines, such as recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, bacterial ghost (BGs) vaccines, and reverse vaccinology [18]. DNA, bacterial ghost, and mRNA vaccines, when produced through recent developments in molecular biological techniques, induce robust immune responses against pathogens [19]. Another innovative approach to vaccine development is reverse vaccinology, which combines genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to identify new genes in pathogens that could elicit immune response [20]. However, the development of vaccines remains challenging due to the various Salmonella serovars and their unique pathogenic mechanisms. \n\nTherefore, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the developed vaccines for TS and NTS serovars in different animal hosts. Additionally, we used a systematic review approach to gather pertinent studies regarding the safety and efficacy of developed conventional and next-generation vaccines assessed in various animal hosts for this review, which is primarily intended for a broad scientific audience. This review will provide insights into the key issues that veterinary immunologists are currently facing.",

            "text": "The discovery of monoclonal antibody technology [1] stimulated rapid development of targeted therapies against cancer. The use of monoclonal antibodies as a drug delivery vehicles, or trigger for human immune response is already an accepted method for therapeutic treatment of patients in modern clinical oncology [2,3]. However, initially promising mouse monoclonal antibodies induced development of anti-mouse immune antibody response (HAMA) in patients under repeated monoclonal antibody administration, thus limiting their application [4]. Recombinant DNA technology provides a cheap, useful alternative to monoclonal antibody production, allowing generation of large human recombinant antibody libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous phage and selection of specific human antibodies against desirable targets, useful for therapy [5][6][7][8]. Moreover, phage display also enables affinity maturation of antibodies in vitro through construction of mutant antibody libraries, giving clones of greater affinity [9,10]. \n\nThe possibility of finding high-affinity binders in a recombinant antibody library depends on its quality, which is dependent on several factors, such as library size, diversity and source of immunoglobulin genes. It is known that various lymphoid tissues from immunized or nonimmunized donors, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes [11,12], spleen and bone marrow [13] and even metastasized or drained lymph node tissue from individuals with tumors [14][15][16][17][18] may serve as a source of specific antibody repertoire. Although na\u00efve antibody libraries are more diverse and lead to isolation of antibodies with broad specificities, it is reasonable to suggest that construction of a recombinant antibody library from the immunoglobulin repertoire of someone affected by tumor can provide antibody fragments of higher binding affinity against specific tumor antigens.",

Out of the 13 studies, nine were antibody-based immunotherapies, while the remaining four were vaccine-based. Antibody therapies included ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 Mab (20); nivolumab, a human IgG4 PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitor Mab (11,21); atezolizumab, another anti-PD-L1 Mab (22,26); pembrolizumab, also known as MK-3475, a human IgG4 PD-1 Mab (23,25); and bevacizumab, a recombinant, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor Mab (28). Vaccine-based immunotherapies included TG4010 genetic vaccine, which is a suspension of a recombinant modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA), coding for the MUC1 tumor-associated antigen and interleukin-2 (19,24); tecemotide (L-BLP25), a tumor associated MUC1 antigen-specific immunotherapy, that is capable of inducing a T-cell response to MUC1 (27) and belagenpumatucel-L, an allogeneic whole tumor cell vaccine consisting of four pCHEK/HBA2 (human transforming growth factor-\u03b22-antisense vector)-transfected NSCLC cell lines (29). Immunotherapy dosages and chemotherapy dosages are shown in Table I. Dosage of antibodies varied depending on the study and antibody used. Thus, ipilimumab was given at 10 mg/kg as four doses plus paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by two doses of placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 18 weeks (20). Nivolumab was given at 3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks, for 11 to 13.2 months (11,21).",

            "text": "The aforementioned studies on the antibody indicate that these recombinant flagellar proteins have huge potential for novel targets of vaccine development (Rana et al., 2018). In addition, it is expected that these recombinant proteins can provide us with an extremely useful instrument for examining the host immune response to C. jejuni. Therefore, we have opted for the C. jejuni Omp18, AhpC, and FlgH for the preliminary study on the MAP vaccine. \n\nThe MAP vaccine is composed of the epitope peptide and the high-molecular artificial polymer carrier. The critical step is to screen and obtain the dominant epitope. During the production of antibodies such as IgG, high-titer IgG, these antibodies can only be produced with the assistance of T-cells. Unlike viruses, bacterial surface antigens feature intricate and varying structures. As a result, oftentimes it is hard for the genetically engineered vaccines with a single protein antigen to achieve the optimal effects of immune protection. The reverse vaccinology provides a new strategy of vaccine development in the early twentyfirst century (Fimlaid et al., 2014). At the core of the strategy is to obtain vaccine effective antigens in a swift and reliable manner through genome and proteomics prediction, and the reverse screening is adopted for the antibody. In addition, although it is a vaccine applicable to humans, the results of animal protection experiments must be provided during its development, whereas mice are regarded as the most commonly used experimental animals. \n\nTherefore, in this study, we have adopted the biological information technology to predict the T-B combined epitope in human and mouse Omp18, AhpC, and FlgH, and screened the dominant T-B combined epitope by ELISA and Western Blot. Subsequently, the artificial tandem epitope of AhpC-2/Omp18-1/FlgH-1 was established before being recombined and expressed in success, so that the yield was further improved. Moreover, the antigenicity and stability were effectively enhanced due to the fact that the recombined epitope peptide featured a larger molecular weight.",

            "text": "This was the first study to demonstrate that a recombinant Salmonella expressing cytoplasmic HIV-1 gp120 could induce an immune response in mice. Later, recombinant Salmonella expressing the HIV-1 gp120 on the bacterial surface was constructed and found to be more immunogenic than the one expressing the antigen in the bacterial cytoplasm [61]. Another recombinant Salmonella expressing a truncated derivative of HIV-1 gp120 and displayed in the bacterial periplasm was later constructed and found to be highly immunogenic after only a single inoculation of mice [62]. The vector induced systemic gp120-specific splenic CD4+ Th1and Th2 responses in the spleen after vaccination of mice [62]. The vector also induced strong mucosal gp120specific IgA antibody-secreting cell responses [62]. This study clearly demonstrated that recombinant Salmonellavectored secreted HIV-1 antigens could induce better T cell responses than those expressed cytoplasmically. More recently, a recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi expressing HIV-1 gp120 from a plasmid and HIV-1 Gag from the bacterial chromosome was constructed and tested [63]. Mice inoculated intranasally with the recombinant vector elicited high titers of gp120-specific IgG in the sera and gp120-specific IgA in fecal washes [63]. Systemic Gagspecific and gp120-specific CD8+ T cell responses were also induced in vaccinated animals [63]. This study further highlighted that recombinant Salmonella bacteria could potentially be used to vector HIV/AIDS vaccines. It is now generally accepted that induction of HIV-1 envelope-specific humoral responses is very critical in developing successful HIV vaccines. Although recombinant Salmonella may induce Env-specific humoral responses as shown by the studies mentioned above, the antibodies are unlikely to be neutralizing since the Env expressed by the bacteria lacks post-translational modifications found in nature.",

            "text": "Emerging and re-emerging viruses that cause human diseases are becoming of greater concern for public health. A good example is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus, which first appeared in the human population in late 2002 and eventually infected $8000 people with a 10% fatality rate (WHO, 2003). Today, the avian influenza H5N1 virus poses a significant threat if effective human -human transmission develops, with the potential risk of a Spanish flu-like pandemic (Juckett, 2006;Tellier, 2006;Thomas and Noppenberger, 2007). The emergence of these viruses and other biothreat agents has raised world concerns for their use in biowarfare/bioterrorism and demonstrates the vulnerability of society to biological threats. \n\nTraditionally, protection from pathogens can be achieved by either active or passive immunization. Active immunization in which a vaccine is administered to elicit a protective immune response is generally the desired therapeutic goal. Unfortunately, vaccine development can be slow and expensive, and in the case of biothreat agent vaccines, often fail to have the marketability to attract commercial research and development funding. Passive immunization where specific antibodies are administered is a viable alternative and provides immediate and protective immunity (Casadevall, 2002). In sudden and unexpected terrorist attacks, the immediacy of the protection provided from passive, protective antibodies is especially important. Because the half-life of human serum immunoglobulin is $20 days, passive immunization could provide an effective countermeasure against such biological weapons (Casadevall, 2002). The challenge then lies in being able to rapidly respond to these biological insults with the generation of specific antibodies. \n\nProduction of effective antibodies has been the subject of extensive research and with significant success, i.e. 20 recombinant antibodies approved as therapeutics by the FDA as of 2006 (www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/354677). Many organizations involved in this work either focus on the discovery of novel antibodies and subsequently, outsource necessary optimization efforts or vice versa. In contrast, we utilized technology that comprehensively encompasses both the discovery and optimization components of producing therapeutic antibodies. In addition to eliminating potential coordination issues between organizations, this centralized effort can reduce timelines.",

            "text": "These candidate vaccines largely focused on the 'spike' fusion protein as the target immunogen. For enveloped viruses, fusion proteins are often the primary targets for neutralising humoral immunity due to their surface presentation and critical functional role during host cell entry (13). Fusion proteins are dynamic molecular structures that assume distinct conformations before and after merging the viral and host membranes. The 'prefusion' conformation represents the metastable surface presentation on the infectious virion. Upon engagement, these surface antigens drive membrane fusion by irreversibly rearranging into a lower free-energy 'postfusion' conformation. Immunity elicited to prefusion-specific epitopes is often more protective than immunity to the postfusion form, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent virus-neutralising activity that specifically bind prefusion epitopes have been well-described (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20). Thus, stabilising the prefusion conformation is a common approach to enhance the efficacy of fusion protein vaccines (21). \n\nOf the vaccine technologies mentioned above, subunit vaccines are particularly amenable to molecular characterisation and rational design (22). Recombinant viral fusion proteins can be modified to stabilise their conformation and then screened for the presentation of key protective and prefusion-specific epitopes. Cytotoxic and poorly immunogenic subdomains can be modified or omitted, and by only containing viral fragments without replicative components, the safety profiles of subunit vaccines are typically more predictable than other vaccine classes. Subunit vaccine production is scalable, and antigens can be designed and formulated for enhanced thermostability, reducing deployment costs to increase vaccine affordability and access (22). However, recombinant proteins can be poorly immunogenic and often require two or more doses with co-stimulatory adjuvants to elicit protective antibody and T-cell responses. Further, solubilising or otherwise modifying recombinant antigens can destabilise neutralising epitopes, requiring the introduction of stabilising mutations, multimeric scaffolds and/or heterologous motifs.",

            "text": "The technology described here allows the chemical synthesis of vaccines requiring correctly folded epitopes and that contain difficult or long peptide sequences. The final self-adjuvanting product promotes strong humoral and/or cell-mediated immunity. A module containing common components of the vaccine (T helper cell epitope and the adjuvanting lipid moiety S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine) was assembled to enable a plug and play approach to vaccine assembly. The inclusion within the module of a chemical group with chemical properties complementary and orthogonal to a chemical group present in the target epitope allowed chemoselective ligation of the two vaccine components. The heat-stable enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli that requires strict conformational integrity for biological activity and the reproductive hormone luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone were used as the target epitopes for the antibody vaccines. An epitope from the acid polymerase of influenza virus was used to assemble a CD8+ T cell vaccine. Evaluation of each vaccine candidate in animals demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and that the type of immune response required, viz. antibody or cytotoxic T lymphocyte, dictates the nature of the chemical linkage between the module and target epitope. The use of a thioether bond between the module and target epitope had little or no adverse effect on antibody responses, whereas the use of a disulfide bond between the module and target epitope almost completely abrogated the antibody response. In contrast, better cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses were obtained when a disulfide bond was used.",

The transient expression technology is well suited for pandemic responses, such as that faced with H1N1 influenza strains.\n\nThe ultimate success of plant-based production systems for subunit vaccine and protein therapeutic candidates will probably depend on lead commercially viable targets successfully transitioning through clinical trials over the next few years. Plant-based production systems for recombinant proteins have been researched over the past 20 years, with a proliferation of academic groups and biotechnology companies, together with groups from larger agrochemical companies, developing the expression technologies and lead product candidates. This effort needs to be repaid with positive results in later clinical studies for the field to continue to advance. Notable early clinical stage successes have been recorded, advancing several oral (or edible) vaccine candidates into Phase I trials [14,19,[76][77][78]. However, none of these candidate products have progressed further, largely because they either represented proof-ofprinciple targets or impractical oral delivery vehicles. During the past 5 years, insufficient funding and lack of commercial interest in plant-based oral vaccines has led to this approach slowing, and no oral vaccine candidates have recently entered the clinic. The challenges of guiding novel plant-based oral vaccines through the regulatory process currently outweigh available resources. More recently, there has been an increased focus on using plant-based production systems to generate purified recombinant proteins for vaccines and therapeutics to be delivered by injection. Notable recent examples that have had clinical trial success include a personalized therapeutic vaccine for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma assessed in a Phase I clinical trial [74], IFN-a2b to combat hepatitis C assessed in a Phase IIa clinical trial (http://www.biolex.com), and human glucocerebrosidase to combat Gaucher's disease, which has now progressed into a Phase III clinical trial [8]. These and similar purified protein products represent the current best options for making plant-based production systems for human vaccines and therapeutics a reality. In these cases, the emphasis is on demonstrating that the plant production systems can generate antigen or therapeutic protein of comparable safety potency and efficacy",

            "text": "Therapeutic antibodies have come of age as continuing to be a key, dominant technology in the biopharmaceutical industry. The repurpose of antibodies to many formats have made them versatile to design and tailor highly specialized treatments, including ADCs as a targeted drug delivery system, bispecific and fragment mAb platforms for tailored engagement and increased bioavailability, and recombinant Fc-fusion proteins for an increased half-life and introduced immunological engagement. Further advancements include the modulation of Fc effector functions through manipulations of the Fc, either through isotype switching, glycoengineering, or strategic mutations in the Fc region, along with the PEGylation of fragment mAbs for enhanced half-life. Advancements in discovery, manufacture, and formulation technologies have further propelled the success of therapeutic antibodies, notably through expression system development and the transition from IV to SC formulations. Human-based expression systems have been extensively used in mAb development and are becoming an accepted manufacturing platform for mAb therapeutics. Furthermore, cell-free synthesis technology is giving rise to the potential for higher efficiency in the manufacture process. \n\nThough developments for further generation antibody therapies have led to great strides in producing improved therapeutic outcomes, many facets of the manufacture process and formulation development strategy pose as challenges to be considered. Antibody-based therapies are susceptible to chemical and enzymatic degradation through oral, nasal, or pulmonary routes of administration and are therefore currently restricted IV or SC delivery. Despite achieving maximum bioavailability through IV/SC administration, tissue penetration of mAb-based therapies is poor, which limits their local bioavailability, requiring high concentrations to achieve an effective dose. The stability of mAbs-based therapeutics is a highly pronounced and recurring challenge to be considered, as it affects manufacture yield and formulation considerations. Several strategies are in development to improve the stability of mAbs in order to potentially produce formulations for pulmonary or oral administration. Notably, computational tools have come of age, complementing experimental techniques to derive antibody structure and aggregation prediction. Through these methods, the stability and aggregation propensity of mAb-based therapies have demonstrated improvement through rational mutation and glycosylation within the framework region, which is potentially translatable to all mAbs within the same isotype.",

Apart from HA, additional viral proteins including the NP, NA, M1, and M2, are proposed to be possible targets for universal vaccines (75). Cross-reactive antibodies against these viral proteins from different subtypes have been identified and they are shown to have heterosubtypic protective effects in animals and humans. Various strategies using recombinant proteins/peptides, recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, virus-like particles, viral vectors, and synthetic viruses for inducing heterosubtypic protective effects have been reported. Some of these approaches do not only aim at inducing broadly reactive antibodies but also cross-reactive T cell immunity against influenza infections. Clinical trials of experimental vaccines, such as proteasomal adjuvanted IIV by nasal delivery and MVA-NP + M1 have been assessed by experimental challenge and immune correlates of protection evaluated (Table 1). Previous reports also show many experimental vaccines are not undergoing clinical trials or approved for human use, suggesting a bottleneck to preclinical development (76), which could be attributed to limitations of some animal models to show vaccine efficacy or support needed from industry funding for increasing scale of clinical studies (Table 2).",

            "text": "Antibody-based biotherapeutics have emerged as the most successful class of biopharmaceuticals in recent decades. Starting from the first approval in 1986, we now have more than a hundred marketed antibodies serving patients with previously unmet medical needs. The rapid rise of antibodies as biotherapeutics was facilitated by several technological advances in antibody discovery, manufacturing, product and clinical development, and drug delivery. In this report, we studied the emergence of antibody-based biotherapeutics as the best-selling medicines by analyzing the trends gleaned from publicly available information in their package inserts, reviews of BLAs, and websites of regulatory agencies. We analyzed the data to identify the drivers behind the observed trends. These include: 1) therapeutic purpose; 2) need to improve safety by minimizing adverse effects, e.g., immunogenicity; 3) easier developability via improvements in CMC processes, pharmacokinetics, and dosing frequency; and 4) increased attention to patient convenience. All these drivers are interconnected and will continue to evolve as our collective experience with antibody-based biotherapeutics grows and new therapeutic concepts, molecular formats, and manufacturing technologies emerge. To our knowledge, this report is the first to analyze antibody-based biotherapeutic products from several different perspectives simultaneously and provide a comprehensive understanding of issues involved in their discovery and development. Many useful lessons can be learned from this report. These are broadly summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding the diversification of antibody-based biotherapeutics to different therapeutic areas and recent approvals granted to such molecules for infectious diseases, they continue to primarily serve therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, and hematology. This observation points to significant opportunities for biotechnology to serve unmet medical needs in other therapeutic areas. (b) While a diverse range of different antibody-based molecular formats is reaching stages of clinical development (Phases 1-3), [187][188][189] IgG1 kappa remains the most common molecular format among marketed antibody-based biotherapeutics. This is true across different therapeutic areas, indications, formulations, and routes of administration. The literature shows that this format is also the best understood one from several perspectives of drug discovery as well as development.\n\nScientists involved",

            "text": "BackgroundIn recent years the generation of antibodies by recombinant methods, such as phage display technology, has increased the speed by which antibodies can be obtained. However, in some cases when recombinant antibodies have to be validated, expression in E. coli can be problematic. This primarily occurs when codon usage or protein folding of specific antibody fragments is incompatible with the E. coli translation and folding machinery, for instance when recombinant antibody formats that include the Fc-region are needed. In such cases other expression systems can be used, including the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae). This novel host for recombinant protein expression has recently shown promising properties for the expression of single-chain antibody fragments. We have utilised the L. tarentolae T7-TR system to achieve expression and secretion of two scFvs fused to the Fc-region of rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG).ResultsBased on the commercial vector pLEXSY_IE-blecherry4 (Jena Bioscience; Cat. No. EGE-255), we generated a vector containing the Fragment Crystallisable (Fc) region of rabbit IgG allowing insertions of single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) in frame via Nco l/Not l cloning (pMJ_LEXSY-rFc). For the expression of rabbit Fc-fusion scFvs (scFv-rFc) we cloned two scFvs binding to human vimentin (LOB7 scFv) and murine laminin (A10 scFv) respectively, into the modified vector. The LOB7-rFc and A10-rFc fusions expressed at levels up to 2.95\u00a0mg/L in L. tarentolae T7-TR. Both scFv-rFcs were purified from the culture supernatants using protein A affinity chromatography. Additionally, we expressed three different scFvs without the rFc regions using a similar expression cassette, obtaining yields up to 1.00\u00a0mg/L.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first time that antibody fragments with intact Fc-region of immunoglobulin have been produced in L. tarentolae",

            "text": "The Drosophila S2 system is able induce high level expression of proteins of interest and was therefore chosen to express a plasmid containing the prM and N-terminal 80% of the E gene sequence of DENV-2 [49]. The produced polyprotein is then cleaved by endogenous proteases to release the 80E protein with a native-like N terminus. Two doses of the DENV-2 sub-unit 80E protein were administered to rhesus macaques in combination with one of seven different adjuvants at a three-month dosing interval [49]. Animals were challenged with wild-type DENV-2 two months after the last dose of vaccine. All animals developed detectable neutralizing antibody after the first dose and this response was boosted by the second dose. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were elicited by r80E protein formulated with the adjuvants AS05 or AS08 and protection against viremia was correlated with a higher neutralizing antibody titer at challenge. Recombinant sub-unit E proteins (80E) of the other DENV serotypes were produced using this same system. A tetravalent formulation of the recombinant 80E proteins was evaluated in mice and non-human primate experiments. In some instances, the NS1 protein of DENV-2 was included in the formulation to potentially enhance the immune response to the vaccine [50]. Macaques were immunized with the tetravalent formulation four times (day 0, 28, 67, and 102) and were challenged five months after the last dose. Due to the limited number of monkeys in each group, monkeys were only challenged with DENV-2 or DENV-4. Monkeys developed a robust neutralizing antibody response to all four DENV serotypes and were completely protected from DENV-2 challenge. The recombinant 80E subunit protein of DENV-1 adjuvanted with alum was recently evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial and preparations for a Phase I clinical trial of a tetravalent formulation is being planned [61]. Further development of this vaccine candidate was recently transferred from Hawaii Biotech to Merck and Co.",

RV 2.0 was employed by Lu et al. (58) to identify functional anti-Staphylococcus aureus mAbs induced during bacteraemia. A total of ten mAbs were produced, four of which enhanced opsonophagocytosis of Wood46, a S. aureus reference strain. While three of the four functional mAbs targeted S. aureus antigens with known identities, the fourth mAb reacted with a novel antigen. Recently, Zimmermann et al. (59) also demonstrated that functional anti-MTB surface antigen antibodies can be cloned from patient-derived plasmablasts of reactivated memory B-cell origins, providing further evidence for a role for antibodies in the modulation of potent immune responses toward MTB. Taken together with other studies investigating the importance of antibody-mediated neutralization of intracellular pathogens (60), a role for the vaccine-induced generation of antibodies against pathogens such as MTB and Chlamydia trachomatis, using antigens derived with RV 2.0 is, thus, evidenced. Similarly, Bidmos et al. (61) and Blum et al. (45) cloned functional antibodies from sufferers of meningococcal and Lyme disease, respectively; thus, underscoring the utility of the approach for identifying novel targets in different classes of bacteria. Continued use of RV 2.0 in bacterial vaccine discovery is, therefore, encouraged following the surmounting of technical challenges and filling of research gaps. In the following sections of this mini-review, emphasis will be placed on human mAb cloning and serological correlates of protection, since other related technical aspects of RV 2.0 such as recombinant protein expression, high-throughput sequencing of bacterial genomes and antibody repertoires, antigen identity determination and structure-based antigen design have been reviewed elsewhere (62)(63)(64)(65)(66).",

            "text": "l-T, the first therapeutic vaccine for prostate cancer. The administration of Sipuleucel-T is very different from all licensed preventive vaccines. Blood cells from each individual prostate cancer patient are exposed to a prostate antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase) fused to the cytokine GM-CSF and then re-infused to the same patient (Plosker, 2011). Although the immunization process is very complex and expensive, Sipuleucel-T represents a milestone and may pave the way for a wider use of cancer vaccine immunotherapy based on innovative technologies that allow for simpler immunization methods. Several cancer vaccine candidates, based on recombinant antigens or viral vectors, are in advanced development with promising phase II results (Kruit et al, 2013). If they confirm their partial efficacy in larger phase III trials, the next step will be to combine cancer vaccines with additional immunotherapies such as monoclonal antibodies acting on negative regulators of the immune response (e.g., CTLA-4 and PD-1 Hodi et al, 2010;Hamid et al, 2013) recently described by Science as the 'breakthrough of the year' for 2013 (Couzin-Frankel, 2013).\n\nIn summary, the application of innovative technologies in the last century has allowed for the development of novel vaccines targeting new diseases or new target populations. In the next paragraphs of this review, we will focus on vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases, give an overview of recent clinical trials of some important vaccine candidates in development, and discuss which target populations are not adequately protected by vaccines. Finally, we will assess the novel immunization technologies that can be developed today to address the medical needs of the 21st century (GIVS 2006-2015 at www.who.int/immunization/givs/en/).",

            "text": "Empirical vaccine design has led to the generation of clinically approved vaccines against 26 pathogens, yet similar approaches have failed against HIV [1]. This is due in part to the uniquely high mutation rate of HIV and the low density of envelope (Env) protein on the viral surface, which together restrict the evolution of neutralizing antibodies. Only a limited number of sites of neutralizing vulnerability have been defined on the HIV Env protein, which require highly specialized attachment footprints and angles of attack for antibody-mediated neutralization [2,3]. This knowledge has driven vaccine design efforts to focus on the development of immunogens that display only minimal scaffolded surfaces that solely present the site of neutralization attack [4]. Additionally, methods have been developed to deliver sequential Env immunogens through vaccination. This approach is meant to direct the evolution of humoral immunity to HIV epitopes that render the virus more vulnerable to neutralization [5]. These strategies, among others, have emerged from the hypothesis that neutralizing antibodies are essential for global protection against HIV. However, accumulating data from human and non-human primate (NHP) vaccine studies have systematically challenged this dogma by pointing to non-neutralizing functional antibodies as correlates of protection [6,7]. \n\nThe first large-scale HIV vaccine trials starting in the late 1980s aimed to induce neutralizing antibodies against the HIV envelope (Env) protein [8]. Using a recombinant gp160 protein antigen for immunization, the first vaccine instead elicited high titer binding antibodies in the absence of significant neutralization, and no protection was observed in the trial [9]. The next two large trials VAX003 and VAX004 induced neutralizing antibodies but afforded no significant protection [10]. When vaccination could not drive the development of robust neutralizing antibody responses to confer protection, the field shifted focus to emerging data indicating a critical role for T cells in viral control [11]. This inspired the testing of a T cell-focused vaccine (adenovirus 5-Ad5) strategy.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein vaccines, also known as genetically engineered subunit vaccines, are generated by integrating the target genes of pathogenic microorganisms into a vector that is used to efficiently express antigen proteins in an unrelated industrial organism. The recombinant viral surface proteins are then injected directly into the body to induce an immune response (Fig. 3f ). The antigenicity of these vaccines is closely related to their expression systems. Currently, the expression systems used to produce this type of vaccine mainly include bacteria, yeasts, insect cells and mammalian cells. This type of vaccine, such as the SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein subunit vaccine, is directly taken up by antigen-presenting cells with strong inherent adjuvant activity. Thus, they efficiently induce adaptive immune responses mediated by T and B cells [59]. Since the first recombinant vaccine produced in yeast was marketed in the 1980s, recombinant protein vaccines have become popular and have been developed rapidly. The most representative recombinant protein vaccines include hepatitis B virus vaccine [217], hepatitis E virus vaccine [218] and human papilloma virus vaccine [219]. In addition, recombinant protein vaccines against herpes zoster virus [220], foot-and-mouth disease virus, influenza virus and MERS coronavirus [221] are also under extensive development. \n\nRecombinant protein vaccines have high intrinsic safety and excellent stability. Moreover, they can be produced on a very large scale, making them suitable for population-based vaccination campaigns. However, the shortcomings of recombinant protein vaccines, such as poor immunogenicity, limited immunization time, dependence on the time of immunization and adjuvant type, also result in challenges.",

The recombinant viruses expressing env in postion 2, or 3, and a recombinant virus expressing simultaneously env in position 2 and gag in position 3 were also used to immunize transgenic mice. Immune responses towards MV, and SIV-env were determined by ELISA. MV specific antibody responses induced by the standard MV vaccine or rMV-SIV were comparable up to 50 weeks post immunization (Fig. 4C). UV inactivated MV induced only marginal levels of antibody titers fading away very quickly, indicating that replication of MV or rMV is necessary to induce high and persisting immune reponses. For the three rMV-SIV vectors the initial induction of IgGs against SIV-env protein appeared very different at 8-20 weeks post immunization, but the antibody levels reached rather similar end points at 50-week post immunization (Fig. 4D). While very high early (8 weeks) anti-env antibody titers were induced by the double recombinant MV2,3env,gag-SIV, recombinant MV expressing env from position 3, MV3env-SIV, appeared to elicit the lowest initial anti-SIV-env antibody titer at week 8 post immunization. This is remarkable in view of the fact that the double recombinant grew to slightly lower titers than the other two recombinants (Fig. 4B). We observed that anti-SIV-env antibody titers remained rather high, declining only slowly after 20 weeks, similar to anti-MV antibodies. Therefore, the longevity of humoral immune response against foreign antigens appear to follow kinetics similar to those observed for the MV specific antibody response (Fig. 4D).",

The past 2 years have seen the emergence of several variants that were more vicious than each other. The emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529) proved to be a huge epidemiological concern as the rate of infection of this particular strain was enormous. The strain was identified in South Africa on November 24, 2021 and was classified as a \u201cVariant of Concern\u201d on November 26, 2021. The Omicron variant possessed mutations in the key RBD region, the S region, thereby increasing the affinity of ACE2 for better transmission of the virus. Antibody resistance was found in this variant and it was able to reduce vaccine efficiency of vaccines. The need for a booster vaccine was brought forth due to the prevalence of the Omicron variant and, subsequently, this led to targeted research and development of variant\u2010specific vaccines and booster dosage. This review discusses broadly the genomic characters and features of Omicron along with its specific mutations, evolution, antibody resistance, and evasion, utilization of CRISPR\u2010Cas12a assay for Omicron detection, T\u2010cell immunity elicited by vaccines against Omicron, and strategies to decrease Omicron infection along with COVID\u201019 and it also discusses on XE recombinant variant and on infectivity of BA.2 subvariant of Omicron.",

We also demonstrated that the long-term persistence of lung T RM cells is a consequence of local T-cell proliferation, rather than T-cell migration from lymph nodes.

PD-1 antibody immunotherapy helps a subset of cervical cancer patients, and its efficacy might be improved by combination with active vaccination against E6 and/or E7. ABSTRACT Immunotherapy for cervical cancer should target high-risk human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, which cause 50% and 20% of cervical cancers, respectively. Here, we describe the construction and characterization of the pBI-11 DNA vaccine via the addition of codon-optimized human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) E7 and HPV16 and 18 E6 genes to the HPV16 E7-targeted DNA vaccine pNGVL4a-SigE7(detox)HSP70 (DNA vaccine pBI-1). Codon optimization of the HPV16/18 E6/E7 genes in pBI-11 improved fusion protein expression compared to that in DNA vaccine pBI-10.1 that utilized the native viral sequences fused 3\u2032 to a signal sequence and 5\u2032 to the HSP70 gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Intramuscular vaccination of mice with pBI-11 DNA better induced HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses than pBI-10.1 DNA. Furthermore, intramuscular vaccination with pBI-11 DNA generated stronger therapeutic responses for C57BL/6 mice bearing HPV16 E6/E7-expressing TC-1 tumors. The HPV16/18 antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune responses generated by pBI-11 DNA vaccination were further enhanced by boosting with tissue-antigen HPV vaccine (TA-HPV). Combination of the pBI-11 DNA and TA-HPV boost vaccination with PD-1 antibody blockade significantly improved the control of TC-1 tumors and extended the survival of the mice. Finally, repeat vaccination with clinical-grade pBI-11 with or without clinical-grade TA-HPV was well tolerated in vaccinated mice. These preclinical studies suggest that the pBI-11 DNA vaccine may be used with TA-HPV in a heterologous prime-boost strategy to enhance HPV 16/18 E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses, either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade, to control HPV16/18-associated tumors. Our data serve as an important foundation for future clinical translation.

PD-1 antibody immunotherapy helps a subset of cervical cancer patients, and its efficacy might be improved by combination with active vaccination against E6 and/or E7. For patients with HPV16+ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN2/3), the precursor of cervical cancer, intramuscular vaccination with a DNA vaccine targeting HPV16 E7 and then a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HPV16/18 E6-E7 fusion proteins (TA-HPV) was safe, and half of the patients cleared their lesions in a small study (NCT00788164). Here, we sought to improve upon this therapeutic approach by developing a new DNA vaccine that targets E6 and E7 of HPV16 and HPV18 for administration prior to a TA-HPV booster vaccination and for application against cervical cancer in combination with a PD-1-blocking antibody.",

The surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV, which binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is considered as a major target for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Here, we designed recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the N-terminal domain (rAd/NTD) and receptor-binding domain (rAd/RBD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit and full-length Spike protein (rAd/Spike). We found that immunization with candidate vaccines via intranasal route induced S1-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against MERS spike pseudotyped virus. Especially, rAd/Spike induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and the strongest cytokine-induced T cell responses among the three candidate vaccines. To compare the immune responses induced by different administration routes, rAd/Spike was administered via intranasal, sublingual, or intramuscular route. All these administration routes exhibited neutralizing effects in the serum. MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing IgA antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were only induced by intranasal and sublingual administration but not by intramuscular administration. Intranasal administration with rAd/Spike also created resident memory CD8 T cells in the airway and lung parenchyma. Taken together, our results showed that both the humoral and cellular immune responses are highly induced by rAd/Spike administration, suggesting that rAd/Spike may confer protection against MERS-CoV infection.",

The rearing of fish at high population densities in aquaculture facilities makes them highly susceptible to disease outbreaks, which can cause significant economic loss. Thus, immunity development in fish through vaccination against various pathogens of economically important aquaculture species has been extensively studied and has been largely accepted as a reliable method for preventing infections. Vaccination studies in aquaculture systems are strategically associated with the economically and environmentally sustainable management of aquaculture production worldwide. Historically, most licensed fish vaccines have been developed as inactivated pathogens combined with adjuvants and provided via immersion or injection. In comparison, live vaccines can simulate a whole pathogenic illness and elicit a strong immune response, making them better suited for oral or immersion-based therapy methods to control diseases. Advanced approaches in vaccine development involve targeting specific pathogenic components, including the use of recombinant genes and proteins. Vaccines produced using these techniques, some of which are currently commercially available, appear to elicit and promote higher levels of immunity than conventional fish vaccines. These technological advancements are promising for developing sustainable production processes for commercially important aquatic species. In this review, we explore the multitude of studies on fish bacterial pathogens undertaken in the last decade as well as the recent advances in vaccine development for aquaculture.",

Currently, Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against immune checkpoints have shown good efficacy for tumor treatment. In this study, we constructed an immune single-chain fragment variable (scFv) library using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 200 patients with a variety of malignant tumors. High affinity scFvs against EphA2 can be easily screened from the immune library using phage display technology. Anti-EphA2 scFvs can be modified into any form of recombinant antibody, including scFv-Fc and full-length IgG1 antibodies, and the recombinant antibody affinity was improved following modification. Among the modified anti-EphA2 antibodies the affinity of 77-IgG1 was significantly increased, reaching a pmol affinity level (10\u221212). We further demonstrated the binding activity of recombinant antibodies to the EphA2 protein, tumor cells, and tumor tissues using macromolecular interaction techniques, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Most importantly, both the constructed scFvs-Fc, as well as the IgG1 antibodies against EphA2 were able to inhibit the growth of tumor cells to some extent. These results suggest that the immune libraries from patients with malignant tumors are more likely to screen for antibodies with high affinity and therapeutic effect. The constructed fully human scFv immune library has broad application prospects for specific antibody screening. The screened scFv-Fc and IgG1 antibodies against EphA2 can be used for the further study of tumor immunotherapy. Graphical abstract",

We provide an in-depth description of humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses by age (protocol-defined) or underlying disease (post-hoc) as well as efficacy by underlying disease (post-hoc) of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in a randomized observer-blind phase III trial (ZOE-HSCT, NCT01610414). 1846 adult auHSCT recipients were randomized to receive a first dose of either RZV or placebo 50\u201370 days post-auHSCT, followed by the second dose at 1\u20132 months (M) later. In cohorts of 114\u20131721 participants, at 1 M post-second vaccine dose: Anti-gE antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and median gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cell frequencies (CD4 T cells expressing \u22652 of four assessed activation markers) were similar between 18\u201349 and \u226550-year-olds. Despite lower anti-gE antibody GMCs in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL) patients, CD4[2+] T-cell frequencies were similar between NHBCL and other underlying diseases. The proportion of polyfunctional CD4 T cells increased over time, accounting for 79.6% of gE-specific CD4 T cells at 24 M post-dose two. Vaccine efficacy against HZ ranged between 42.5% and 82.5% across underlying diseases and was statistically significant in NHBCL and multiple myeloma patients. In conclusion, two RZV doses administered early post-auHSCT induced robust, persistent, and polyfunctional gE-specific immune responses. Efficacy against HZ was also high in NHBCL patients despite the lower humoral response. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the context? After haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, patients have impaired immunity from conditioning chemotherapy regimens, often exacerbated by underlying diseases, putting them at high risk of developing herpes zoster. In this population, antiviral prophylaxis is the current standard of care to reduce herpes zoster risk. Vaccination provides an additional means to prevent herpes zoster. Live-attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated in immunocompromised patients. A non-live, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix, GSK), has been approved for use in adults \u226550 years of age in the European Union, United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and China. This vaccine is highly efficacious at preventing herpes zoster in adults over 50 years of age, as demonstrated in large, placebo-controlled randomised trials. Importantly, Shingrix use is not contraindicated in immunocompromised conditions, and was found to be highly efficacious in adults who had recently undergone autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant. What is new? In autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients in whom Shingrix has demonstrated efficacy, two doses elicited high and persistent immune responses. Date presented here further support our understanding of the impact of specific factors such as age or underlying diseases on the vaccine\u2019s effect in the population studied, as well as the characteristics of the elicited cell-mediated immune responses. What is the impact? These results indicate that Shingrix, given shortly after haematopoietic stem cell transplant, can induce robust immune responses and reduce the risk of herpes zoster, even in individuals with immunosuppression due to underlying disease and/or use of immunosuppressive therapies, regardless of age or underlying disease.",

Individuals with MBL/untreated CLL and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)\u2010treated CLL patients were given two doses of RZV separated by 2\u2009months. Responses assessed at 3 and 12\u2009months from the first dose of RZV by an anti\u2010glycoprotein E ELISA antibody assay and by dual\u2010color Interferon\u2010\u03b3 and Interleukin\u20102FLUOROSPOT assays were compared to historic controls matched by age and sex. About 62 patients (37 MBL/untreated CLL and 25 BTKi\u2010treated CLL) were enrolled with a median age of 68\u2009years at vaccination. An antibody response at 3\u2009months was seen in 45% of participants, which was significantly lower compared to historic controls (63%, p =\u2009.03). The antibody response did not significantly differ between MBL/untreated CLL and BTKi\u2010treated CLL (51% vs. 36%, respectively, p =\u2009.23). The CD4+ T\u2010cell response to vaccination was significantly lower in study participants compared to controls (54% vs. 96%, p <\u2009.001), mainly due to lower responses among BTKi\u2010treated patients compared to untreated MBL/CLL (32% vs. 73%, p =\u2009.008). Overall, only 29% of participants achieved combined antibody and cellular responses to RZV. Among participants with response assessment at 12\u2009months (n =\u200947), 24% had antibody titers below the response threshold.

Limitations of these polysaccharide vaccines, such as partial coverage and induced escape leading to persistence of disease, provide a compelling argument for the development of protein vaccines.

As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation.

Furthermore, they do not solely represent a substitute for monoclonal antibodies but their unique features allow expanding the applications of biotherapeutics and changes the pattern of disease treatment. Nanobodies possess the double advantage of being small and simple to engineer. This combination has promoted extremely diversified approaches to design nanobody-based constructs suitable for particular applications. Both the format geometry possibilities and the functionalization strategies have been widely explored to provide macromolecules with better efficacy with respect to single nanobodies or their combination. Nanobody multimers and nanobody-derived reagents were developed to image and contrast several cancer diseases and have shown their effectiveness in animal models. Their capacity to block more independent signaling pathways simultaneously is considered a critical advantage to avoid tumor resistance, whereas the mass of these multimeric compounds still remains significantly smaller than that of an IgG, enabling deeper penetration in solid tumors. When applied to CAR-T cell therapy, nanobodies can effectively improve the specificity by targeting multiple epitopes and consequently reduce the side effects. This represents a great potential in treating malignant lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Apart from cancer treatment, multispecific drugs and imaging reagents built with nanobody blocks have demonstrated their value also for detecting and tackling neurodegenerative, autoimmune, metabolic, and infectious diseases and as antidotes for toxins. In particular, multi-paratopic nanobody-based constructs have been developed recently as drugs for passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with the goal of impairing variant survival due to resistance to antibodies targeting single epitopes. Given the enormous research activity in the field, it can be expected that more and more multimeric nanobody molecules will undergo late clinical trials in the next future.

Despite the research in therapeutics, the prognosis is dismal. Malignant glioma stem cells (MGSCs) are a major cause of treatment failure and increasing tumor recurrence. In general, cancer stem cells (CSCs) express prominin-1 (CD133), considered as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we produced an avian immunotoxin directed against the subpopulation of CD133+ CSCs within a malignant glioma. We used the avian IgY because it has various advantages as increased affinity to mammal antigens and inexpensive obtention of large amounts of specific antibodies (approximately 1 mg/per egg). The design, production, purification and use of IgY anti CD133 immunotoxin constitute an original goal of this research. Methods The immunodominant peptide of CD133 was designed to immunize hens; also, the extracellular domain of CD133 was cloned to probe the IgY antibodies. In parallel, a recombinant abrin A chain was produced in E. coli in order to join it to the Fc domain of the anti-CD133 IgY to conform the immunotoxin. This anti-CD133 IgY anti-tumor immunotoxin was tested in vitro and in vivo. Results. The cytotoxicity of the immunotoxin in vitro showed that IgY-abrin immunotoxin reduced 55% cell viability. After subcutaneous MGSCs implantation, the animals treated intraperitoneally or intratumorally with the IgY-abrin immunotoxin showed more than 50% decrease of tumor volume. Conclusion Results showed that the IgY-abrin immunotoxin had cytotoxic activity against CD133+ MGSCs and provides a novel approach for the immunotherapy of glioblastoma.",

IgYs have been applied to various fields of medicine and biotechnology. The present article will deal with specific aspects of IgY technology, focusing on the currently reported methods for developing, isolating, evaluating and storing polyclonal IgYs. Other topics such as current information on isolation protocols or evaluation of IgYs from different avian species are also discussed. Specific advantages of IgY technology (e.g., novel antibody specificities that may emerge via the avian immune system) will also be discussed. Recent in vitro applications of polyclonal egg yolk-derived IgYs to the field of disease diagnosis in human and veterinary medicine through in vitro immunodetection of target biomolecules will be presented. Moreover, ethical aspects associated with animal well-being as well as new promising approaches that are relevant to the original IgY technology (e.g., development of monoclonal IgYs and IgY-like antibodies through the phage display technique or in transgenic chickens) and future prospects in the area will also be mentioned."

This question is also relevant for therapeutic antibody design. Antibody Fab and Fc domains are connected by flexible unstructured hinge region. Fc chains have conserved glycosylation sites at Asn297, with each conjugated to a core heptasaccharide and forming biantennary Fc glycan. The glycans modulate the Fc conformations and functions. It is well known that the antibody Fab and Fc domains and glycan affect antibody activity, but whether these elements act independently or synergistically is still uncertain. We simulated four antibody complexes: free antibody, antigen-bound antibody, FcR-bound antibody, and an antigen-antibody-FcR complex. We found that, in the antibody\u2019s \u201cT/Y\u201d conformation, the glycans, and the Fc domain all respond to antigen binding, with the antibody population shifting to two dominant clusters, both with the Fc-receptor binding site open. The simulations reveal that the Fc-glycan-receptor complexes also segregate into two conformational clusters, one corresponding to the antigen-free antibody-FcR baseline binding, and the other with an antigen-enhanced antibody-FcR interaction. Our study confirmed allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and following FcR activation. Even though we observed allosteric communications through the IgG domains, the most important mechanism that we observed is the communication via population shift, stimulated by antigen binding and propagating to influence FcR recognition.",

The US Centers for Disease Control identifies Ebola and Marburg viruses as 'category A' pathogens (defined as posing a risk to national security as bioterrorism agents), which has lead to a search for vaccines that could prevent the disease. Because the use of such vaccines would be in the service of public health, the cost of production is an important component of their development. The use of plant biotechnology is one possible way to cost-effectively produce subunit vaccines. In this work, a geminiviral replicon system was used to produce an Ebola immune complex (EIC) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Ebola glycoprotein (GP1) was fused at the C-terminus of the heavy chain of humanized 6D8 IgG monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to a linear epitope on GP1. Co-expression of the GP1-heavy chain fusion and the 6D8 light chain using a geminiviral vector in leaves of N.\u00a0benthamiana produced assembled immunoglobulin, which was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography. Immune complex formation was confirmed by assays to show that the recombinant protein bound the complement factor C1q. Size measurements of purified recombinant protein by dynamic light scattering and size-exclusion chromatography also indicated complex formation. Subcutaneous immunization of BALB/C mice with purified EIC resulted in anti-Ebola virus antibody production at levels comparable to those obtained with a GP1 virus-like particle. These results show excellent potential for a plant-expressed EIC as a human vaccine."

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics.",
                    "[21756288 | Ross et al. | 2003 | Citations: 49]": "The recent clinical and commercial success of anticancer antibodies such as rituximab and trastuzumab has created great interest in antibody-based therapeutics for hematopoietic malignant neoplasms and solid tumors. Given the likelihood of lower toxic effects of antibodies that target tumor cells and have limited impact on nonmalignant bystander organs vs small molecules, the potential increased efficacy by conjugation to radioisotopes and other cellular toxins, and the ability to characterize the target with clinical laboratory diagnostics to improve the drug's clinical performance, current and future antibody therapeutics are likely to find substantial roles alone and in combination therapeutic strategies for treating patients with cancer. It also is likely that conjugation strategies will add new radiolabeled and toxin-linked products to the market to complement the recent approvals of ibritumomab tiuxetan and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. This review considers the structure of anticancer therapeutic antibodies and the techniques used to reduce their antigenicity. Efficacy and toxic effects, conjugation with isotopes and toxins, and validation of the antibody targets also are discussed. Antibodies approved by the Food and Drug Administration are described in detail, as are antibodies in late and early stages of clinical development.",

Fourteen different protein antigens were used to affinity select antibodies from this library. A panel of specific antibodies was isolated with each antigen, and each panel contained an average of 8.7 different scFv. Measurements of antibody-antigen interactions revealed several affinities below 1 nM, comparable to affinities observed during the secondary murine immune response. In particular, four different scFv recognizing the ErbB2 protein had affinities ranging from 220 pM to 4 nM. Antibodies derived from the library proved to be useful reagents for immunoassays. For example, antibodies generated to the Chlamydia trachomatis elementary bodies stained Chlamydia-infected cells, but not uninfected cells. These results demonstrate that phage antibody libraries are ideally suited for the rapid production of panels of high-affinity mAbs to a wide variety of protein antigens. Such libraries should prove especially useful for generating reagents to study the function of gene products identified by genome projects.",
                    "[25796417 | Thompson et al. | 1996 | Citations: 110]": "The present study set out to investigate whether phage display could be used to improve the properties of a high-affinity human monoclonal antibody directed against the third hypervariable loop (V3 loop) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim was to increase affinity through slowing the dissociation rate (off-rate constant of koff), whilst retaining the ability of this antibody to bind diverse V3 loop sequences. When reformatted as a scFv, the antibody fragment retained the properties of the parental IgG, including the ability to neutralise virus. Heavy and light chains were sequentially replaced with repertoires of variable domains from non-immunised human donors followed by selection on biotinylated synthetic peptide. All selected variants derived from the same germline as the parental antibody. Variants of the light chain provided little if any improvement, whereas two residue changes in VHCDR2 and one in VHFR3 resulted in a reduced koff from gp120 protein of the MN strain (MNgp120) and synthetic V3 loop peptides as measured by surface plasmon resonance using the BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor). VHCDR3 was modified using synthetic oligonucleotides and several clones with reduced koff identified, a number of different substitutions occurring at a single residue position. The residues in the heavy chain identified as reducing koff were simultaneously randomised by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in scFv variants with koff slowed up to sevenfold. Far from compromising recognition of variant loops, binding to these sequences was improved; the koff from synthetic peptides modelled on V3 loop variants being slowed to a degree similar to that observed with MNgp120. All four changes were located towards either extremes of CDRs 2 and 3, suggesting that the mechanism of improvement may be one of alternation of loop conformation. This work illustrates that phage display can be used to tailor the properties of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in a predefined fashion.",

Traditional antibody production relied on immunizing animals and collecting polyclonal antibodies from their serum or creating hybridomas for monoclonal antibody production. In contrast, recombinant technology uses molecular biology techniques to manipulate antibody genes directly, allowing scientists to clone, modify, and express antibody genes in various host systems. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe foundation of this technology lies in understanding antibody structure - typically consisting of two heavy and two light chains with variable regions that determine antigen specificity. By isolating and manipulating the genes encoding these regions, scientists can create antibodies with customized binding properties, increased stability, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced effector functions. This genetic engineering approach has overcome many limitations of conventional antibody production methods. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nSince the 1980s, recombinant antibody technology has evolved rapidly, with key developments including the creation of chimeric antibodies (combining human constant regions with mouse variable regions), humanized antibodies (with only the complementarity-determining regions from mouse sources), and fully human antibodies. These innovations significantly reduced the immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies while maintaining their specificity and efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe integration of this technology with vaccine development and immunotherapy has been transformative.

                            "The present study set out to investigate whether phage display could be used to improve the properties of a high-affinity human monoclonal antibody directed against the third hypervariable loop (V3 loop) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim was to increase affinity through slowing the dissociation rate (off-rate constant of koff), whilst retaining the ability of this antibody to bind diverse V3 loop sequences. When reformatted as a scFv, the antibody fragment retained the properties of the parental IgG, including the ability to neutralise virus. Heavy and light chains were sequentially replaced with repertoires of variable domains from non-immunised human donors followed by selection on biotinylated synthetic peptide. All selected variants derived from the same germline as the parental antibody. Variants of the light chain provided little if any improvement, whereas two residue changes in VHCDR2 and one in VHFR3 resulted in a reduced koff from gp120 protein of the MN strain (MNgp120) and synthetic V3 loop peptides as measured by surface plasmon resonance using the BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor). VHCDR3 was modified using synthetic oligonucleotides and several clones with reduced koff identified, a number of different substitutions occurring at a single residue position. The residues in the heavy chain identified as reducing koff were simultaneously randomised by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in scFv variants with koff slowed up to sevenfold. Far from compromising recognition of variant loops, binding to these sequences was improved; the koff from synthetic peptides modelled on V3 loop variants being slowed to a degree similar to that observed with MNgp120. All four changes were located towards either extremes of CDRs 2 and 3, suggesting that the mechanism of improvement may be one of alternation of loop conformation. This work illustrates that phage display can be used to tailor the properties of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in a predefined fashion."

Antibody generation has been dramatically accelerated by in vitro selection systems, particularly phage display. An increasing variety of recombinant production systems have been developed, ranging from Gram-negative and positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines, mammalian cells to transgenic plants and animals. Currently, almost all therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity due to altered, non-human glycosylation patterns. However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with \"human-like\" post-translational modifications. Furthermore, smaller antibody fragments including bispecific antibodies without any glycosylation are successfully produced in bacteria and have advanced to clinical testing. The first therapeutic antibody products from a non-mammalian source can be expected in coming next years."

The genetic manipulation of recombinant antibodies thus improved our understanding about the structure and functional organization of immunoglobulins. Further, these advances have led the development of a large variety of engineered antibody molecules for research, diagnosis, and therapy with specificities out of reach of conventional antibody technology. Once cloned, it is then possible to increase the affinity and specificity of antigen binding by mimicking somatic hypermutation during an immune response [6]. It may even be possible to replace the existing practices of animal immunization and hybridoma development through a bacterial system capable of synthesizing and expressing practically unlimited quantities of antibodies to almost any antigen."

Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed."

Enhanced by high-throughput technologies, this approach allows for screening large numbers of antibody-secreting cells, advancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions <Paper corpusId=\"226987684\" paperTitle=\"(Vrancianu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe technology has also enabled the development of DNA vaccines with the potential to generate human antibodies. This possibility is enhanced by humanized recombinant animal systems capable of producing nearly-human antibodies and by direct cloning of human immunoglobulin chains from antigen-specific B cells after vaccination. Such approaches circumvent potential reactogenicity issues associated with antibodies produced in other species <Paper corpusId=\"1317986\" paperTitle=\"(Golden et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother promising application involves the creation of recombinant immune complexes (ICs) by fusing antigens with the Fc fragment of IgG into a single molecule. This experimental approach has been tested using plant biotechnology with encouraging results in animal models <Paper corpusId=\"58014963\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8799391\" paperTitle=\"(Phoolcharoen et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. Recent studies on allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and Fc receptor activation suggest possibilities for developing even more effective immune complex constructs <Paper corpusId=\"52274413\" paperTitle=\"(Zhao et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe genomic revolution has significantly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens suitable as targets for neutralizing antibodies. These antigens often play crucial roles in pathogen life cycles, opening perspectives not only for vaccine development but also for creating monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections as alternative treatment options when vaccination and antibiotics are not viable <Paper corpusId=\"44020703\" paperTitle=\"(Giefing et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Advances in gene-based delivery technology, initially developed for gene therapy, have further revitalized vaccine development by improving methods for producing recombinant gene products for both protein- and gene-based vaccines <Paper corpusId=\"3022819\" paperTitle=\"(Nabel, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Development of an effective vaccine is of paramount important in disease prevention and control. As such, recombinant technology can serve as a gateway for the development of safe and effective vaccines that can be delivered effectively with an appropriate adjuvant. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the role of recombinant vaccine technology, new adjuvants and the challenge of vaccine delivery. Related peer-reviewed journal article searches were conducted using a subscribed database at the Universiti Putra Malaysia library, involving areas of Health Sciences and Medicine via Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. New generation vaccines include highly purified synthetic or recombinant antigens that stimulate effective cell-mediated immune and mucosal immunity. In order to enhance their efficacy, a number of adjuvants are used. Efforts have also been made to explore the usage of non-invasive routes of administration, devices and equipment for optimized antigen and immune-potentiator delivery of the immune system. Recombinant vaccine technology is rapid, compared to the traditional method of vaccine development and does not require the handling of live viruses. It is, therefore, a promising technology for developing a future vaccine to curb emerging and re-emerging viral infections that may be life-threatening or teratogenic."

This new approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0), relies on the isolation and recombinant expression of the variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chain genes of immunoglobulin (focus has centered on IgG) using a variety of molecular tools (Bidmos et al., 2018). Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity. Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens. Growing knowledge in this field could lead to the rational design of new antigens more stable and elicit a high level of functional antibodies."

Polysaccharide-based vaccines have provided a degree of success in limiting morbidity from disseminated bacterial infections, including those caused by the major human obligate pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of these polysaccharide vaccines, such as partial coverage and induced escape leading to persistence of disease, provide a compelling argument for the development of protein vaccines. In this review, we briefly chronicle approaches that have yielded licensed vaccines before highlighting reverse vaccinology 2.0 and its potential application in the discovery of novel bacterial protein vaccine candidates.

Such antibodies would circumvent potential reactogenicity of antibodies made in other species. The extent by which DNA vaccine technology can be used to develop immunotherapeutics against infectious agents, including biological threat agents for which neither immune sera produced using licensed vaccines nor convalescent sera/plasma are available, is a matter for future exploration."

                            "Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) cause severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. The US Centers for Disease Control identifies Ebola and Marburg viruses as 'category A' pathogens (defined as posing a risk to national security as bioterrorism agents), which has lead to a search for vaccines that could prevent the disease. Because the use of such vaccines would be in the service of public health, the cost of production is an important component of their development. The use of plant biotechnology is one possible way to cost-effectively produce subunit vaccines. In this work, a geminiviral replicon system was used to produce an Ebola immune complex (EIC) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Ebola glycoprotein (GP1) was fused at the C-terminus of the heavy chain of humanized 6D8 IgG monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to a linear epitope on GP1. Co-expression of the GP1-heavy chain fusion and the 6D8 light chain using a geminiviral vector in leaves of N.\u00a0benthamiana produced assembled immunoglobulin, which was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography. Immune complex formation was confirmed by assays to show that the recombinant protein bound the complement factor C1q. Size measurements of purified recombinant protein by dynamic light scattering and size-exclusion chromatography also indicated complex formation. Subcutaneous immunization of BALB/C mice with purified EIC resulted in anti-Ebola virus antibody production at levels comparable to those obtained with a GP1 virus-like particle. These results show excellent potential for a plant-expressed EIC as a human vaccine."

                            "ABSTRACT A key question in immunology is whether antigen recognition and Fc receptor (FcR) binding are allosterically linked. This question is also relevant for therapeutic antibody design. Antibody Fab and Fc domains are connected by flexible unstructured hinge region. Fc chains have conserved glycosylation sites at Asn297, with each conjugated to a core heptasaccharide and forming biantennary Fc glycan. The glycans modulate the Fc conformations and functions. It is well known that the antibody Fab and Fc domains and glycan affect antibody activity, but whether these elements act independently or synergistically is still uncertain. We simulated four antibody complexes: free antibody, antigen-bound antibody, FcR-bound antibody, and an antigen-antibody-FcR complex. We found that, in the antibody\u2019s \"T/Y\" conformation, the glycans, and the Fc domain all respond to antigen binding, with the antibody population shifting to two dominant clusters, both with the Fc-receptor binding site open. The simulations reveal that the Fc-glycan-receptor complexes also segregate into two conformational clusters, one corresponding to the antigen-free antibody-FcR baseline binding, and the other with an antigen-enhanced antibody-FcR interaction. Our study confirmed allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and following FcR activation. Even though we observed allosteric communications through the IgG domains, the most important mechanism that we observed is the communication via population shift, stimulated by antigen binding and propagating to influence FcR recognition."

                            "Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe's life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy."

Since the 1980s, immunostimulants like IFN-\u03b1 were among the first recombinant products that nonspecifically boosted the immune system to attack cancer cells. Interleukins such as IL-2 have also found application as adjuvants in cancer vaccines to enhance immune responses. However, it is the various formats of antibodies and their fragments that have come to dominate the market due to their high specificity and favorable clinical outcomes, whether used alone or in combination with drugs, toxins, or radionuclides. <Paper corpusId=\"21921069\" paperTitle=\"(Pranchevicius et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe past decade has witnessed antibodies and other recombinant proteins dominating the pharmaceutical industry, with seven of the top ten selling drugs in the US in 2018 being engineered proteins. The field is rapidly evolving beyond conventional monoclonal antibodies toward more sophisticated constructs. A notable example is the FDA approval of blinatumomab in 2014, a bispecific antibody targeting both CD3 and CD19 for treating relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Immunostimulants, such as IFN-\u03b1, were the first recombinant products that nonspecifically boosted the immune system to attack cancer cells. In addition to individual use, IL-2, for instance, is being employed as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines to increase the immune response.

An increasing variety of recombinant production systems have been developed, ranging from Gram-negative and positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines, mammalian cells to transgenic plants and animals. Currently, almost all therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity due to altered, non-human glycosylation patterns. However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with \"human-like\" post-translational modifications.

                            "Recombinant antibodies such as nanobodies are progressively demonstrating to be a valid alternative to conventional monoclonal antibodies also for clinical applications. Furthermore, they do not solely represent a substitute for monoclonal antibodies but their unique features allow expanding the applications of biotherapeutics and changes the pattern of disease treatment. Nanobodies possess the double advantage of being small and simple to engineer. This combination has promoted extremely diversified approaches to design nanobody-based constructs suitable for particular applications. Both the format geometry possibilities and the functionalization strategies have been widely explored to provide macromolecules with better efficacy with respect to single nanobodies or their combination. Nanobody multimers and nanobody-derived reagents were developed to image and contrast several cancer diseases and have shown their effectiveness in animal models. Their capacity to block more independent signaling pathways simultaneously is considered a critical advantage to avoid tumor resistance, whereas the mass of these multimeric compounds still remains significantly smaller than that of an IgG, enabling deeper penetration in solid tumors. When applied to CAR-T cell therapy, nanobodies can effectively improve the specificity by targeting multiple epitopes and consequently reduce the side effects. This represents a great potential in treating malignant lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Apart from cancer treatment, multispecific drugs and imaging reagents built with nanobody blocks have demonstrated their value also for detecting and tackling neurodegenerative, autoimmune, metabolic, and infectious diseases and as antidotes for toxins. In particular, multi-paratopic nanobody-based constructs have been developed recently as drugs for passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with the goal of impairing variant survival due to resistance to antibodies targeting single epitopes. Given the enormous research activity in the field, it can be expected that more and more multimeric nanobody molecules will undergo late clinical trials in the next future.
