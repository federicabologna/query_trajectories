On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies.

                    "text": "Currently, nucleic acids-based therapies are of immense clinical value due to their vast potential. LNPs have made significant progress in the field of targeted delivery of nucleic acids, but they also face certain challenges. Therefore, reasonable design of LNPs in the future will help overcome these difficulties. \n\n(1) Although LNP therapies generally exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to conventional chemotherapy and protein therapy, they are not immune to potential toxicity arising from the accumulation of LNPs in the liver and spleen. The presence of PEG chains in LNPs is beneficial in reducing toxic side effects and increasing their circulation time in vivo. Keeping a reasonable balance between the proportion of PEGylated lipids and PEG chain length in LNPs may mitigate their toxicity. (2) Traditional LNPs possess inherent passive targeting properties that predominantly guide them to hepatocytes, leading to accumulation in the liver and spleen. There is an urgent need to develop LNPs tailored to deliver nucleic acids to other organs. Screening and optimizing selective ILs or implementing chemical and biological modifications will enhance the targeting of specific organs. In addition, by exploring structure-activity relationships and chemical synthesis, more ILs for extrahepatic and extrasplenic targeting could be obtained. (3) The relationship between LNPs components and the types of protein corona formed on their surface needs to be further studied. Constructing and screening a predictable library is essential, validating the structure-activity relationship of lipids, and proteomics is anticipated to provide insights for the design of organ-selective LNPs. (4) The organ-selective delivery of LNPs faces the common challenge of being time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emerging use of DNA or mRNA barcodes holds the potential to enable high-throughput in vivo screening to address this issue. (5) The current pharmacokinetic studies of LNPs are not without flaws, and the use of LNPs may induce immune responses, which can limit their long-term usage. Continuous drug safety assessment and optimization are necessary to ensure the reliability and safety of LNPs in clinical applications.",

                    "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.\n\n## Liver-selective LNPs\nIn the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42\n\n## DELIVERY MECHANISMS OF ORGAN-SELECTIVE LNPs IN VIVO\nChanges in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation.

LNPs have made significant progress in the field of targeted delivery of nucleic acids, but they also face certain challenges. Therefore, reasonable design of LNPs in the future will help overcome these difficulties. \n\n(1) Although LNP therapies generally exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to conventional chemotherapy and protein therapy, they are not immune to potential toxicity arising from the accumulation of LNPs in the liver and spleen. The presence of PEG chains in LNPs is beneficial in reducing toxic side effects and increasing their circulation time in vivo. Keeping a reasonable balance between the proportion of PEGylated lipids and PEG chain length in LNPs may mitigate their toxicity. (2) Traditional LNPs possess inherent passive targeting properties that predominantly guide them to hepatocytes, leading to accumulation in the liver and spleen. There is an urgent need to develop LNPs tailored to deliver nucleic acids to other organs. Screening and optimizing selective ILs or implementing chemical and biological modifications will enhance the targeting of specific organs. In addition, by exploring structure-activity relationships and chemical synthesis, more ILs for extrahepatic and extrasplenic targeting could be obtained. (3) The relationship between LNPs components and the types of protein corona formed on their surface needs to be further studied. Constructing and screening a predictable library is essential, validating the structure-activity relationship of lipids, and proteomics is anticipated to provide insights for the design of organ-selective LNPs. (4) The organ-selective delivery of LNPs faces the common challenge of being time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emerging use of DNA or mRNA barcodes holds the potential to enable high-throughput in vivo screening to address this issue. (5) The current pharmacokinetic studies of LNPs are not without flaws, and the use of LNPs may induce immune responses, which can limit their long-term usage. Continuous drug safety assessment and optimization are necessary to ensure the reliability and safety of LNPs in clinical applications.",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

                    "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

                    "text": "Unexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.",

S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).\n...\nUnexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.\n...\nSince extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose. In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

Several 111 In-labeled RLPs derivatized with varying amounts of RGD and PEG building blocks were prepared to investigate their performance in vitro and in vivo using biodistribution experiments and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies.\n\nUntil now, research on both in vivo and in vitro properties of targeted liposomes has been limited and concentrated on different targeting moieties. 38,39 Previous studies have described the influence of PEG loading on targeting properties in vivo; 7 therefore, it was decided to investigate this behavior in vitro with RLPs carrying varying amounts of PEG. In vitro binding to isolated \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin receptors revealed the highest binding when no PEG building block was used ( Figure 3) and binding decreased with higher PEG loading of the RLPs. Given the fact that Torchilin et al showed that higher PEG loading (10 mol%) of immunoliposomes caused steric hindrance and resulted in lower accumulation in the target tissue in vivo, the same phenomena might well occur in vitro. 40 On the other hand, PEGylation is advantageous when using LNPs in vivo as it prolongs their circulation time and reduces    Concerning the effect of peptide loading of liposomes, initial studies with a tyrosine-3-octreotide peptide attached to LNPs have already been performed by the authors' group with promising results. 22 Based on these findings, the different RLPs were evaluated with respect to their RGD loading. In the competition assay, the half-maximal inhibitory values of the RLPs showed a clear relationship between RGD loading and replacement of 125 I-cyclo-(-",

            "text": "One major challenge is how to translate the in vitro performance of LNP formulations into in-vivo efficacy. The efficacy disparity between in vitro and in-vivo experiments was considered to be related to the formation of serum protein corona and anti-PEG antibodies on LNPs in vivo, which activated the host immune systems. 100,101 The pH discordance between the lab and in-vivo environment also contributed to the efficacy disparity. 102 Moreover, the heterogeneity of cancer cells and the TME in liver metastasis would limit the targeting ability of active targeting LNPs in vivo. 103 nother challenge remaining for active-targeting LNPs was the choice of targeting ligands. For instance, GA has been widely used as a ligand for liver-targeting LNPs. 92 However, it has been reported that GA would interfere with the drug metabolism process by modulating the enzymic activity of several CYP450 isoforms, which may lead to drug safety concerns. 104 Excessive GA uptake was also found to correlate with pseudo-hyperaldosteronism, which was characterized by severe hypertension and hypokalemia. 105 The example of GA reminded the importance of exploiting the physiological function of common targeting ligands in LNPs. \n\nFinally, the efficacy of LNP-based in clinical trials might be confounded by the anti-tumor effect of drug-free liposomes. In that, future clinical trials should incorporate an extra controlled group with drug-free liposomes to better evaluate the exact effectiveness of LNP-based formulations.",

            "text": "LNPs loaded with non-PEGylated mRNA formed aggregates immediately after the injection, leading to rapid clearance of the LNPs from the blood circulation. Notably, the non-PEGylated LNPs were deposited in the lung tissues, indicating the occlusion of lung capillary by the aggregates. Importantly, such lung embolism can cause the death of mice [26]. On the other hand, LNP PEGylation through PEG-OligoRNA hybridization to mRNA is effective in preventing LNP aggregation in the blood, and LNP deposition in the lung, demonstrating high structural stability of the LNPs in biological milieu and their improved safety for in vivo usage. Such structural stabilization after PEGylation may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force preventing the association of LNP with surrounding proteins, blood cells or LNPs in the blood [30]. \n\nThe mRNA introduction efficiency to the cultured cells decreased after LNP PEGylation, which may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force inhibiting the non-specific interaction of LNPs to cells and LNP uptake to the cells (Figure 7). The PEGylation of the LNPs can also induce inhibitory effect on intracellular processes, such as endosomal escape [31]. Several strategies were reported for solving these issues of PEGylation, so called \"PEG dilemma\", and facilitating cellular uptake and endosomal escape, including the installation of ligands to PEG, the optimization of surface PEG density and the selective cleavage of PEG in target tissues or cells [32][33][34][35][36]. We plan combinational use of these strategies with the mRNA PEGylation approach, to achieve efficient in vivo mRNA introduction in the future study. \n\nThe use of PEGylated lipids is an alternative strategy to prevent the aggregation after mRNA addition to LNPs, and feasibility of this strategy was well studied in LNP preparation for pDNA delivery. Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38].",

            "text": "EGFR is reported to be widely expressed (e.g. liver and kidney) [47,48], and hence the higher kidney uptake could be due to receptor mediated binding of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 NP, which would be expected to increase due to the reduction in non-specific uptake by MPS. Targeting ligands have often been conjugated to the distal end of PEG, to ensure access of the ligand to the targeted cell-surface molecule [49][50][51][52]. However, since the purpose of PEG is to provide a stealth effect, the presence of the targeting ligand at the distal end of PEG could introduce a new target for opsonins [25,53]. EGF, which is a small peptide, was directly attached to the Au NP surface and 'hidden' by the long-chain PEG (i.e. PEG6000). Interestingly, although PEG had a modest inhibitory effect on EGF-EGFR interaction, PEGylated EGF-Au NP targeted EGFR and were efficiently taken up by MDA-MB-468 cells/xenografts without compromising the PEG stealth effect. \n\nPEGylation can help prevent sequestration of NP by the MPS. However, accumulation in the liver and spleen is still commonly observed for NP with hydrodynamic size of over 8 nm, representing a general challenge for targeted drug delivery nanosystems. This phenomenon may be further compounded by the interaction of the EGF moiety with EGFR in normal tissues, particularly the liver. \n\nWe investigated whether coadministration of unlabelled targeting ligands (i.e. EGF) could mitigate this effect and found that the in vivo fate of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 NP, as seen from SPECT scans (Figure 5 and S6) and biodistribution data (Figure 7C and 7D), was indeed altered. Unlabelled EGF (30 \u00b5g) inhibited the accumulation of radioactivity in liver, spleen and kidney.",

In the ratio of 2:1, the combined anti-tumor effect of the dual drug-loaded LNPs was the best and could develop the ability of the drugs to the largest extent, suggesting the best DOX:SOR ratio in the LNP formulations. \n\nIn vivo drug distribution of LNPs was higher in tumor tissue and lower in the heart and kidney, which could decrease side effects during tumor therapy. Conversely, drug solution samples are mainly distributed in heart and kidney. This may lead to systemic toxicity. Higher distribution of drugs in LNPs in tumors than in other tissues, especially at 48 hours of testing, might be due to the sustained release behavior and targeted ability of the LNPs, thus prolonging blood circulation time and better targeting the tumor site. Higher accumulation of NAcGal-DOX/SOR LNPs than DOX/SOR LNPs was observed in the tumor tissue. This could be evidence that the NAcGal ligands would bring about the target ability to the LNP system. Toxicity of LNPs was studied in hepatocellular carcinoma bearing mice in terms of body weight changes. On Day 21, mice treated with LNPs showed no obvious changes in body weight, while free drugs led to over 20% body weight loss. The decrease of body weight in free drug treated mice is likely due to the toxicity caused by free DOX and SOR distributed to normal organs. Considering the results along with the blood enzyme level analysis and tissue distribution, these LNPs groups could be indicative of tumor cell death and not necessarily nonspecific tissue damage. \n\nIn vivo antitumor efficiency of LNPs was evaluated in BALB/c mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma. The HepG2 cell line is an aggressive cancer cell line with a high proliferation rate, and saline-treated mice displayed a rapid increase in tumor size during the experiment.",

            "text": "Currently, the next breakthrough in the field of LNP is the ability to divert the nucleic acid payload away from the liver and allow access to extra-hepatic sites that would enable treatment of any genetic diseases from cancer to Alzheimer's. The major issue to be addressed is the propensity of LNP accumulating in the liver upon systemic administration [59,60]. The current gold standard LNP based on DLinMC3DMA and ALC-0315 are lipids known to associate with ApoE, which are readily taken up by the liver. In order to escape the liver, the strategy whereby increasing PEG-lipid content to prevent the ApoE binding and deviate the endogenous targeting away from the liver has shown limited success in prolonging circulation and redistributing the LNP to extrahepatic sites [59,60]. A potential strategy is to use a targeting ligand to facilitate the uptake of LNP to specific organs [162,163]. Studies led by the Muzykantov laboratory have demonstrated the successful conjugation of antibodies targeting vascular adhesion molecule PECAM-1 or ICAM-1 and re-directing the LNP accumulation away from the liver to the lung [164,165] or VCAM-1 and targeting to the cerebral endothelium during brain edema [165]. A similar approach, using CD-4 antibody conjugated to the surface of the LNP, directed uptake into all T cells (na\u00efve, central, memory, and effector) in both spleen and lymph enabling the possibility to conduct chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in vivo [166]. Targeting ligands can re-distribute the LNP to extrahepatic sites; however, these examples are only demonstrated in small research scale settings. The current commercial manufacturing of mRNA-LNP is dependent on multiple steps that are not necessarily amenable to adding the targeting aspect. To ensure the manufacturing success of targeting LNP, two processes must be optimized: large scale production of the ligand, often a biological drug substance that is difficult and costly to manufacture, and the conjugation step to couple the ligand to the LNP.",

            "text": "As in hepatic targets, there are no direct carrier (ApoE) mediated targeting avenues for extra-hepatic targets. Several approaches, therefore, have been employed for non-hepatic targets. In this regard, selective organ targeting (SORT) has been explored by Dillard and coworkers [59], where a fifth component (or SORT molecule), in addition to the conventional four-lipid composition of LNPs, enables extrahepatic targeting of LNPs. The authors hypothesized that after desorption of PEG lipids on the LNP surface, the underlying SORT molecules are exposed and recognized by distinct serum proteins. These serum proteins then adsorb onto the LNP surface and lead the LNPs to the targeted organ by interacting with cognate receptors expressed by cells in the target organs, akin to the ApoE-based LNP accumulation in the liver. The group successfully demonstrated liver, spleen, and lung delivery, and has shown potential for other important delivery targets. The SORT molecule library also consists of lipids of diverse pKas. It was determined that 6-7 pKa lipids are best suited to liver targeting, greater than 9 pKa lipids are ideal for lung targeting, and 2-6 pKa lipids are best suited to spleen targeting [59]. \n\nMeyer et al. [60] have also thoroughly reviewed extrahepatic targeting for mRNA delivery, which was found be in concurrence with the SORT approach, where positively charged lipids and negatively charged LNPs were found to preferentially accumulate in the lungs and spleen, respectively. Additionally, poly-beta amino ester (PBAE) polymer [61,62], 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA) lipid, 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipid [63], and polyacrylic acid (PAA) polymers [64] were found to target the lungs by altering the PEG lipid, helper lipid, and N/P ratio.",

            "text": "The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60]. This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151]. Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59]. \n\nLocalization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128]. However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152]. ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell.",

            "text": "Here we explored how surface chemistry influences the intra-organ distribution, transfer, and excretion patterns of three types of functional GNPs (PEG-GNPs, CS-GNPs and PEI-GNPs) in vivo. The surface chemistry varied depending on the attached ligand and the final structural mode. Our study showed that the differences in surface chemistry induced dramatically different effects on the biodistribution, intra-organ transfer, and elimination profiles of these GNPs in mice. We propose that the surface chemistry induced dispersion stability of GNPs is one of the main mechanisms underlying functional GNP interactions in vivo. \n\nThe GNP surface chemistry-mediated biodistribution profiles are likely related to blood flow dynamics, cellular phenotype in the MPS, and how the GNPs agglomerate in the biological environment. The long circulatory time of PEGylated GNPs, an expected feature, demonstrated the ability of PEG to minimize opsonization and clearance by MPS sequestration. Within organs, the liver and spleen have been reported to possess a high arterial and venous blood flow but slow blood flow (200-800 \u00b5m s \u22121 ) in liver or splenic sinusoids. A prolonged retention time within the sinusoids would provide more opportunity for intracellular uptake [31]. The non-parenchymal liver cells, namely KCs and liver sinusoidal ECs, were major sites of NP capture, likely because they are first to interact with GNPs when they enter the liver and are highly phagocytic. However, a considerable amount of the well-dispersed PEG-GNPs were not captured by KCs or ECs, but remained in the circulation or were extravasated into Disse space via hepatic sinusoidal fenestrated endothelium (fenestrations approximately 100-200 nm in diameter) and eventually taken up by hepatocytes.",

Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105,161].",

Even though the influence of PEG loading was shown and good binding to isolated \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin receptors in vitro was found (which could be improved with higher RGD loading), these results could not be confirmed in vivo with biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies. Consequently, an optimized balance between PEGylation and RGD loading needs to be found to achieve ideal specific tumor targeting in vivo. Nonetheless, the results of this work still show that LNPs are an attractive tool for targeting strategies.

Adding PEG lipids to LNPs increases circulation half-life, essential for effective in vivo delivery [288]. However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference [288]. LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors [288,289]. This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein [288,290]. After cellular uptake, endosomal escape of siRNA into the cytosol is facilitated through interactions between ionizable cationic lipids and anionic endogenous lipids in the endosomal membrane [291], enabling siRNA to silence the targeted gene.",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

Several ligands (e.g., aptamers, sugars, antibodies and antibody fragments, vitamins, and aptamers) have been coupled on the LNP surface through various approaches, including direct conjugation of targeting ligands onto preformed LNPs and postinsertion of lipid conjugated molecules onto preformed LNPs, thus enabling targeted delivery. Antibodies and their various formats have been conjugated to LNPs, and the resultant conjugates have shown successful retargeting of LNPs to multiple extrahepatic cells and tissues, including immune cells, lymph nodes, bone marrow, cancer cells, and endothelial cells (Table 3). \n\nN-Acetyl Galactosamine.

            "text": ", functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264]. Despite these difficulties, there are promising examples which have already demonstrated efficient, cell-or tissue-specific delivery of nucleic acids. Additionally, scientists have started to exploit the protein corona to tune particle distribution in vivo. It is commonly known that plasma proteins adsorption depends on particle surface characteristics. Hence, slight structural changes of the particle surface have shown to affect the protein corona composition. As a consequence of protein corona modification, transport to target cells by coating with certain plasma proteins which serve as endogenous ligands can be obtained in vivo. For example, DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes have shown to adsorb vitronectin which mediated receptor-dependent uptake by tumor cells expressing \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrins [265]. Patisiran is another prominent example for targeted transport to hepatocytes, mediated by coating with endogenous ApoE [104,137]. Manipulation of the interaction with receptors in vivo and therefore targeted delivery to other cell types could be achieved by an altered protein corona as a consequence of exchanging certain lipid components of the Patisiran formulation [146]. Additionally, Saunders et al. used \"nanoprimers\" administered shortly before injection of therapeutic LNPs that were taken up by cells of the hepatic RES (Fig. 6B). By inhibiting KCs and LSECs, LNPs could be preferentially delivered to hepatocytes, the desired target site [266].\n\nBased on these observations, methods which enable fast screening of broad libraries of nucleic acid carriers in vivo were developed [106][107][108][109]. By means of that, evaluation and characterization of predominant plasma proteins in the corona and tuning the biodistribution profile based on facile structural variations becomes feasible, pathing the way for improved targeted, cell-specific nucleic acid delivery in vivo (see Fig. 6C) [110,[142][143][144][145].  5 Interaction of i",

            "text": "administration [54]. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that the physicochemical similarity of the commonly referred to as LNPs to VLDL and the propensity to adsorb ApoE in blood plasma, enhances the accumulation of this kind of lipid systems in the liver and the internalization into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor [81]. Although the reports identified here for active liver targeting highlight the extensive efforts and strategies employed to efficiently deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to hepatocytes, LNPs have emerged as the most advanced non-viral carriers for delivering nucleic acids to liver. However, the hepatocyte-targeting ability of LNPs relays on endogenous mechanisms, and for this reason, scarce studies involving LNPs have been identified in this systematic review, focused on active targeting. In this regard, LNPs lacking any active targeting ligand have been studied to deliver mRNA encoding \u03b1-Gal A to hepatocytes of Fabry mice and non-human primates after i.v. administration [82,83]. Despite further studies with these LNPs have not been reported up to date, initial results showed the production of functional \u03b1-Gal A in the liver, which then was secreted into the circulation. Secreted \u03b1-Gal A was taken up by distal tissues such as kidney, heart, and spleen and attenuated substrate accumulation in affected tissues. These hallmarks, while valuable for liver hepatocyte applications, severely limit the use of these LNP technologies beyond the liver. Recently, a methodology termed selective organ targeting (SORT) has been developed, which enables controllable delivery of nucleic acids to target tissues [65]. SORT LNPs involve the inclusion of SORT molecules, such as chargebased lipids, that accurately tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after i.v. administration. This strategy, added to the recognized efficacy of LNPs, represents a great advance in the development of systems targeting extrahepatic organs, and it has been included in at least two patents [84,85].",

            "text": "They also considered that gene delivery requires endosomal escape to function in the cytoplasm, so they designed an iPhos phospholipid consisting of an ionizable amine head and three alkyl chains as a tail, based on the ability to specifically deliver to extrahepatic tissues, from which the LNP can effectively achieve organ-selective delivery and endosomal escape in target cells, with an in vivo efficiency of up to 965-fold compared to conventional LNP [84]. \n\nFollowing this, Dilliard et al. further analyzed the specific mechanism by which SORT-LNP breaks through the hepatic accumulation limit to achieve organ-tissue specific targeting [124]. This helped to drive the optimization of SORT-LNP for therapeutic applications in tissues and organs such as lung, liver, and spleen, greatly expanding the scope of mRNA vaccines and drugs as well as CRISPR gene editing therapies. This study found that the chemistry of the added SORT molecule controlled the organ-level biodistribution, acid dissociation constant (pKa), and serum protein adsorption of SORT-LNP. Specifically, PEGylated lipids dissociate from the LNP surface and expose SORT molecules, different serum proteins recognize the exposed SORT molecules and adsorb to the LNP surface, and surface-adsorbed proteins interact with cellexpressed cognate receptors in target organs to facilitate mRNA delivery to these tissues (Figure 10(b)). These findings establish a critical link between the molecular composition of SORT-LNP and its unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that recruitment of specific proteins to the LNP surface can enable targeted delivery outside the liver. The results of this study suggest that endogenous targeting, that is, tuning the molecular composition of nanoparticles to bind to specific proteins in the serum so that they can be delivered to the target site may be an effective strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of nanocarriers.",

Such structural stabilization after PEGylation may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force preventing the association of LNP with surrounding proteins, blood cells or LNPs in the blood [30]. \n\nThe mRNA introduction efficiency to the cultured cells decreased after LNP PEGylation, which may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force inhibiting the non-specific interaction of LNPs to cells",

[70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "In a very interesting study, Lokugamage et al. [75] demonstrated the PEGylation-mediated stability and long-term distribution of LNPs [75]. They loaded high-and low-PEG LNPs with luciferase to determine their stability. They found that LNPs with a lower mol% of PEG exceeded the quality control cut-off (200 nm in size), indicating the necessity of PEG for delivering high-quality LNPs. Moreover, high PEGylated LNPs showed improved long-term distribution effects, as indicated by their luciferase intensities after 48 h. This proves a lower degradation of luciferase and, consequently, higher stability [109]. \n\nIn addition, PEGylated lipids are also involved in protecting LNPs through mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) clearance [102,110]. Further studies have cumulatively determined their roles in improving encapsulation of nucleic acids, increasing circulatory half-lives, in vivo distribution, and immune response. Conclusively, these decrease fusogenicity and increase the overall stability [85] and bioavailability [103]. \n\nBesides structure, surface modification is another key approach in modulating the characteristics of LNPs to specific target cell types. As discussed above, the off-target effect associated with many nanomedicines remains a limitation that needs to be overcome, as it implies an increased dose of drug to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and reduces the bioavailability of the drug. Affinity targeting of the LNPs to the BC lesions can be easily achieved due to several chemical surface modifications [23,111]. By attaching smart molecules to the available functional groups of the lipids the selectivity and effectiveness can be certainly improved. In a very recent study, Kim et al. engineered LNPs for pTEN mRNA delivery in TNBC cells [112]. They presented a PD-L1-targeting LNP integrating peptides with strong PD-L1 binding affinity onto the LNP surface by conjugating them with PEGylated lipid. This led to an increased affinity for the target, by obtaining an augmented selectivity. These results clearly indicate how the targeting therapy leads to an improved, personalized and more effective treatment.",

            "text": "owever, it should be underlined that one of the main challenges in using LNPs as drug delivery vehicles is their tendency to aggregate. By coating LNPs with PEG, the hydrophilic PEG chains create a steric hindrance that hinders the interaction of LNPs with each other, thus preventing aggregation. Hence, if effective strategies are developed to produce stealth LNPs without relying on PEGylation, it will also be essential to devise methods to reduce their tendency to aggregate. \n\nAnother constraint of the approved LNPs is their untargeted nature, resulting in a lack of specificity regarding their delivery to cells or tissues. This lack of targeting capability increases the potential for unwanted, off-target accumulation of the vaccine components, which can potentially lead to unpredictable side effects. LNP optimization for the efficient transfection of APCs, having a crucial role in the immune response, might improve the efficiency of the current mRNA vaccines. \n\nOne of the primary goals of future research will be to enhance LNP vaccines with a distinct targeting ability, specifically directed toward APCs. Among possible targeting strategies (reviewed in ref 21), one of the most consolidated approaches involves the conjugation of ligands to PEG moieties, creating stealth and targeted nanomedicine. This strategy aims to combine the supposed benefits of PEGylation with the specific binding capabilities of ligands, enabling targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues. However, issues related to ligand specificity, stability, and binding affinity play crucial roles in the success of targeted delivery. Other challenges include the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of target cells, which can exhibit variations in receptor expression and internalization mechanisms. Furthermore, the immune system's response to targeted NPs, such as the development of antidrug antibodies or immune clearance, poses additional hurdles to successful delivery. Despite extensive research in this field, the translation of targeted NP delivery into clinical applications has been therefore hindered, resulting in limited success. 22 In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property. The length of the acyl chain of PEG also regulates the intracellular delivery of a drug into the target cell. Usually, to the membrane of LNPs, the PEG-lipid is anchored using the hydrophobic acyl chain [62]. PEG-lipids having short acyl chains dissociate quickly from the LNPs following injection (since less energy is required in order to break the anchoring bonds present between the PEG-lipid and LNP), allowing the LNPs to better interact with target cells. For instance, PEG-lipids with C14 acyl chains take a half-time of around 1 h to dissociate from LNPs, while PEG-lipids with C20 acyl chains take 24 h or longer half-times for dissociation. PEG shields the LNP from the serum protein such as apolipoproteins (ApoE) and albumins. Judge et al. revealed that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids, showed longer circulation time and thereby enhanced the efficacy LNPs as compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids. The reduced association of ApoE was observed due to the highly shielded LNPs provided by mPEG200. [71]. This resulted in longer circulation which led to a greater opportunity of LNPs to enter subcutaneous tumour cells [72]. However, an excessive amount of PEGylation in LNP could inhibit cellular internalization and intracellular release of the drug, resulting in reduced intracellular delivery [73]. \n\nSuzuki et al. also studied the PEG shedding profiles of DMG-LNP and DSG-LNP, respectively for encapsulation of siRNA specific for GFP or FVII. DMG-PEG with shorter acyl chains displayed faster shedding from the LNPs than the DSG-PEG having the longer acyl chain.",

All identified Lung SORT LNPs targeted the lungs effectively and hold promise for further development and optimization. Following an analysis of both lung delivery efficacy and specificity, DOTAP40 LNPs and DDAB30 LNPs were selected for further consideration. \n\nDuring the evaluation process, we found that DDAB LNPs exhibited some toxicity after treatment. To further confirm this, in vivo toxicity of DOTAP40 and DDAB30 LNPs treatments were evaluated by measuring serum biomarkers relating to liver function (ALT and AST) and kidney function (BUN and CREA). Higher toxicity in the liver was observed in the DDAB30 LNP treatment group after 24 h (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 2). We also monitored the body weight changes and noted increased weight loss in mice treated with DDAB30 LNPs, suggesting higher acute toxicity (Fig. 2h). At the end of the study, mice were sacrificed, and organs (liver, spleen, and lung) were excised and weighed. The liver/body weight ratio and spleen/body weight ratio were increased with DDAB30 LNP treatment, suggesting higher toxicity (Fig. 2i). Immunohistochemistry (H&E staining) results showed that obvious tissue damages were detected in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse organs and DDAB30 LNP-treated mouse organs (such as heart and liver), but not from DOTAP40 LNP treated mouse organs (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

            "text": "Without appropriate surface coating, the extensive uptake of the non-PEGylated 111 In-EGF-Au into the liver and spleen is consistent with the rapid clearance of these NP by the MPS, as reported for other non-coated NP [45,46]. In contrast, when mice received 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000, there was visible accumulation of radioactivity in MDA-MB-468 xenografts on SPECT scans from 24 h (Figure 5 and S6). Furthermore, liver uptake was 2-fold lower compared to animals that received 111 In-EGF-Au (Figure 6). Uptake into 231-H2N tumours was less obvious, as expected. The biodistribution data derived from harvested organs were consistent with these findings. After dosing with 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000, the amount of radioactivity that accumulated in MDA-MB-468 xenografts at 72 p.i was 2.81 %ID/g, which was almost 2-fold higher than the amount in 231-H2N xenografts (1.43 %ID/g) (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the liver uptake was approximately 10 %ID/g in mice bearing both types of xenograft, which is 39.5-50.3% lower than the values obtained following administration of non-PEGylated NP. However, the radioactivity uptake in both spleen and kidney was greater than that observed in mice that received non-PEGylated NP. \n\nPEGylation of NP has been shown to confer the ability to evade opsonisation [24,26], resulting in a lower percentage of NP being taken up by phagocytic cells in the liver. Therefore, the NP remain in circulation for sufficient time to reach the tumour, which accounts for the increased uptake of the PEGylated NP into the MDA-MB-468 xenografts. The increased uptake of NP into the spleen following PEGylation has been observed by others [45]. EGFR is reported to be widely expressed (e.g.",

            "text": "RNA interference represents a highly attractive alternative to current treatment regimens, however, extrahepatic delivery of siRNA using LNPs has proven difficult due to high liver accumulation. Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands could potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA-4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake of LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence for the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-based therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a short circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will improve the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation time is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetuned modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase the circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduced endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune response [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated in LNPs for in vivo usage. As an alternative, PEG could be replaced with polysaccharides, naturally occurring membrane lipids, or stealth-providing compounds such as polysarcosine to shield the nanoparticle from rapid removal by opsonization [52][53][54][55][56]. Additionally, an attractive concept is passive targeting by changing the lipid formulation, however, little is known about the optimal lipid composition for bone marrow targeting [57][58][59]. For liposomes, it is reported that cholesterol aids in bone marrow uptake by phagocytic cells via selective opsonization such as C3 complement protein-an interesting point for future studies on targeting the bone marrow with LNPs [60,61].",

            "text": "Despite constituting the smallest molar percentage of lipids in LNPs, typically around 1.5 mol%, PEG-lipids exert a substantial impact on the critical properties of LNPs. Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

Given that anti-PEG antibodies can stunt the efficacy of PEGylated lipid-based carriers, there is a need for solutions to the \"PEG dilemma\". 102 o help address the targeting limitations of LNPs, Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) was recently developed to deliver LNPs to extrahepatic tissues such as the lung and spleen. 56 owever, SORT LNPs rely on using either toxic cationic lipids for lung targeting, which severely limit the dosage and narrow the therapeutic window, or anionic lipids for spleen targeting, which to some extent attenuate the RNA transfection potency. 107 Moreover, only two extra-hepatic tissues, the lung, and spleen, can be targeted by this approach. 56 Hence, there is a need to develop nontoxic and more potent LNPs for the precise and effective delivery of RNA therapeutics across a broader range of different target tissues.",

            "text": "Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92]. Specifically, in the endogenous targeting pathway, LNPs rapidly enter the Disse space from the blood and gradually accumulate, then being slowly absorbed by the cells. In contrast, in the active targeting pathway, LNPs exhibit slower and more sustained cellular uptake, remaining in the blood for a longer period. Although active targeting can enhance the specificity of the mRNA-LNPs by incorporating additional targeting ligands, its implementation for hepatocyte targeting is less common due to increased formulation complexity. Currently, liver-specific delivery research predominantly employs passive and endogenous targeting. \n\nBesides hepatocytes, other cells also play important roles in liver diseases and can serve as the target cells of mRNA NPs [121]. For example, HSCs are important effector cells in liver fibrosis [122], while liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are significant in immunotherapy and a proposed target for immunomodulation [113,123]. \n\nHowever, HSCs are difficult to transfect, and the complexity of the liver microenvironment during liver fibrosis further compounds the difficulty of targeting HSCs. To address these challenges, Younis et al. designed a ligand-free mRNA-LNP containing CL15A6 lipid of hydrophobic scaffold structure (Fig. 7B) [108]. This formulation achieved successful transfection of over 80% of HSCs in vivo in liver fibrosis mice. The CL15A6-LNP had a diameter of approximately 80 nm, allowing it to pass through the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium. Additionally, the LNP pKa was about 7.25, which made LNPs unrecognizable by ApoE, thus avoiding substantial interactions with hepatocytes. Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

            "text": "Pegylation of LNP surface via polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays a pivotal role in improving LNP stability and facilitating readily tissue penetration and targeting.Pegylation strategy has been widely used in many drug modalities and delivery systems.Since PEG is an amphiphilic lipid that can interact with both the hydrophobic core of the LNPs and the hydrophilic environment of physiological conditions or storage buffers, it plays a crucial role in regulating the clearance and half-life of LNPs, as well as on-shelf stability.Typically, the half-life of LNPs depends on the length of PEG lipid.The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream.Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64].The lipid structure of pegylation also has a significant effect on LNP function.[35], while PEG lipids with longer C18 alkyl chain were more capable of longer circulation [65].In a nonviral gene therapy to treat traumatic brain injury, DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 were compared.They formulated siRNA and mRNA LNPs with various ratios of DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 and discovered that the increase in the proportion of DSPE-PEG 2000 led to longer blood circulation with enhanced gene expression in the injured brain hemisphere [66].\n\nBesides optimizing the choice of the hydrophobic domain of PEG lipids, regulating the affinity (or shedding rate) of PEG lipids is another trending strategy.The presence of PEG on the surface of nanoparticles may hinder cell uptake of nanoparticles.PEG lipids on LNPs are expected to shed from LNP in a controlled way after administrations, thus inducing cellular internalizations at the target site and also maintaining high serum stability.Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

            "text": "In vivo transfection studies demonstrated that particles with the shorter Tween 20 were able to target the lymph nodes more efficiently. The longer Tween 80, on the other hand, formed LNPs that targeted the spleen but with lower efficiency. LNPs with the linear DSPE-PEG showed predominantly localized transfection at the injection site. Altogether, this study demonstrated that PEGylation of LNPs with branched PEG is a viable approach to target organs with effective transfection selectively [52]. It is hypothesized that, aside from the molecular weight and structure, the PEG density on the particle is also an important factor. Across the three types of LNPs, PEGylation of positively charged lipid nanoparticles showed much difference than bare ones [52]. PEGylation prevented positively charged lipid nanoparticles from high retention at the site of administration. Whilst PEGylation has been proven useful to prevent premature clearance of particle from the systemic circulation, the production of anti-PEG antibodies has emerged as detrimental co-lateral damage. Recently, efforts have been directed towards alternative strategies with biocompatible polymers to prevent the production of anti-PEG antibodies after the first dose that would otherwise lead to a loss of therapeutic efficacy with potential for adverse effects upon subsequent doses [53]. Concurrently, Chen et al. \n\nfound that incorporation of 4 mol% dexamethasones in lipid-based nanoparticles was able to suppress the immune responses and antibody production after injection [26], which might be promising for the development of pegylated lipid nanocarriers. Aside from relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake of nanoparticles, formulation scientists have realized that, by conjugation of a receptor ligand to the particle surface, uptake into target cells could be enhanced. Modification of lipidbased nanoparticles with targeting ligands is a key strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems into the lymph nodes or other desired tissues/cells. For example, Vu et al. functionalized liposome surface with Hemagglutinin Antigen (HA) to improve antibody production efficiency [54].",

For example, in the context of an LNP-mRNA vaccine, it is advantageous for LNPs to have a favourable corona for targeting and transfecting immune cells in lymphatic organs to induce an effective immune response. Yet, achieving extrahepatic delivery still remains a challenging topic within the field due to the lack of understanding between the nano-bio relationship.

All LNPs maintained a particle size below 100 nm and encapsulation efficiencies above 90%. We included IV administration of DMG-PEG LNPs as a baseline control to highlight the well-known liver accumulation typically seen with conventional PEG-lipid LNPs via IV injection. We showed that with the change of the administration route from IV to IM, the DMG-PEG2K LNPs' liver accumulation pattern did not change. Following IM injection of ~12 \u00b5g mRNA per mouse, ex vivo IVIS imaging (Figure 2) revealed that independent of the PS-80 percentage, Fluc-PS80 LNPs yielded, on average, a 3-to-5-fold higher luciferase signal in the spleen relative to DMG-PEG2K formulations (Figure 2c). Moreover, the spleen-to-liver expression ratio exceeded 50-fold in the PS-80 groups (Figure 2d), suggesting substantially enhanced extrahepatic uptake. Based on these promising results, we next refined the formulation buffer, cryoprotectant concentration, and lipid composition, to then evaluate the long-term stability of the optimized PS-80 LNP platform for the SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccine.",

The latter approach is referred to as active targeting. 156 lthough the active targeting of nanoparticles has demonstrated high potential for use in vitro, the in vivo efficiency in HCC has usually been limited. Addressing this issue will require intense focus on the design and features of the nanocarrier itself rather than focusing only on the targeting ligand that can exert its full performance at the target cells only after overcoming the successive in vivo biological barriers that precede the cellular uptake process. As a case study, we modified LNPs with a HCC-targeting peptide, SP94, for the co-delivery of SOR and MK-siRNA to HCC cells. Although the SP94 peptide has demonstrated outstanding selectivity for HCC cells in vitro, 4 the initially prepared LNPs failed to access HCC or induce gene silencing in vivo. Subsequently, we designed an integrative strategy that was focused on tweaking the composition and physico-chemical properties of LNPs to control their in vivo performance and tackle the successive challenges associated with gene delivery to HCC. The composition of the LNPs was carefully optimized to improve their pharmacokinetic profile. Microfluidics technology was applied to prepare ultra-small LNPs (usLNPs) with an average particle diameter ~60 nm to maximize their ability to penetrate the stroma barrier in the tumor microenvironment and reach HCC cells.",

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that surface chemistrymediated dispersion stability plays a critical role in the intra-organ transfer, and excretion patterns of functional GNPs in vivo. The PEG-GNPs maintained dispersion properties in vivo, facilitating passage through the discontinuous liver/spleen sinusoidal endothelium or fenestrated glomerular endothelium, subsequently penetrating deep into the organ and finally being eliminated via the hepatobiliary or renal route. The stability of the GNP surface ligands in vivo influenced protein adsorption, agglomeration/aggregation, and interaction with different cell types within organs. The Au-S bond between the PEG ligand and the GNP is highly stable and likely reduces protein adsorption in a physiological environment, keeping PEG-GNPs well-dispersed in vivo. However, some PEI ligands could detach from the GNP surfaces and/or adsorb serum proteins, leading to GNP agglomeration/aggregation in vivo and interception by KCs and ECs in MPS rich organs. This impeded their excretion via a renal or hepatobiliary route. The long-term accumulation of CS-GNPs and PEI-GNPs in the liver induced more significant hepatic damage and changes in gene expression associated with metabolic processes, immune response, and signal transduction. \n\nThe study provides evidence that manipulation of NP surface chemistry could bias the NPs to certain cell types or elimination pathways in vivo, furthering the clinical translation potential of non-biodegradable nanoparticles.",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.",

Given the apparent tropism of the lcLNPs containing 40 mol % ESM for bone marrow and spleen we examined protein expression in both tissues (as well as liver) for Onpattro LNP GFP mRNA and lcLNP GFP mRNA following systemic administration (3 mg mRNA/kg) in mice. Translation of GFP in liver, spleen, and bone marrow was investigated at a cellular level using flow cytometry, the uptake in hepatocytes, splenocytes, and bone marrow cells was assessed using the fluorescence arising from trace levels of DiD. The details regarding gating strategies can be found in the methods. \n\nConsiderable LNP accumulation was observed in hepatocytes for both Onpattro and lcLNP formulations at 4 and 24 h post injection. At 24 h, LNP accumulation was detected in 60% and 70% of hepatocytes for the 10% and 40% ESM formulations, respectively (Fig- ure 6A). For both formulations the percentage of DiD-positive cells increased significantly from 4 to 24 h (Figure 6A). Remarkably, the proportion of hepatocytes expressing GFP at both 4 and 24 hours post infection was significantly higher for LNP mRNA containing 40% ESM compared with the 10% ESM formulation (Figure 6B) or the classic Onpattro formulation containing 10 mol % DSPC (see Figures S1A and S1B). \n\nIn the case of the spleen, LNP GFP mRNA systems containing 40 mol % ESM exhibited preferential distribution to the spleen relative to LNP GFP mRNA containing 10% ESM at both 4 and 24 h post injection (Figure 7A).

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "As described previously, LNP systems exhibiting long circulation characteristics are essential to achieving enhanced accumulation at tumor sites. In this context, it was important to establish that the presence of the (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG did not negatively impact the circulation lifetime of the PEG-DSG LNP systems employed here. This is of potential concern since (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG contains three carboxylic acid chemical groups at its hydrophilic terminal end (Figure 3). The pKa values of these carboxylic acid groups are predicted to be 3.11, 3.69, and 3.99 (Marvin, ChemAxon, http://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/), indicating that this PSMA-targeting ligand will possess a strong negative charge at physiological pH. Consistent with these estimates, the zeta-potential of LNP containing 1 mol% of (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG was determined to be \u221214.97 \u00b1 9.34 mV, whereas nontargeted LNP exhibited a zeta-potential of \u22124.91 \u00b1 11 mV. LNPs exhibiting negative charges can be rapidly cleared from the bloodstream via opsonization by serum proteins and subsequent accumulation in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver and spleen. 39,40 he circulation lifetime of the PSMA-targeting LNP was determined following i.v. administration of tritiated ( 3 H) PSMA-targeted or nontargeted LNP to mice at 1 mg siRNA/ kg body weight (see Materials and Methods). Blood was collected via intracardiac sampling at 0.5, 2, 8, 24 hours postinjection and the percentage of the injected LNP remaining in the circulation was determined (Figure 5). Importantly, the   PSMA-targeted and nontargeted LNPs exhibited very similar circulation properties; both formulations had t 1/2 values of approximately 10-12 hours.",

            "text": "This suggests that the length of the PEG 6000 chain is sufficient to offer an efficient surface charge-shielding effect even in the presence of attached EGF. Surface charge, together with size, shape and surface coating, impacts the in vivo fate of NP. It has been shown that highly negatively or positively charged NP can cause undesirable liver uptake while neutral or slightly negative NP (e.g. ~ -10 mV) result in reduced liver uptake and more efficient tumour accumulation [24,42,43]. This supports the choice of DTPA-EGF-Au-PEG6000, which is slightly negatively charged, for in vivo studies. 111 In-labelling of NP was confirmed by ITLC and phosphorimaging (Figure 2A). After incubation with 111 InCl 3 , the radiolabelling yield of all NP variants was > 90%. Further study of the possible impact of PEGylation on the integrity and radiolabelling of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG NP was investigated using size-exclusion HPLC. \n\nHPLC analysis showed that at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, the Rt of 111 In-EGF-Au, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG800, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG2000 and 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 was 8.98, 8.97, 8.90 and 8.81 min, respectively (Table 2 and Figure S1). To confirm that the reduced Rt was due to PEGylation leading to greater NP size rather than Rt variation, the flow rate was reduced to 0.5 mL/min. This resulted in Rt values of 11.66, 11.61, 11.48 and 11.39 min for 111 In-EGF-Au, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG800, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG2000 and 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 respectively, demonstrating that increasing NP size after PEGylation results in progressive shortening of Rt (Table 2).",

(H) (I) Changes in the mean fluorescence intensity of ACQ984-PCL in the liver and spleen in vivo (n = 3) and ex vivo (n = 3) and the corresponding correlations ACQ984-PEG-PCL nanoparticles were more prone to accumulation in the spleen and were even retained for several days (Fig. 6C, D&S9F-H). The ACQ984-PCL nanoparticles showed stronger fluorescence intensity in the liver but exhibited increased fluorescence within 30 min to 1 h, after which they were rapidly eliminated in the spleen (Fig. 6C and D, S9I & S9J). The in vivo behaviors of the three types of nanoparticles correspond to their own properties. PMs with a small size and dense PEG coverage could avoid capture by the MPS and be retained in blood for a long time. They can pass through the space between liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and mainly accumulate in the liver due to the high tissue blood supply. PCL nanoparticles, which are much larger and have highly hydrophobic surfaces, are prone to opsonization by complement proteins and capturing by macrophages located in organs of the MPS, especially the liver, resulting in rapid blood elimination and rapid liver accumulation. PEG-PCL nanoparticles with partial PEG coverage showed a moderate in vivo elimination rate. Compared to that of the PCL nanoparticles, the longer blood circulation time of the mPEG-PCL nanoparticles may increase the likelihood of accessing MPS organs other than the liver, such as the spleen. The fact that PEGylation aids in hepatic evasion but facilitates splenic trapping was consistent with earlier findings [61]. \n\nThe distribution behaviors of nanocarriers are commonly demonstrated by fluorescence imaging of ex vivo tissues with semiquantification. The current study tests the plausibility of in vivo imaging of nanocarrier distribution and in situ real-time PK analysis.",

            "text": "Polymers are the most common LNP surface modifiers. Their unique structures impart special functions to carriers, such as increased residence time in the body and targeting ability [117,118]. PEGylation is a surface modification strategy used to improve the bioavailability of various LNP-based DDSs by modifying polyethylene glycol (PEG)attached membrane lipids (Figure 5A) [136]. PEG has dissolution properties in water and polymers and is harmless to the human body because it is non-antigenic [137]. The PEGylated carriers become stealth from the reticuloendothelial system (RES), increasing persistence in the body and inducing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which imparts the passive targeting ability of tumor cells [119,120]. Liu et al. [32] reported that the amphiphilicity of PEG could increase the drug release rate by reducing the surface tension of LNPs. Moreover, LNP surface modification using PEGylated lipids forms a polymer layer on the exterior membrane to improve the membrane stability and prevent nanoparticle aggregation [121,138]. \n\nVarious DDS studies have demonstrated the enhanced drug delivery efficiency by PE-Gylation in LNPs. Yuan et al. [122] evaluated the bioavailability enhancement of PEGylation after the oral administration of SLNs. According to this study, PEGylated-SLNs (PEG-SLNs) increase penetration into the mimetic intestinal epithelial cell (Caco-2/HT29) monolayer and displays a higher stability in simulated intestinal fluid (Figure 5B). In addition, pharmacokinetic studies have revealed that SLN bioavailability changes approximately two-fold via PEGylation. In PEGylated LNPs (PEG-LNPs), the oral absorption rate of fenofibrate is increased. Furthermore, simulated lipolysis in digestive fluid has suggested that PE-Gylation resists the degradation of LNPs from lipase [140]. Additionally, the stability of PEG-LNPs is maintained even under bile acid exposure conditions [141]. The notable functional improvement via LNP PEGlyation has also been studied in injectable formulations.",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of LNPs such as particle size and surface charge are critical for siRNA delivery via systemic administration. When their properties are not satisfactory for systemic drug delivery, almost all LNPs injected are captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and rapidly eliminated from the blood, resulting in poor accumulation in a target tissue [108]. To avoid such unfavorable biorecognition, the particle size of LNPs is commonly in the range of 30 to 150 nm; and the surface of LNPs is often covered with PEG. Modification of LNPs with PEG is well known to enhance their dispersibility in aqueous solution and to improve their stability in the blood. On the other hand, the presence of PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the interaction between LNPs and target cells, which reduction diminishes their internalization into the cells. Therefore, the formulation of PEGylated LNPs should be optimized for the purpose of PEGylation. The amount of a PEG-lipid conjugate for modifying the surface of LNPs strongly influences the physicochemical properties and gene-silencing efficiency of the LNPs [112,113]. It has been reported that the size of LNPs decreases as the proportion of the PEG-lipid conjugate in LNPs increases [31]. Increased PEG density on the surface of LNPs has been shown to reduce the immune response [114]. The structural differences in the length of PEG, fatty acids, and linker of the PEG-lipid conjugate used for modification of LNPs also strongly affect the potential of LNPs. LNPs modified with (R)-3-[(\u03c9-methoxy-PEG-carbamoyl)]-1,2-di-Ooctadecyl-sn-glyceride (C18) showed high blood retention but dramatically reduced gene-silencing effects in the liver [112,113]. This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes.

            "text": "As a result, the off-target side effects were reduced. It was also observed from various studies that for the treatment of brain cancer, LNPs were administered by oral, intravenous as well as intranasal delivery [156]. The cellular uptake of LNPs by the oral route was already mentioned in Section 2. Briefly, on oral and intravenous administration, the LNPs enters the lymphatic and systemic circulation respectively, after which it targets the brain cancer cells via active (ligand-mediated cellular internalization) or passive (general cellular uptake via EPR effect) targeting [157]. Similar route and the associated approaches were employed for targeting breast, pancreas, and prostate cancer cells [24,158]. During intranasal administration for brain targeting, the LNPs binds with the mucus layer, which were then taken up by the neurons and translocated in the nerve axons to enter into brain cells, where the LNPs get degraded by the enzymes and drugs get released [156]. LNPs also ensure distinct drug delivery to the lesion site of the colon and rectum for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Most of the LNPs employed for the treatment of colorectal cancer are via oral route. It was observed that the LNPs are absorbed from the intestinal lumen into the circulation of colorectal region through endocytosis or via carrier-mediated transport [159]. Similarly, for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), LNPs are presently under pre-clinical and clinical trials. Like other cancer types, most of the chemotherapeutics are administered orally or intravenously for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. It was observed that after administration of drug loaded LNPs, they non-specifically bind with the serum proteins leading to aggregation and opsonization, also causing a chance to get blocked within sinusoidal fenestrations. Therefore, to overcome the drawbacks, the LNPs were shielded with PEG, which provide shielding from plasma protein recognition as well as minimizing their sizes to <100 nm in order to cross the sinusoidal fenestrations. Moreover, liver targeting can be achieved by active or passive targeting [160].",

            "text": "The design and selection of organ-targeted LNPs should primarily prioritize effectiveness, stability, and safety. This is achieved by adjusting their physicochemical properties, including charge, size, pKa, etc. Besides, fine variations in the IL structure within LNPs, rather than relying on charge or ligand modifications, alter the overall delivery characteristics and facilitate precise targeting of specific organs and cells. 108 The structure of IL can be divided into three key components: head group, linker, and hydrophobic tail. \n\nThe head group of ILs typically carries a positive charge, which enhances the encapsulation of nucleic acids and promotes intracellular escape by improving interactions with negatively charged endosome membranes. Typical head groups include amines, ranging from primary to quaternary, guanidine, and various heterocyclic groups. 109 It is worth noting that ILs with different head group structures often exhibit varying pKa values. These pKa values determine the surface charge of LNPs and subsequently impact their ability to interact with diverse types of serum proteins, leading to discrepancies in distribution within the body. Notably, studies by Moderna have claimed that LNPs with a pKa range of 6.6-6.9 contribute to the induction of adaptive immune responses in the context of mRNA vaccines. Additionally, an optimal pKa range of 6.2-6.8 has been identified for achieving effective protein expression in the liver following intravenous delivery of LNPs. 110 Regarding organ-selective targeting, LNPs with a pKa range of 6-7 mainly accumulate in the liver. When the pKa exceeds 9, LNPs primarily reach the lungs, while LNPs with a pKa within 2-6 tend to accumulate in the spleen. 42 A study by Dan Peer and colleagues demonstrated that LNPs with piperazine head key lipids exhibited a greater tendency to accumulate in the spleen than in the liver, whereas LNPs with tertiary amine (F) GFP expression in fetal livers 24 h after injection with LNPs A-3.GFP.

Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands cou potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA 4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence fo the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-base therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a sho circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will im prove the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation tim is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetune by modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase th circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduce endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune r sponse [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated These results clearly show that LDV-LNPs associate with both VLA-4-positive immature and mature HSPCs resulting in higher LNP accumulation and longer retention in the bone marrow. Consequently, these findings strongly support the concept of augmented retain and improved uptake in leukemic cells including leukemic stem cells in vivo.",

            "text": "6.0); therefore, highly hydrophobic LNPs tend to aggregate at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A small amount of PEG modification increases LNP stability in the bloodstream and may not inhibit ApoE binding in the bloodstream. For example, Huang et al. prepared polymerlipid hybrid nanoparticles (P/LNPs) containing anti-VEGF siRNA [126]. Encapsulation of siRNA into these P/LNPs increased the amount of siRNA delivered into the cells. In addition, the circulation time of siRNA was significantly increased after systemic administration by encapsulation into the P/LNPs compared with that of free siRNA. The intravenous injection of P/LNPs into HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell-implanted mice significantly inhibited the tumor growth and decreased the amount of VEGF mRNA in the tumor. In their report, Huang et al. indicated that the increase in the amount of LNPs (siRNA) delivered into the tumor and a good level of safety make P/LNPs a hopeful approach for cancer therapy. To increase the amount of LNPs delivered into a tumor, Li et al. modified LNPs with a transferrin receptor-targeting ligand in addition to PEG [127]. Also, a CPP was incorporated into the LNPs to enhance their cell-penetration efficacy. These LNPs containing anti-survivin siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth after intravenous injection. Now, a large amount of PEG modification and active targeting systems developed by modification with ligand molecules such as peptides and antibodies have been used for the delivery of LNPs to other organs. By intravenous injection, Yamamoto et al. delivered siRNA in LNPs to prostate tumors in vivo by increasing the amount of PEG modification from 1% to 2.5 or 5%, resulting in inhibition of the growth of the implanted tumors [128]. We modified the LNP surface with HB-EGF antibody for the targeting of breast tumors [99,104]. HB-EGF is a ligand that binds to the EGF receptor (EGFR) [129]. It was reported that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; no estrogen receptor, pro",

            "text": "Unexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.",

            "text": "Despite having successfully identified the top four LNP formulations using the multi-step screening platform, the mechanism still remained unclear. Therefore, we proposed the following hypotheses: enhanced liver-targeting transfection is the result of (1) the tissue-specific biodistribution of LNPs, (2) the differential cellular uptake profiles of LNPs following distribution into the local tissue, and (3) the differential endosomal escape or DNA release abilities of LNPs, even between formulations with similar biodistribution and cellular uptake levels. \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we first examined the serum stability and biodistribution of the four top-performing LNPs at 6, 12, and 24 h after i.v. injection using Cy5-labeled pDNA. For comparison, we included two LNP formulations (DI-6 and FIII-1) that were less effective but possessed similar characteristics (size and zeta potential) to the topperforming ones (Supplementary Fig. 7). As Supplementary Fig. 8 showed, there was no significant difference between top-performing LNPs and low-performing ones observed in terms of size change in serum containing PBS. IVIS imaging showed that all six selected formulations, independent of transfection performance, had similar biodistribution profiles at all time points (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 9). In all cases, ~60% of LNPs were distributed to the liver at 6 h after i.v. administration. In addition, similar uptake levels by hepatocytes were seen for all six formulations, with flow cytometry assessment indicating that the high transfection by the top formulations was not caused by differences in biodistribution nor cellular uptake level (Fig. 6b). To verify that the transfection efficiency of LNPs was not related to biodistribution, we checked the transfection efficiency of six LNPs by administering the same dose of the six LNPs via intrahepatic injection. The results in Fig. 6c and d showed that although the same dosage was delivered to the liver, the local transfection efficiency was significantly different.",

The preparation temperature was affected by the PdI NP and surface PEG densities of the NPs (Figure 3). This was because the conformations of the PEG chains could be changed by temperature, as indicated by the DSC measurements (Figure 2). The PEG chain T m of the synthesized PDLA-PEG uni and PLLA-PEG uni were 48.0 \u2022 C and 46.4 \u2022 C, respectively (Figure 2A). Below the T m , PEG chains would not interact with the solvent, leading to unimer aggregation. When unimers were dissolved in DMF, the solution was clear and aggregates were not observed, even at 35 \u2022 C. When NPs were prepared at 35 \u2022 C, the PEG chains could be partially embedded in the PLA core. This could be the reason why NP prep35 \u2022 C showed polydisperse and sparse surface PEG densities. \n\nPrevious studies have reported that bulk PEG chain conformations in di-block copolymers change depending on their crystalline temperature [31,32].",

            "text": ". 97 As analyzed in vivo by Grenier et al. 98 on PEGylated liposomes and polymeric NPs, using anti-PEG antibodies can have a signi\ue103cant neutralizing effect. Comparing the corona formed in naive mice, the exact impact of these antibodies on PC was found. The changes were analyzed according to the Ig deposited on the surface of NPs from the serum of PLGA-PEG NPs (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))-sensitized animals. This also alters the deposition of PC as apolipoproteins were found to be deposited on the surface of PLGA-PEG NPs compared to free methoxy-PEG chains and poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PEG5k-PLGA). This might be relevant for nanomedicine given the implication of these proteins on the clearance of NPs in the bloodstream.\n\nA solution was proposed by Wang et al. 99 They suggested that adding a-glutamyl at the end of PEG should increase the circulating time of the polymeric micelles compared to bare PEG. Another challenge is the clearance of PEG-NPs as their accumulation in the spleen and the liver is signi\ue103cant. The work of Esposito et al. 100 shows a method to overcome this issue. The in vivo biodistribution in mice was regulated by mixing aminogroups and PEG on the surface of polycaprolactone NPs. The accumulation of NPs in lungs, spleen and liver was investigated, lungs being the targeted organ containing cancer cells (B16F10 cells). This NH 2 /PEG coating was compared with PEG-coated NPs and with a human albumin layer (NH 2 /PEG-NPs@HA).\n\nThe results indicate that NH 2 -NPs accumulate more in the lungs, than other NPs, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally hemolysis calculated for all the NPs were less than 20% and showed no effect in in vivo studies.",

            "text": "Having identified a common backbone in the structure of our lipids, we then performed structure-activity studies to explore how chemical modifications in specific moieties of these lipids could affect their extrahepatic delivery performance, particularly in their targeting to the lungs. \n\nHydrophobic tail regions are known to play a pivotal role in determining the LNP biodistribution, impacting factors such as lipid packing, LNP stability, and their cellular However, given the known influence of LNP surface charge on protein corona formation [12,29], we hypothesized that some of our ionizable lipids forming LNPs with zeta potential values outside the typical range for liver targeting might express preferentially in other organs. To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively re-evaluated these lipids, selecting the screened candidates that yielded LNPs with physicochemical properties deviating from the liver-targeting norms. We specifically focused on the zeta potential as this reflects the overall surface charge, which can influence interactions with serum proteins, the biodistribution, and passive organ targeting. \n\nThus, for this selection, we applied two criteria. First, we focused on LNPs with a zeta potential equal to or greater than \u22122 mV, inspired by previous findings that suggested that an increased surface charge could enhance lung targeting [10,12]. Second, we included LNPs that demonstrated strong protein expression, specifically those exceeding a total flux of 1 \u00d7 10 7 p/s in the original intramuscular screening, ensuring that only high-performing candidates were considered (chemical structures can be found in Figure S1). Additionally, we incorporated thirteen lipids that exhibited exceptionally high protein expression despite having more negative zeta potentials, allowing us to explore potential outliers with unique targeting properties (Figure 1B). \n\nAfter intravenous administration of LNPs formulated with the selected ionizable lipids and encapsulating luciferase mRNA, ex vivo analyses revealed that, while most of the selected ionizable lipids still showed liver tropism, eight of them demonstrated lung-selective expression exceeding 10% selectivity (Figure 1C,D).",

The resulting LNPs showed encapsulating efficiencies exceeding 90%, hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 70 to 110 nm, and a narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.3). No clear trends were observed in the LNP encapsulation efficiencies, sizes, or PDIs. However, significant variations in the LNP zeta potential were evident across different ionizable lipid structures, displaying positive, negative, and near-neutral values (Table S2). To evaluate the organ selectivity ex vivo, we defined organ-specific hit rates based on a 50% protein expression threshold. Consequently, an LNP was deemed organ-selective if at least 50% of its total expression occurred in a single organ (Figure 2D,E). Notably, 36.6% of the lipids demonstrated selectivity for lung tissue, highlighting that a significant proportion of the tested compounds effectively targeted pulmonary cells. Remarkably, our screening revealed that as few as 7.3% of the ionizable lipids tested demonstrated selectivity for hepatic tissue. This key finding establishes a foundation for developing novel strategies for extrahepatic delivery, particularly considering the liver's predominant role in mRNA-LNP biodistribution (Table S3). \n\nCloser examination of the chemical structures of the tested tails revealed that T1 derivatives barely achieved lung selectivity (only one ionizable lipid in that group; 2.4% hit rate), suggesting that a minimum level of branching is required to enhance targeting to lung tissue (Figure 2E). This lack of selectivity in T1 may also stem from the removal of one of the biodegradable beta-propionate linkages in its final structure, which could impact both its stability and biodistribution. In contrast, the branched thiolactone-sulfur derivatives (T2, T3, T4) were designed to contain eight carbons post-ester linkage, making them structural isomers and allowing us to assess how tail structures influence extrahepatic delivery.",

In contrast, 3 H-PEG-C14 exhibits a longer t 1/2 and greater blood AUC than the 14 C-MC3 (Figure 5b and Table 2), consistent with the movement of this lipid into the lipoprotein pool, where it remains in circulation for longer. Distribution out of the blood compartment for the three formulations correlates with concomitant accumulation in liver tissue (Figure 5c). PEG-C14 LNPs accumulate rapidly, reaching a maximum 55% of the injected dose at 4 hours.

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

[22]. \n\nThe third systemic delivery approach of note involves multicomponent complexes. Rozema et al. [23] studied particles composed of siRNA conjugated with a dynamic polyconjugate and complexed with PEG to extend t 1/2 , plus a liver targeting ligand, N-acetyl galactosamine (NAG). This strategy was successfully used in rodents and non-human primates to show potent and durable hepatic ApoB knockdown with associated reduction in circulating LDLc. Mechanistically, the role of NAG was crucial, as its replacement with mannose abrogated uptake by hepatocytes and instead directed delivery to other hepatic cellular compartments such as Kupffer cells. Bartlett et al. [24] used a similar multicomponent concept but complexed a ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2) siRNA to cationic cyclodextrin, along with PEG and a targeting ligand, transferrin. In this system, the transferrin allowed delivery to extrahepatic sites, and target mRNA knockdown was achieved in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft. \n\nOf the three hepatic delivery concepts above, the LNPmediated approach has received the most attention. Recently, optimization of LNP structure and function has resulted in potent in vivo knockdown at doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg [25] (whereas in local delivery (see above) doses are typically >1 mg/kg). LNP-mediated delivery of RNAi therapeutics has now been applied to several different target mRNAs other than ApoB and has been described in five species including the mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig and non-human primate [20,[25][26][27][28] (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., unpublished observations).",

The high organ uptake, yet the low expression of the luciferase transgene, following the administration of LNPs (Ambegia et al., 2005) suggests that >99% of the plasmid DNA is not expressed in vivo, and may be rapidly degraded within the lysosome compartment.

            "text": "The physical and chemical properties of NPs, including their size, morphology, surface charge, and surface chemical treatment (e.g., pegylation, ligand coupling) and composition, can significantly affect the kinetic behavior of drugs in vivo, their distribution in vivo, their penetration in tumor tissues, and the bioavailability of tumor cells. Each class of NPs exhibits unique properties as well as advantages and disadvantages of the characteristics (Table S2, you can see this form in the supplement file, reference [8,100,106,[118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125][126][127][128][129][130][131][132][133]). Due to the EPR effect, when the size of the NP is less than 5.5 nm, it is mainly filtered through the kidney, while when it is less than 50 nm, it interacts with liver cells and is metabolized from the liver [134]. During intravenous administration, NPs usually accumulate in the capillary bed, resulting in premature release of nanotherapeutic drugs at this site, leading to significant toxicity. When NPs are smaller than 20 nm, they usually accumulate more at the tumor site, but they are also rapidly filtered and excreted, resulting in reduced cycle time. However, when the size of NPs is greater than 200 nm, the complement system is activated and rapidly expelled from the circulation. The distribution of NPs at tumor sites is uneven, and the main reason affecting their biological distribution is the presence of uncomplexed free cationic polymers in the cationic formulation. Some scholars have demonstrated that liver GSH- mediated biotransformation can be used to regulate the biological interaction of NPs in order to maximize tumor targeting and reduce the accumulation of NPs in other sites [135].",

            "text": "Based on our in vivo structure-function analysis, we identified a top Pi-LNP, named LNP-A10 (Fig. 3a, b), which contains the ionizable lipid PPZ-A10, cholesterol, C 18 PEG 2K , and DOPE at a ratio of 35:46.5:2.5:16. To validate LNP-A10, we formulated it with Cre mRNA and injected it intravenously into Ai14 mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Mouse weights were monitored throughout the experiment, and no weight loss was observed (Supplementary Fig. 5). After three days, we isolated cells of interest and evaluated the percentage of tdTo-mato+ cells at the cell-type level (Fig. 3c). LNP-A10 successfully delivered Cre mRNA predominantly to (1) Kupffer cells, with 60% tdTomato+ cells observed, (2) spleen macrophages, with 50% tdTomato+ cells, and (3) spleen dendritic cells, with 30% tdTomato+ cells. We also observed 20% delivery to liver dendritic cells, while the delivery to liver endothelial cells was below 10%. To complement the tdTomato readouts, which quantify the functional delivery of mRNA, we measured the biodistribution of LNP-A10 using QUANT 49 , a sensitive digital droplet PCR-based method to quantify on-and off-target biodistribution (Fig. 3d). Once again, the distribution of LNP-A10 was found to be the highest in Kupffer cells, followed by spleen dendritic cells and macrophages, which was consistent with the functional delivery results we observed. We therefore concluded that LNP-A10 preferentially delivered nucleic acids to hepatic and splenic immune cells. \n\nNext, we performed an in vivo dose response to explore whether LNP-A10 delivered mRNA at 0.3 mg/kg, a clinically relevant dose 1 . We injected LNP-A10 including Cre mRNA at doses of 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg (Fig. 3e).",

            "text": "PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114]. mRNA-LNP formulations were developed using two short PEG-lipids (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) which quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum. On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.",

The responsive delivery using changes in pH, redox, and enzymes conditions at the site of the disease, as described in the previous three sections, is still limited by the fact that these responsiveness mostly originate from a microenvironmental or intracellular change, yet the basis of the disease mostly originates in an organ, and most of the current intravenous procedures for drug delivery enrich it in the liver, so a better solution is needed for drug delivery to extrahepatic tissues, where only reaching the target organ first is more effective in reducing peripheral side effects and better drug utilization [117,118]. Endogenous targeting is one of the goals of current scientific research and the future clinical field, that is, instead of using specific molecules to modify the carriers, the structure and ratio of the components of the carriers are adjusted so that it can selectively deliver proteins or small molecules to an organ or cell in the body [119,120]. \n\nWhile conventional LNP generally consists of four lipid components: ionizable cationic lipids, amphiphilic phospholipids, cholesterol, and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids [121,122], Cheng et al. analyzed that by adding a fifth lipid (SORT) to the components of conventional LNP and by adjusting the ratio of different SORT lipid components, they could change the organ targeting specificity of LNP in vivo and could enable the delivery of mRNA to organs other than the liver (Figure 10(a)) [123]. More importantly, this SORT-LNP can be extended to a variety of extrahepatic organs and tissues, enabling mRNA delivery to lung, kidney, spleen, and even epithelial cells and immune cells. They also considered that gene delivery requires endosomal escape to function in the cytoplasm, so they designed an iPhos phospholipid consisting of an ionizable amine head and three alkyl chains as a tail, based on the ability to specifically deliver to extrahepatic tissues, from which the LNP can effectively achieve organ-selective delivery and endosomal escape in target cells, with an in vivo efficiency of up to 965-fold compared to conventional LNP [84].",

            "text": "Here, it seemed that PS more potently accumulated in liver and spleen than PG. This can be explained by different phagocytosis rates and mechanisms, as PS can be engulfed by cells of the MPS and others, e.g., by hepatocytes [56] or fibroblasts, whereas PG is only phagocytized by monocytes and macrophages [56]. Furthermore, we previously observed PS being more potently engulfed than PG in vitro [42]. The variation in their phagocytosis activities may also explain the differences between the in vivo biodistribution profiles of PS and PG. For PG, it seemed that a time-dependent redistribution of the liposomes occurred, probably due to slower accumulation in the liver compared to PS. \n\nThe addition of PEG to anionic liposomal formulations did not result in prolonged liposome circulation in vivo, while ex vivo higher accumulation in the spleen was observed. PEGylation of negatively charged liposomal formulations is not common. One study by Levchenko et al. systematically investigated PS-enriched liposomes with different types of PEG, either PEG 750 or PEG 5000 [57]. There, they showed that addition of PEG 750 was not suitable to overcome the PS phagocytosis by cells of the MPS, whereas PEG 5000 containing PS liposomes revealed circulation duration comparable to liposomes lacking PS, resulting in a slight prolongation. This study is supported by Chiu et al., who, in addition to the characterization of the PEG chain length, also investigated the amount of PEG needed to overcome PS' recognition by the MPS [58]. They found that a content of 15% of PEG 2000 successfully reduced plasma protein interactions in liposomes containing 10% PS. In our case, we used PEG 2000, only marginal impacts on PS' or PG's biodistribution in vivo were observed. As we used 30% of anionic PLs, probably higher amounts of PEG are necessary, but this may raise further concern, e.g., liposome to micelle transition by PEG, as was described by Chiu [58]. Thus, we only used 5% of PEG 2000.",

            "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

            "text": "Release took place primarily at the EE/LE conversion step rather than from lysosomes. These studies provide important insights into the mechanistic basis of oligonucleotide delivery via LNPs and attest to the overall inefficiency and transience of oligonucleotide delivery even when using effective nanocarrier systems. \n\nAn important issue is whether it is possible to target LNPs to particular cells or tissues. An obvious approach is to decorate the LNP surface with antibodies. However, long experience with targeting of drug-loaded liposomes suggests that it is quite difficult to find the right balance between PEG shielding and availability of the antibody (183). Recently however, there have been some interesting reports using antibody-targeted siRNA LNPs. Thus a scFv was used to target LNPs to dendritic cells in vivo. Good 'knock down' of several co-stimulatory surface antigens and inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reactions were observed (184). In another study LNPs decorated with antibody to CD20 delivered Bcl-2 ASO to B-cell tumors in vivo with good antitumor effect (185). Additionally an anti CD4 monoclonal was used to target siRNA LNPs to CD4 positive T-cells resulting in knock-down of the intended mRNAs both in cell culture and in vivo (186). \n\nProgress has also been made using small molecule ligands to target LNPs. For example, in a series of publications, Huang et al. have used anisamide as a ligand to assist in the delivery of siRNA LNPs to tumors (187,188). Finally aptamers are also being explored as a targeted delivery approach for LNPs (189). Some of the above mentioned studies on LNP targeting are also of interest because they involve delivery of oligonucleotides to non-hepatic sites. \n\nFinally, there have been some impressive recent preclinical studies using LNPs. Thus LNPs prepared using a novel lipid from a chemical library selectively delivered oligonucleotides to the lung. When used with si-KRAS and miR-34a, significant inhibition of lung cancer was attained in a genetically engineered mouse tumor model (190).",

We explored a wide range of targeting ligand surface densities, evaluating a gradient from 0.15 to 1.2% of the 1.5% total PEG-lipid content, equivalent to 10 to 80% of total PEG (fig. S5A). LNPs with varying levels of ligand on surface were formulated with Cre mRNA and subsequently injected into Ai-9 mice. Unconjugated LNPs loaded with Cre-mRNA served as nontargeted baseline comparison in our studies. LNP characterization using dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) measured LNP size as 70 to 76 nm in diameter before peptide conjugation with a uniform polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.1 indicating a homogeneous preparation. After conjugation, LNP-MH42 conjugates displayed slightly higher diameters (71 to 87 nm) and an increased PDI likely due to the inclusion of peptides on their surface (Fig. 4B). mRNA encapsulation ranged between 95 and 99% for all LNPs ensuring almost complete encapsulation of cargo across all formulations tested irrespective of ligand conjugation amount (Fig. 4C). Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) of LNPs with and without peptides corroborated once again that LNP morphology was undisturbed by the conjugation strategy (Fig. 4, D to F). To quantify the amount of peptide conjugated on surface of nanoparticle, we used a fluorometric absorbance kit that detects free maleimide groups before and after conjugation. The calculated total amount (w/v) of peptide was 376 and 492 pg for 0.15 and 0.3% MH42 per microliter of LNP solution, respectively. \n\nAt 7 days after intravitreal or subretinal administration of LNPs with and without MH42, tdTomato expression was visualized in vivo with fundus imaging and postmortem with confocal microscopy of retinal cryosections.",

            "text": "Although the optimal amount of coadministered unlabelled EGF has not yet been established, coadministration does appear to offer an effective strategy for radiolabelled targeted nanosystems such as 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG, leading to enhanced tumour uptake and reduced liver accumulation. The coadministration of unlabelled targeting ligand rather than unlabelled NP (i.e. EGF-Au-PEG6000) reduces unnecessary hepatic accumulation of unlabelled NP. \n\nThe results from our study are consistent with those reported by Hu et al., who showed that pretreatment with unlabelled analogues caused an increase in uptake of 111 In-labelled EGF into EGFR-positive xenografts (from 1.08 to 2.37 %ID/g), with a reduction in liver uptake from 19.58 to 11.19 %ID/g [30]. The tumour uptake values in the current study were higher (2.81 and 3.91 %ID/g for 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 in the absence and presence of unlabelled EGF respectively). This is likely to be a result of the greater payload of radioactivity afforded by the NP delivery system, together with the prolonged circulation time due to the PEGylation. SPECT/CT images show that at 24 h p.i. radioactivity was present in the heart (Figure S6), indicating that PEGylated 111 In-EGF-Au NP were still in circulation at this time point. These results demonstrate that 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 NP can deliver radioactivity to tumours more efficiently than 111 In-labelled EGF. However, coadministration of unlabelled targeting ligand led to higher kidney uptake of the NP, which was also observed in the pretreatment strategy for 111 In-labelled EGF [29,30]. Further work is needed to explore strategies to reduce NP uptake in kidney. Accumulation of drugs, including NP-based medicines, in normal tissues may cause undesirable side effects. In some cases additional agents can be used to help reduce such accumulation.",

For instance, Li et al. developed LNPs encapsulating plasmids carrying circUGP2, successfully targeting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in mice and confirming its anti-tumor effects [49]. This LNP strategy shows considerable potential for clinical applications but also presents specific challenges. \n\nBuilding on this approach, we developed LNPs encapsulating sh-circPHF14 plasmids and validated their anti-tumor efficacy in a PDX model. However, achieving efficient targeted delivery of LNPs continues to be a significant challenge. Our next step is to optimize LNPs by modifying their surface with ligands to enhance their targeting specificity in tumor models [50]. Further validation of LNP-sh-circPHF14's efficacy in treating PDAC is necessary. Consequently, we should validate its effectiveness in additional xenograft models to establish a safe and effective anti-tumor strategy for PDAC. \n\nIn conclusion, our study advances the understanding of PDAC tumorigenesis and progression and may offer novel therapeutic targets and strategies for PDAC patients.",

            "text": "The highly specific liver localization most likely results from the permeability of the capillaries in this organ, which exhibit no lamina propria and 100-200 nm channels along the endothelial wall [68]. A similar observation was described using poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the polymer and adsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI) as the cationic molecule on the surface to obtain positively charged PLGA nanoparticles. These 200 nm cationic particles accumulate in the liver and spleen after intravenous administration for at least 24 h [69]. The sustained accumulation of NP T-B in the liver is important for achieving therapeutic effects with a few doses, which is highly desired in a clinical setting. In the liver, autophagy induction has been shown to be beneficial for hepatocytes, Kupffer macrophages and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), while in stellate cells, it is believed to be fibrinogenic [70]. Given the low population of stellate cells in the liver [71], induction of autophagy in the whole liver is most likely beneficial. To elucidate in greater detail which organs are targeted by fluorescent NP and NP T-B, we isolated the major organs in the 24 h following a single IV injection. While NP accumulated mainly in the liver 24 h after IV injection, NP T-B accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen, in both models. The difference in the organ biodistribution is most likely due to the difference in the surface charge of NP and NP T-B. To further promote liver targeting and avoid spleen accumulation, galactosyl or folate or transferrin could be co-adsorbed on the NP T-B surface to facilitate active liver targeting. Co-adsorption of peptide or proteins has been reported before on such PLA particles, for example by p24 and RGD proteins on PLA NPs, for vaccine development purposes [72].",

            "text": "PK and BD data for siRNA LNPs indicate that the mechanism of LNP removal from the circulation does not exhibit the same PEG-lipid threshold effect as seen for hepatic gene silencing. At 1.5 mol % PEG-lipid the circulation half-life of 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs (estimated over 24 hours) for PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 LNPs is 0.64, 2.18, and 4.03 hours respectively. There is also a marked decrease in liver and spleen uptake with increasing chain length. These data indicate that both 1.5 mol % PEG-C16 and -C18 steric barriers reduce the association of opsonins with LNPs in the circulation. The reason for the different PEG effects for opsonin induced clearance and Apo E-mediated uptake are not known at this time, but may reflect the molecular weights of the various proteins involved and their ability to penetrate a low density PEG shield. \n\nDespite the differences in liver uptake between LNPs containing 1.5 mol % PEG-C14 and PEG-C18 they exhibit similar gene silencing activities, indicating that delivery to the liver alone is not a limiting factor for activity under these dosing conditions. As might be expected, a comparison of 14 C-MC3 to 3 H-PEG-lipid in liver shows that the amount of 3 H-label taken up reflects the rates of transfer to lipoproteins and erythrocytes while LNPs are in the circulation (Figure 5c,d). However, it is interesting to note that by 24 hours, >50% of the 3 H-PEG-C14 accumulated in the liver at 2 hours has been eliminated whereas the concentration of 3 H-PEG-C18 remains constant. The 3 H-label is located in the alkyl chains, which are joined to the headgroup by metabolically stable ether linkers. 17 Consequently, the differences in liver processing between the short and long chain PEG-lipids may also be related to lipid transfer rates and perhaps reflect PEG-C14 excretion into bile rather than metabolism.",

            "text": "The liver tropism limitation of conventional LNPs substantially drives the development of non-hepatic organ-and specific cell type-targeted LNPs by surface engineering with various targeting ligands. Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles to sufficiently deliver their nucleic acid cargo inside the cells of interest [49,54,65,67] PEGylation is a widely used method for preventing rapid nanoparticle clearance and increasing in vivo circulation time [49]. For example, in Doxil \u00d2 , which delivers the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (Dox), including PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) extends circulation time [17]. By increasing circulation time, these well-anchored PEGlipids on the surface of Doxil \u00d2 -liposomes boost Dox accumulation at the tumor site [17] and decrease cardiotoxicity, as compared to free doxorubicin [68,69]. However, the generally high stability and stealth-like properties of PEGylated liposomes limit the cellular interactions that can lead to low cellular uptake and poor endosomal escape [70], an outcome that is counter-productive for nucleic acid delivery. Therefore, while particle stabilization with persistent PEG-lipids is helpful during formation and for extending circulation times, it creates a paradox known as the PEG dilemma [14,51,65,67,71] wherein improved accumulation outside the liver corresponds with reduced particle activity [49].\n\nThe short chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG) is introduced in the Onpattro \u00d2 formulation (Fig. 3A) to do 'the exact opposite' to what the PEG-DSPE is facilitating. While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver.

This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes. The length of fatty acid chains of the PEG lipid is responsible for the time of dissociation from the LNPs. Since PEGylated lipids with myristoyl (C14) chains are rapidly dissociated from the LNPs in the blood circulation, they do not interfere the process of FVII knockdown. We previously showed in mice that long circulation of siRNA-loaded pH-sensitive liposomes modified with PEG was observed only when DSPE-PEG but not distearoylglycerol (DSG)-PEG was used. Our results suggest that the electrostatic interaction between lipid molecules on the surface of the liposomes is a critical determinant for the in vivo effect of PEGylation [115].\n\nPEGylation of LNPs and chemical modification of siRNA reduce their immunogenicity, but it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of immune reactions, especially in susceptible individuals [116]. Recently, Chen et al. reported that incorporation of a small amount (4 mol% of total lipid content) of dexamethasone into LNPs can suppress the immune response [117]. Such an approach provides a positive perspective for future clinical trials and commercialization.",

            "text": "The conjugation of NPs with PEG impacts the biodistribution of NPs by enhancing the efficacy of systemic delivery [74].PEG is a hydrophilic molecule which provides a shield that prevents the interaction of circulating NPs with other blood components, thereby reducing opsonization and phagocytosis, which lead to their clearance from circulation [74].Hence, PEGylation reduces uptake of NPs by the reticuloendothelial system and increases the probability of NPs reaching the BBB to interact with the brain endothelium.An added advantage of PEGylation is that it can act as a linker for ligand molecules to achieve active targeting to the brain [75].These ligands include transferrin that binds to transferrin receptors on brain endothelial cells, lactoferrin that targets lactoferrin receptors, and other BBB-targeting peptides like arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD), which target \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin receptors [75].Furthermore, PEGylation of NPs potentially decreases their neurotoxicity.In a study, lipid NPs were shown to induce neurovascular damage when injected into THY1-YFP transgenic mice via activation of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 [76].PEGylation of lipid NPs abrogated P2X-caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 signaling in microglia, which reduced neuroinflammation and neurovascular damage [76].Conjugating peptides with NPs enables them to bind to receptors and other proteins expressed on BBB endothelial cells, facilitating penetration of the BBB [77].Typical examples of peptides targeting receptors that have been used in brain disorders include the RGD peptide targeting \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 -integrin, which is highly expressed on tumor tissues [78].",

            "text": "Several studies have reported that LNPs could elicit systemic effects such as accumulation in the liver, even when administered intramuscularly [28][29][30][31]. We had similar observations by in vivo imaging, in which both HLV and IM administration of LNP resulted in immediate and abundant luciferase signals in the liver up to 24 h (Figure 2A). In contrast, no signals were detected in the nanomicelle group. Based on these findings, we conducted luciferase assays on the liver and kidney that were collected 24 h after the injection, since the liver and the kidneys are the major organs of drug metabolism and excretion. Luciferase expression in the liver after both IM and HLV LNP injections was almost 10,000-fold higher than that of the noninjected controls (Figure 3A), confirming off-target mRNA expression in the liver cells delivered by LNP. Additionally, luciferase expression was also found in the kidney of mice receiving LNP, although the signals were much milder in the HLV group than the IM group and were not statistically significant (Figure 3B). Meanwhile, no luciferase expression was detected in the liver or kidney of mice injected with nanomicelle. In addition, since the signals were close to background levels at the end of the in vivo imaging experiment, we collected the muscle samples 2 weeks after the injection, and examined the FLuc expression by luciferase assay. Correspondingly, higher expression was observed in the group treated with nanomicelle via HLV administration (Figure 2C). These data imply that although LNP resulted in significantly higher expression initially, polyplex nanomicelle led to relatively sustained expression after administration.",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, there are many barriers to extrahepatic delivery of NPs, which makes in vivo gene delivery to immune cells that reside in lymphoid organs like the spleen and lymph node very challenging. Upon intravenous injection, the serum protein ApoE often adsorbs to the surface of LNPs, thereby directing these particles to the liver. [34] Additionally, many PNP complexes show poor stability in serum, which in turn hinders their efficacy. [35] To mitigate these endogenous barriers to passive immune cell targeting, a variety of NP engineering approaches have been employed to functionalize these biomaterials with different targeting ligands specific to a variety of immune cells, including antibodies, different types of sugars, and other macromolecules that interact with receptors on specific immune cells. Here, these broad classes of active targeting ligands are discussed. Additionally, the major challenges associated with ligand-mediated targeting are outlined, highlighting the need for alternative engineering strategies to address these shortcomings.",

            "text": "LNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Another recent study shows that the type of sterol used also influences LNP structure and function [42]. In particular, the use of b-sitosterol induced a faceted LNPs surface and resulted in higher intracellular uptake, retention and transfection efficacy than the other analogues. The authors hypothesized that the presence of defects on the surface of b-sitosterol LNPs facilitated fusion with the endosomal membrane. Finally, a slight change in the inner structure of the core occurred as measured by SAXS, as expected, since the core contains sterols to some extent (see previous section and Figure 3g). The use of PEGylated lipids in LNP formulations raises some concerns about activity and safety. For example, PEGylation can accelerate blood clearance through the formation of anti-PEG antibodies, which are increasingly found in healthy population due to the high probability of exposure to PEG-containing product [43,44]. To prevent the disadvantages of PEGylation, efforts are being made to replace this molecule while keeping its essential function. Among these, polysarcosinylated (pSar) lipid was reported to improve safety profile of LNPs and maintain the same in vitro and in vivo effects [45]. LNPs containing pSar lipids mirrored the properties of LNP containing PEGylated lipids: LNP particle size decreased with increasing pSar headgroup and pSarlipid molar ratio, and longer pSar headgroup disrupted the internal order (at lower molar ratios than PEGylated lipids though). The in vitro and in vivo performance of the LNPs showed a similar protein expression for PEGlipid and pSar-lipid, while the safety profile improved for LNPs containing pSar-lipid. Another category of molecules to explore in the future is polyoxazolines, for example, which have been used for other type of NPs instead of PEGylated lipids.",

Fig. 9 shows that after the high peaking of CH3O-PEG-ALK-SH-GNP at 0.25 hr in the blood, it started to decrease gradually from the circulation and increase in other tissues with insignificantly higher concentrations reported in the liver 24 hr after injection. These findings may be attributed to the surface PEGylation of GNPs at the time of injection which might have caused the shielding of nanoparticles from being identified and uptaken by organs like the liver and the spleen which are the main organs concerned with the removal of colloids from the body. In addition, the negative charge of those nanoparticles might have contributed to impeding opsonization [54]. This supports that the small percentage of nanoparticles reported up to 6 hr after injection in the liver and spleen are mainly due to the hepatobiliary elimination rather than to the capture of particles by Kupffer cells. Whereas, the significant decrease in CH3 O-PEG-ALK-SH-GNP concentration in the blood and subsequent increase in the liver, spleen, and kidneys after 24 h might be due to the desorption and removal of PEG moieties away from the GNPs' surfaces followed by opsonization of the non PEGylated GNPs (i.e. unspecific adsorption of negatively charged proteins) [55]. This phenomenon is expected to lead to a large increase in the particles' size resulting in an increased uptake of the large nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system especially the liver and spleen [56,57]. 10.",

            "text": "This LNP selectively adsorbs plasma proteins following intravenous injection and specifically edits liver macrophages to enhance phagocytosis and initiate immune responses within tumors, thereby effectively halting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [131]. As a pivotal nanocarrier system, LNPs offer numerous advantages, including a simple structure, versatile compositions, and notable benefits [132][133][134][135]. The efficiency of drug loading and targeted release is influenced by the adjustment of lipid composition and structure, which enhances drug bioavailability and efficacy. LNPs also exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, rarely causing immune or toxic reactions. Despite the widespread use of LNPs in drug delivery, especially in gene therapy and vaccine development, their immunogenicity remains a concern. LNP formulations, particularly those used for mRNA vaccines, have been shown to trigger inflammatory responses. These immune responses can vary based on the composition of the lipids, with some ionizable lipids being more immunogenic than others [136]. Modifying lipid structures or incorporating additional excipients to reduce immunogenicity is an ongoing area of research aimed at improving the clinical safety profile of LNP-based therapies [137]. Targeting can be improved by modifying surfactants or lipid molecules, reducing drug toxicity to normal tissues, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. The size, shape, and surface properties of LNPs can be precisely tailored to meet various drug requirements through adjustments in formulation and processing conditions. Recent advancements in LNP technology have focused on the development of new lipid materials to enhance stability and functionality. For instance, the incorporation of ionizable lipids in LNPs has dramatically improved the efficiency of nucleic acid delivery by facilitating endosomal escape. Additionally, functionalizing the LNP surface with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, enables precise targeting of specific cell types, further enhancing therapeutic potential. PEGylation (the attachment of polyethylene glycol chains) is another widely used strategy to extend the circulation time of LNPs in vivo by reducing their recognition by the immune system [138].",

In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "PEG-lipids have a significant impact on the key characteristics of LNPs, which include particle size and polydispersity [156], the stability of LNPs during preparation and in storage, the prevention of aggregation [157], the encapsulation efficiency of nucleic acids, circulation half-life, immune response, in vivo distribution and efficiency in transfection [158,159]. The PEG-lipids used in Comirnaty \u00ae , Spikevax \u00ae and in Onpattro \u00ae are ALC-0159, PEG-DMG and PEG-c-DMG, respectively. The biological activity of LNPs is impacted by the structure of the lipid tail in PEG-lipids. Incorporation of PEG-lipids into the LNP membrane occurs through the hydrophobic tail (composed of alkyl/acyl chains). PEG-lipids possessing longer tails exhibit reduced propensity for dissociation from the LNP. Mui et al. demonstrated that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, analyzed one hour after administering them in vivo, was 45% for PEG-lipids containing C14 dialkyl chains, and conversely PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains displayed only 1.3% and 0.2% desorption, respectively [160]. The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro \u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails enable them to desorb from LNPs, allowing the particles to adsorb apoE, facilitating LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver [32]. PEG-lipids serve to stabilize LNPs during their preparation and storage by creating a steric barrier that facilitates self-assembly and inhibits aggregation. Moreover, the specific type of PEG-lipid used has an influence on the circulation time of LNPs and their interactions with cells.",

The resolution of these problems will expand the application of mRNA vaccines to a greater extent. \n\n4.1. LNP Targeting. When LNPs are injected intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), a majority of the LNPs accumulate in the liver, which contradicts the original intention of achieving the function of mRNA vaccines. Researchers are attempting to modify LNPs to alter organ targeting preferences. \u221299 Research on LNP targeting has become a global research hotspot. \u2212102 4.1.1. Modifications Made to Achieve Immune Organ Targeting. Recent studies have shown that changing the apparent acid dissociation constant (pK a ) of LNPs can enable LNPs to target extrahepatic tissues (such as the spleen or lungs). 103 The pK a of LNPs enriched in the liver is generally between 6 and 7; when the pK a is between 2 and 6, LNPs exhibit good spleen enrichment ability. 104 The surface pK a \u2248 5.7 of spleen-targeted OF-Deg-Lin FLuc mRNA LNPs also provides a good example. 105 The above phenomenon may be due to the different head groups of different ionizable cationic lipids determining the pK a , which determines the surface charge difference of LNPs, affects their ability to interact with different types of serum proteins, and ultimately leads to their different distributions in the body. The negative surface charge of LNPs is related to their uptake in the spleen. 106 Cheng et al. recently found that the presence of a fifth component, called \"selective organ targeting (SORT)\", can alter the organ targeting effect of LNPs in vivo. 107 Studies have shown that SORT lipids can affect the apparent pK a values of LNPs and the interaction between LNPs and serum proteins. Changing the quantity and type of SORT lipids can endow LNPs with different targeting selectivities. Interestingly, when the lipid 18PA, which has a negative surface charge, is added to LNPs, spleen targeting can be achieved.",

            "text": "Moreover, PEGylation of LNP due to high water uptake creates a steric barrier around the LNP, which prevents the aggregation of LNP and inhibits LNP from reticuloendothelial system (RES) recognition. Despite these advantages, PEG plays a double-edged sword role. It inhibits the conversion of the bilayer to hexagonal form and eliminates targeted cellular uptake due to biodistribution reduction. Thus, PEGylation prolongs the circulation half-life, improves transfection efficiency and bioavailability, and decreases MQ uptake of LNP [95][96][97][98]. Following the first administration, the secretion of anti-PEG-IgM, which is responsible for the accelerated blood clearance (ABC), results in the more rapid clearance of LNP [99,100]. Similarly to Cruz-Leal group researches which PC lipids had directly activated B-1 cells to induce natural IgM [78,79], recently it demonstrated that interaction between B-1 cells and LNP leads to anti-PEG IgM response, both humoral responses being critical in driving the clearance of the LNP from the blood and into the MPS of the lymphoid (and other) tissues. Extending these findings to other delivery technologies that might similarly be subject to natural IgM opsonization is tempting. For instance, gene therapies often rely on viral vectors that include repeating PC-like epitopes and other oligonucleotide therapeutics that use LNP like those described in this study [15,40].",

We next sought to specifically characterize which process(es) and compartment(s) in the PBPK model (and corresponding physiological processes) can distinguish drug clearance to the highest degree between cohorts of mice with and without APA. \n\nEvidence suggests that the systemic clearance of PL and small immune complexes, such as PL bound to APA, is predominantly liver-mediated (Ganesan et al. 2012;Ishida et al. 2005;McSweeney et al. 2018), in good agreement with our experimental (Fig. S.3) and model findings that the organ with greatest PL accumulation over time is the liver. To explore this in greater detail, we focused simulations on the parameters responsible for controlling the extent of drug exposure and retention in the liver: the liver permeability fraction, fr li , and the retention coefficient, Kp li . Together, the parameters fr li and Kp li control total drug in the liver. We used the model to explore how APA alter the role of fr li and Kp li , contributing mechanistically to the increased liver accumulation. \n\nWe considered the concentration of PL in the liver as a measurement of percent injected dose per gram liver tissue (%ID/g). We measured uptake one hour postinjection, consistent with the early-phase redistribution of the liposomes and the available data for continuous PET/CT scanning. We conducted a parameter sweep for liver-specific fr and Kp, through the widest region searched with LHS, while fixing the other parameters at the average of their optimized values (generating the prediction with the lowest least-squares error) for representative na\u00efve and APA+ mice according to the characteristic LHS runs, and thus generated a space of simulated liver uptake in an \"average mouse\" for each cohort 1 h after liposome injection (Fig. 3). Here, we visualize LHS-identified parameter ranges for liver permeability (fr li ) and retention (Kp li ), and the LHS-identified best-fit values of both liver parameters from the experimental data over 1 h for naive and APA+ mice.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary region where mRNA NPs tend to accumulate upon intravenous administration, which can be attributed to three main factors. First, the liver's hemodynamics and unique sinusoidal fenestrated capillary structure increase the likelihood of mRNA NPs being captured by the liver. Second, the liver serves as the primary site for the metabolic clearance of mRNA nanoparticles, resulting in a significantly higher distribution of nanomaterials in the liver than in other organs. Lastly, due to the high expression of ApoE receptors in the liver, systemically administered mRNA NPs readily adsorb ApoE, leading to preferential liver accumulation. Therefore, the primary challenge in successfully delivering mRNA NPs to extrahepatic organs like spleen and lungs is overcoming the liver homing tendency of mRNA NPs. \n\nVarious approaches are employed to target mRNA NPs to extrahepatic organs, such as incorporating stealth components into mRNA NPs, with PEG being the most widely used stealth element to avoid liver uptake. Additionally, by modulating the physicochemical properties of mRNA NPs, such as size, pKa, charge, or adding active targeting ligands, different organs can be targeted. Moreover, for specific organs like the lungs or brain, selecting appropriate delivery routes can greatly enhance the targeting efficiency of mRNA NPs. Notably, some recent studies have achieved extrahepatic targeting by directly inducing the adsorption of other plasma proteins. Alternative stealth shells to PEG, such as poly(adenine), poly(2-oxazoline), and poly(amino acids), have been proposed to circumvent the side effects of PEG-specific antibody responses and PEG's non-biodegradability. The extrahepatic targeted mRNA NP development provides valuable insights into overcoming liver homing tendencies, which contribute to design novel nanocarriers for other organs and cells.",

We next tested LNPs for in vivo evaluation in a xenotransplantation model of t(8;21) AML. To gain insight into the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the LNPs, we labelled LNPs with SulfoCyanine7.5, a dye compatible with in vivo imaging, using a click-chemistry approach (Fig. 5a). Conjugation of the dye to the LNP-PEG moieties did not substantially affect the physicochemical parameters of the particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 75 nm and a PDI of 0.2 ( Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Using the labelled LNPs, we first investigated the biodistribution of the nanoparticles in C;129S4-Rag2 tm1.1Flv Il2rg tm1.1Flv /J (RG) mice. Since previous reports showed that the liver retains LNPs larger than 50 nm in diameter [9,48], we performed three sequential injections of unlabelled LNPs (3 mg/kg) prior to intravenous injection of the labeled LNP/NIR (1 mg /kg) and subsequent in vivo fluorescence imaging. In this setting, treatment did not cause any adverse effect in RG mice and significant LNP-associated fluorescence was found in several organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and heart (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Importantly, we found substantial accumulation of LNPs in the spine, long bones and, to a lesser extent, in the brain (Fig. 5c). These experiments confirmed that the nanoparticles have a global body distribution in vivo and the potential capability of reaching leukaemic cell reservoirs.\n\nWe then investigated whether LNPs accumulate in leukaemic tissues. To that end we intrahepatically transplanted RG mice with luciferase-expressing Kasumi-1 cells and monitored engraftment by bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 5d).

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, we demonstrated that the fusion of EV and LNP enabled the loading of a sufficient number of barcodes to the hEVs allowing us to investigate the biodistribution of these particles in vivo. \n\nIn this study, we chose to employ the MC3 ionizable lipid in our LNP formulation due to its extensive documentation and well-established status, making it a reliable benchmark even in the face of newer lipids emerging for LNP composition. [20] However, it is important to note that MC3 LNPs tend to accumulate primarily in the liver, [21] posing a potential challenge for achieving effective extrahepatic delivery. Implementation of LNPs with lipids with \"neutral\" biodistribution may lead to a less biased assessment of delivery outcomes. Additionally, pegylation of EVs is known to affect their biodistribution, [22] which provides opportunities for engineering extrahepatic hEVs by incorporating LNPs with relevant PEG-lipids. These aspects might open up new avenues for future research to optimize and tailor hEV biodistribution for specific therapeutic applications. \n\nThe use of NGS techniques was also instrumental in achieving high sensitivity in the detection of hEVs in tissue samples. We detected DNA barcodes corresponding to particles injected at 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mg kg \u22121 or higher dose, which means that for ESC and HL-60 hEVs (10 \u22125 mg kg \u22121 ) were not retrieved. Going forward, one of the possible solutions to increase the sensitivity of the assay is to perform deeper sequencing, which can be easily implemented. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the barcodes are degraded or ended up in the tissues that were not examined, or that particles were phagocytized by immune cells in the blood and therefore were not able to reach target organs. Future studies are needed to examine these possibilities and further optimize the system. \n\nImportantly, our results are in general agreement with the existing literature. 10c,23] Interestingly, we discovered that hEVs originated from HAP1 cells displayed lung tropism. To eliminate the possibility that lung tropism was driven by aggregation, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of the lung tissues.",

            "text": "We started by defining our LNP formulation details based on previously published studies where siAR-LNPs were systematically administered to mice engrafted with prostate cancer tumors (Quick et al., 2022;van der Meel et al., 2021). The siRNA-LNPs we prepared were composed of D-Lin-MC3-DMA / Cholesterol / DSPC / PEG-DMG, with molar percentages of 50 / 37.5 / 10 / 2.5, respectively. After successful characterization of siRNA-LNPs by size (~70 nm diameter), polydispersity index (< 0.3), zeta potential (~neutral), and siRNA encapsulation efficiency (> 99 %) (Table S1), we decided to validate, as a proof of concept, whether our siAR-LNPs could knock down the AR gene in vitro, both at the mRNA (Fig. 1a) and protein levels (Fig. 1b), in two prostate cancer cell lines that express the AR wild type (PC346C and LNCaP). Both the levels of AR mRNA (Fig. 1a) and AR protein (Fig. 1b) were significantly reduced in PC346C (77 % mRNA knockdown) and LNCaP (71 % mRNA knockdown) upon treatment with PEG-DMG siAR-LNPs, compared to PEG-DMG non-targeting siRNA LNPs (siNT-LNPs). This demonstrated the efficacy of the siRNA. The PEG-DMG formulation has been developed for liver applications, whereas the inclusion of PEG with longer lipid tails has been shown to decelerate liver uptake (Mui et al., 2013b), which could favor extrahepatic applications. Therefore, we also assessed AR mRNA levels in LNCaP cells 24 h after treatment with the same formulation, but replacing PEG-DMG for PEG-DSG. We observed a 31 % mRNA knockdown (Fig. S1). Although this formulation showed less AR gene silencing in vitro, it has been previously reported that LNPmediated RNA delivery in vitro poorly predicts in vivo delivery ( Paunovska et al., 2018).",

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is hydrophilic polymer and when attached on the NPs, PEG chains cover the surface of NP. Thanks to the steric hindrance effect by PEG chains, the interaction of NPs and proteins/cells can be reduced and half-life in blood circulation is prolonged [79]. Such strategies can be applied to EVs for improving pharmacokinetics. \n\nOne paper described the PEGylation of EVs [85]. PEG chains were conjugated on the surface of EV via lipid anchor. PEGylated EVs showed longer half-life in blood circulation. However, unexpectedly, significant tumor accumulation of EVs was not observed. This is probably due to the detachment of PEG chains during circulation. Rational and robust conjugation for PEG chain rather than lipid anchoring is necessary for stable PEGylation and improving pharmacokinetics of EVs. -A) is responsible for uptake of EVs by macrophages in vivo. By utilizing this finding, they blocked SR-A by injecting dextran sulfate and reduced liver clearance of EVs [23]. Similarly, Matsumoto et al. reported that pre-injection of liposome composed of PS or phosphatidylglycerol prolonged the circulation time of EVs upon systemic administration [83]. These strategies are valuable to improve pharmacokinetics of EVs and facilitate targeted delivery to specific cells or organs.",

One compound, known as IDD-3, was formulated with three additional lipid components to enable lung-selective mRNA delivery. Interestingly, compounds that share the same degree of polymerization and lactone monomer as IDD-3, differing in only the choice of the amino-alcohol building block, no longer target the lung.\n\nLess progress has been made using active targeting strategies to the lungs. Although both peptide and monoclonal antibody ligands have been tested in vivo, they have only demonstrated the capacity for transfecting lung endothelial cells, necessitating the development of targeting ligands for other cell types of the lungs. The utility of the GALA peptide, designed to mimic the haemagglutinin protein of influenza virus, has been studied as a lung-targeting ligand for the delivery of siRNA and pDNA in vivo by LNPs 186,187 . Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies directed against platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) 188 or plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein 1 (PV1) 189 can be conjugated to the PEG lipid component of LNPs to deliver mRNA to the pulmonary endothelium. Interestingly, the functional delivery of luciferase mRNA to the lungs by anti-PECAM-1-modified LNPs is not impacted by the genetic knockout of ApoE in mice, reinforcing that ApoE-independent mechanisms are involved in extrahepatic targeting 188 . Despite the acquired capacity to target the lungs through the inclusion of these active targeting ligands, off-target delivery still occurs to the liver and the spleen; as is the case with GalNAc ligands, preventing protein corona formation through denser and more stable PEG shells may help to reduce this off-target delivery.",

            "text": "an intermediate near-neutral net charge [153]. Consistent with the above findings, highly positive LNPs targeted the lungs and highly negative LNPs targeted the spleen, while intermediate charge levels predominantly targeted the liver. Liver targeting has been shown to depend on Apo-E binding to near-neutral liposomes or LNPs [154], which does not occur for negatively charged liposomes [155].\n\nNotably, all of the above charge-mediated targeting studies have been done using IV administration and the routes typically used for vaccination, such as the intramuscular or intradermal routes, have not been examined. Most studies that analyze expression after intramuscular injection do, however, detect the systemic trafficking of mRNA LNPs, which are rapidly and strongly expressed in the liver, at the same time as they are expressed in muscle and draining lymph nodes [97,156,157]. These particular LNPs therefore seem to enter the vasculature and are subsequently expressed in liver hepatocytes due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting, which is not surprising since they were designed for hepatocyte targeting. This systemic distribution and expression of immunogens could, however, generate systemic cytokines, complement activation and lead to other potential undesirable effects that could amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events and/or impair immune response generation. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with ligand-mediated targeting of LNPs. Lung endothelial cell targeting was achieved by conjugating CD31 (PECAM) antibodies to the LNP and injecting intravascularly [158]. The liver hepatocyte-directed LNP then became largely redirected to the lung. A similar approach using a VCAM ligand successfully targeted LNPs to inflamed regions of the brain and alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [159]. Dendritic cells in vitro were also more efficiently transfected using a mannosylated liposome, which may be a strategy applicable to vaccination [160]. Higher throughput screening methods to identify ligands targeting specific cell types have also been developed and may be applicable for the targeting of specific dendritic cell subsets [161",

            "text": "Although alternative strategies are proposed, like cleavage of a PEG moiety (72), this problem is majorly addressed by a strategy based on \"reversible PEGylation\", where a lipid-containing PEG slowly detaches from the NP surface once administered. This allows to take advantage of the disposing of the high PEG concentration needed for small and monodisperse synthesis and distribution, and the lower PEG concentration needed to have a good cellular uptake at the moment when the NP reaches the target organ. Note that an increase in the concentration of PEG also influences its conformation and protective effects, increasing the circulation time of the iLNPs (71). Indeed, a completely PEG-covered iLNP surface will dramatically inhibit the interaction with cells and serum proteins, modifying circulation time and biodistribution (68,71). Such PEG-lipids remain integrated into the LNP structure during formation and under storage conditions, but in the presence of a lipid sink like in plasma, these PEG-lipids are stripped off the particle and into de medium, leaving the surface of the iLNP gradually unshielded (45). These PEG-lipids have short alkyl chains -which act as \"hydrophobic anchors\"-allowing a reasonable desorption rate once they enter blood circulation (71). The proper balance between a fully protected surface for iLNP synthesis and distribution, and a relatively unshielded surface for interactions with cell membranes, is achieved by finding a compromise between alkyl chain length and PEG-lipid surface concentration. \n\nSpecial mention deserves the interaction of NPs with proteins, adjusted by the size and concentration of PEG at the NP surface. When NPs are administrated into the body, they first interact with biological fluids. Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73).",

An even lower liver accumulation is observed for the 3 H-PEG-C14, consistent with the rapid dissociation of this molecule from circulating LNPs as discussed above (Figure 3a).

These lipids have identical structures including ether linkages between the alkyl chains and headgroup that are resistant to hydrolysis. 17 Therefore, these data suggest that the rate of PEG-lipid elimination from liver tissue may depend on its hydrophobicity and ability to interact with biological membranes. When uptake is expressed in grams lipid/gram of tissue, the spleen removes equivalent amounts of LNPs as liver. However, the spleen is smaller and therefore distribution to this organ typically accounts for <10% of the injected dose.

PNs accumulated in the tumor tissue at 1 h post-injection and remained in the tumor area for 24 h ( Fig. 1 A). Organs were harvested 24 h post-injection and visualized by fluorescent imaging ( Fig. 1 B). This indicated that PNs were mainly captured, metabolized, and cleared by the liver because of the stronger signal in the liver. Among the four groups, Tf-PNs accumulated more in the tumor area than PEG-PNs, and more in the NSCLC comorbid with T2DM group than the NSCLC group ( Fig. 1 C and 1D). This result shows that the same nanoparticles had different bio-distributions in different disease states, and Tf-PNs accumulated much more in the NSCLC comorbid with T2DM groups. \n\nIn conclusion, the state of the disease affects the distribution of nanoparticles. The interaction of receptor on cell and ligand on the nanoparticle surface involved the biological fate of nanoparticles. As is known that proteins in circulation will interact with nanoparticles once injected in vivo and form PC on the nanoparticle surface. Thus, we identified the composition of the PC on the nanoparticles and analyzed the difference caused by composition of plasma protein in different disease states.",

            "text": "As a final step, in vivo mouse studies were conducted in order to determine the impact of the NP shape and PEGylation on organ distribution and tumor uptake. Therefore, the various types of NOTA-conjugated NPs were first radiolabeled with 64 Cu. To guarantee high radiochemical purity of the final products before injection, ITLC of the 64 Cu-radiolabeled NPs was performed. The ITLC profiles confirmed the high efficacy of radiolabeling with an average radiochemical purity of 93%\u00b112% as calculated from the regions of interests (ROIs). For proper comparison, 10 \u00b5Ci (0.37 MBq) of the final radiolabeled NPs were injected in the tail vein in athymic nude mice bearing A431-tumor xenografts. Mice were sacrificed after 4 or 24 hours to determine the uptake of the radioactive NPs as %ID/g into selected organs and tumors. The complete dataset of this biodistribution study is given in Tables S2-S5, including all collected organs and the tumors. Based on the distinct nature of the NPs, significant differences in the uptake profiles of the particles were observed. In general, the highest uptake of radiolabeled NPs was seen for lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestine. In contrast, tumors and all other investigated organs showed lower overall uptake of radiolabeled NPs. To better emphasize these differences, only the biodistribution data of relevant organs and tumors are discussed separately and, in more detail, below. The biodistribution of non-PEGylated NPs in the major organs is shown in Figure 2A (4 hours) and Figure 2B (24 hours), and that of PEGylated NPs is shown in Figure 3A (4 hours) and Figure 3B (24 hours). Due to the scale difference, the uptake in the tumors after 24 hours is shown separately (Figure 4).",

            "text": "By changing the PEG lipid anchor length, it is possible to tune its shedding rate from the LNP surface, which is essential to promote cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Phospholipids and cholesterol are also employed as contributors to the LNP structural integrity and phase transition behavior. They assist on the mRNA encapsulation and ensure LNP stability over time (190). The versatility of the LNP platform allows for a multitude of modifications in the lipid components and/or proportions to achieve specific characteristics that make them preferentially accumulate in specific organs (195). Moreover, the LNP itself can possess immunogenic properties, which may be reduced to decrease inflammation and deleterious interactions (196)(197)(198). As addressed in this review, LNPs can also be functionalized with molecules that specifically interact with cellular receptors to increase their uptake by target cells. This is the concept behind the design of active targeting nanoparticles, which we believe represents the basis for the future of mRNA vaccines. \n\nAs seen above, antibodies are bullets of choice to target LNPs toward a specific receptor (Table 1). Antibodies are generally conjugated to LNPs after their formulation using PEGylated lipids with functional terminal groups, such as maleimide (199). This process is rather straightforward, but it is difficult to characterize the obtained functionalized particles and to quantify the conjugated antibodies (200). Moreover, chemically conjugating an antibody on the LNP surface does not offer full control of its orientation, and may result in antibodies unable to properly interact with their targets [although this field is making considerable progresses (201)]. \n\nRegarding LNP small molecule-functionalization, so far two main strategies have been described: through PEG or through cholesterol (Figure 3). Mannosylated PEG has been one of the first examples of sugar-based targeting to deliver GFP DNA to Kupfer cells in vitro and in vivo (86). PEG has been seen as the ideal candidate to ensure maximum ligand exposure as compared to cholesterol, since its hydrophilic tail is exposed toward the environment, as opposed to cholesterol, which is in the LNP inner structure.",

            "text": "PEG is a kind of hydrophilic, non-ionic polymer with good biological compatibility. At this stage, they are the most commonly used reagents to prevent the clearance of MPS and prolong the residence time of liposomes in the blood. The PEGylation of LNPs can effectively reduce the amount of LNP and serum proteins through the PEGylation of LNP. In addition, PEG-modified anionic liposomes can better diffuse into the lymphatic system after subcutaneous injection, reducing the retention at the injection site, and better aggregation and retention in the lymph nodes. Furthermore, shorter PEG modified chains allow for better particle retention and retention against lymph [26]. The modification of branched-chain PEG polymer and straight-chain PEG polymer can give the liposomes significantly different targeting and transfection ability [27]. However, recent studies have shown that the human body produces corresponding antibodies against PEG, which has always been associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness and further adverse reactions. For this reason, efforts are being made to find a better, equally biocompatible polymer to replace the PEG modification. However, some studies have found that adding a specific amount of dexamethasone into liposomes can effectively inhibit the adverse reactions caused by PEG modification [28]. \n\nDue to the inherent properties of lipid nanoparticles, most LNP-based vaccines target the liver if they rely on passive targeting by continuous circulation of the particles in the body and cellular uptake. \n\nChen and his colleagues have developed a positively charged PTX-LNP based on paclitaxel (PTX), modified with folic acid-modified bovine serum albumin (FB) to enable dual targeting of tumours [29]. Veiga and his colleagues achieved selective targeting of inflammatory leukocytes in the organism by combining anti-Ly6C antibodies with lipid nanoparticles loaded with siRNA.

The immunoliposomes with more than 5 mole% PEGylation exhibited a slight reduction in particle size and lower doxorubicin encapsulation by about 15% points (Supplementary Table S2). While the timedependent biodistribution patterns in most organs were like 5 mole% PEGylated liposomes, their concentrations in the blood and tumors were elevated by additional PEGylation (Supplementary Figure S5 and Supplementary Table S3). The tumor accumulation of the immunoliposomes increased with the enhanced circulation in blood. However, the additional PEGylation had little effect on the T/B and T/M ratios (Figure 5). These perplexing results may require a further systematic in vivo investigation to elucidate how much PEGylation affects blood circulation and the tumor accumulation of anti-EGFR immunoliposomes.  6 Cu-Dox-immunoliposomes in various tissues after intravenous injection in A549 tumor-bearing mice.

            "text": "PEGylation involves the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to molecules, such as drugs, proteins, or nanoparticles to improve systemic circulation time and reduce immunogenicity. PEG-lipids create a 'stealth' effect by shielding the surface of nanoparticles to limit the adsorption of serum proteins onto the nanoparticle's surface and minimize their recognition by the immune system (Hossian et al., 2019;Labatut and Mattheolabakis, 2018;Mattheolabakis et al., 2014;Suk et al., 2016). The steric hindrance introduced by the brush-like PEG molecules from the surface of the nanoparticles can result in prolonged residence time in the circulation of the nanoparticles, and potential accumulation to specific tissues, such as tumors, due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) (Lahooti et al., 2023). Similar to other lipids, PEG-lipids have a hydrophobic portion that is usually made of alkyl chains, which is integrated into the lipid layer, and a hydrophilic part that also contains the PEG, which extends from the surface of the LNPs. While PEGylation enhances circulation time and reduces immune recognition of nanoparticles, excessive PEGylation might hinder the efficient interaction of LNPs with target cells, leading to reduced therapeutic effects (Kumar et al., 2014), and fusion of the LNPs with the endosomal membrane due to steric hindrance, leading to therapeutic inefficacy (Aldosari et al., 2021;Kulkarni et al., 2019). More importantly, the PEG-lipids significantly impact LNP formulation and size (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Samaridou et al., 2020). In two studies by Belliveau et al. and Ryals et al., particle size decreases upon PEG lipid content increase in the formulations (Belliveau et al., 2012;Ryals et al., 2020).",

Cheng et al. studied the effect of SORT NPs for tissue-specific mRNA delivery, wherein different classes of LNPs were engineered systematically via the addition of a supplemental SORT molecule to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues. The four mDLNP formulations consisted of 5A2-SC8 (degradable dendritic cationic IL), cholesterol, DOPE, DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3 molar ratio), and mRNA. In this system, varying concentrations of permanent cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) were added. It was observed that the varying concentration of DOTAP was a key factor in determining tissue specificity, wherein 0% of DOTAP showed liver delivery, 10-15% showed spleen specific delivery, while 50% was optimal for lung-specific delivery. Similarly, the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) as a SORT molecule showed spleen selective delivery [81]. unmodified LNP) was ~3-folds higher in late endosomes/lysosomes, indicating improved siRNA delivery [76]. The modified LNPs resulted in the efficient delivery of siRNA-EpCAM when targeted against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) Epi-1, positive cells in vitro and also minimized the progression of tumour in mice [77]. PEGylation can also serve for the functionalization of LNP bioconjugation with biomolecules or ligands. For example, Chen et al. reported that GalNAc conjugated with LNP-siRNA-PEG formulation, a single dose of administration displayed a significant gene silencing effect on hepatocytes Factor VII (FVII).",

However, our data indicate a marked disparity in the efficacy of the nanoparticles used in these studies. LNP B provided much greater delivery of ARG1 mRNA to hepatocytes in vivo, resulting in higher arginase hepatic protein (as demonstrated by western blot and functional arginase activity) and greater improvement in control of ammonia, arginase, and guanidino compounds along with a more pronounced effect on quantitative myelination of the cingulum bundle and striatum. It is not clear why LNP A was markedly less efficient than LNP B in hepatocyte mRNA uptake and functional activity for both luciferase and arginase 1. While LNP A is efficient at expressing luciferase protein in muscle/peritoneum near the site of injection, previous investigations have demonstrated that arginase expression in myocytes is ineffective in extending survival and successfully treating arginase deficiency in mice. 43 The studies described in Figure 1 did demonstrate exposure of the luciferase mRNA-formulated LNP in extrahepatic tissues; however, outside of the liver for LNP B and the muscle at the site of the injection for LNP A, these were at a low level or modest at best. Very low levels were detected in the brain, with slightly more modest levels detected in the heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. These extra",

            "text": "LNPs principally contain an ionizable lipid that not only drives RNA encapsulation through their pH driven ability to form ion-pair interactions with the anionic phosphate backbone of RNA, but also aids in triggering endosomal escape through membrane destabilization (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Semple et al., 2010;Viger-Gravel et al., 2018;Lechanteur et al., 2018;Zelphati and Szoka, 1996;Sabnis et al., 2018). Other typical constituents of LNPs are a phospholipid and cholesterol to maintain structural integrity, and an outer polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid to coat the LNP (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Leung et al., 2012;Crawford et al., 2011). This outer decoration protects LNPs from the host immune response, imparts serum stability and is cleavable once inside the target cell (Fig. 1 A). Typically, the ionizable lipids used in LNP formulations are neutral at physiological pH, and hence they possess the characteristics of a neutral liposome. Neutral liposomes of < 100 nm hydrodynamic size have an overwhelming bias towards hepatocytes. Previously, Yan et al. have demonstrated the plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent enhanced plasma clearance of neutral liposomes by measuring a 3.6-fold faster rate of clearance vis-\u00e0-vis negatively charged liposomes in wild type mice versus ApoE deficient mice (Yan et al., 2005). This was further supported by Akinc et al. (Akinc et al., 2010) by showing the enhanced liver uptake of ionizable LNP (iLNP) compared to cationic LNP (cLNP) in the presence of ApoE. This necessitates alternative strategies for extrahepatic delivery of LNPs. In this regard, lung and lung airway is an organ of great therapeutic relevance that can be targeted by LNPs.",

Next, we evaluated whether inclusion of biodegradable lipids improved LNP safety and tolerability. In a single-dose escalation study in healthy mice, we dosed cKK-E12 LNPs and Syn-3 LNPs at various mRNA concentrations. Twenty-four hours after intravenous injection, there were no significant changes in key liver (e.g., AST, ALT) and kidney (e.g., BUN, total bilirubin) toxicity markers using Syn-3 LNPs at low administration dosage (\u22642.25 mg/kg) (Fig. 4a). This is in contrast to the toxicity profile of cKK-E12 LNPs containing mRNA, which showed a dosedependent increase in AST, ALT, BUN, and total bilirubin (Fig. 4a). At a 2.25 mg/kg dose or higher of mRNA in cKK-E12 particles, AST and BUN were already close to or exceeded their normal range. Although the structure of particles without mRNA can be substantially different, we evaluated the immunogenicity of LNPs formulated without mRNA. After a single injection of blank cKK-E12 LNPs, we observed elevation of interleukins and chemokines (Fig. 4b). Notably, proinflammatory associated cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IFN, IL6, TNF\u03b1, groAlpha, and MCP1, were upregulated. This trend was not observed in A6 LNPs, and the level of inflammatory cytokines was reduced in the Syn-3 LNP system compared with cKK-E12 alone.",

            "text": "[41] Given that LNPs are recognized to escape from endosomes before and after reaching the late stages of endosomal maturation, this pathway proves advantageous for active targeting. [42][43][44] Alternatively, it's possible that strong binding of the LNPs to the TfR results in their release back to the membrane. Furthermore, to decrease unspecific uptake and facilitate the active targeting by decreasing the protein corona formation, we employed PEGylated lipids for conjugation. [18] We performed cellular uptake studies using Jurkat cells. The T-lymphocyte cell line is often used in studies focused on nanocarrier targeting via the TfR pathway and known to express TfR in a large number. [8,34,45] These cells were transfected with LNPs formulated with a blend of fluorescently labeled siRNA and scrambled siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the absence of an active targeting ligand, the cellular uptake of LNPs varies depending on the concentration of PEGylated lipids in the formulations. The highest cellular uptake was measured after transfection with 1.5 % azide-LNPs. However, an increment in the percentage of PEGylated lipids resulted in decreased cellular uptake, a phenomenon attributed to so-called \"PEG dilemma\": the stealth effect hinders cellular uptake and endosomal escape, albeit enhancing colloidal stability and increasing blood circulation. [46,47] The formulation with 0.5 % PEGylated lipid exhibited reduced uptake, which might be attributed to colloidal instability of the formulation. Conversely, the inclusion of a targeting ligand amplified cellular uptake significantly. This trend was again dependent on the PEGylated lipid concentration utilized. Highest uptake was achieved when transfecting cells with a lipid composition of 2.5 % PEGylated lipid. Given that the number of transferrin molecules present on the surface of LNPs remained higher for 1.5 % compared to 2.5 % formulations, we postulate that the increased cellular uptake of LNPs is attributed to the number of LNPs and siRNA internalized.",

            "text": "PEG, a non-ionic biocompatible synthetic polymer, is soluble both in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents [68]. Incorporation of PEG provides the LNPs with an external polymeric layer onto their outer shell, and this helps to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and the components of a phagocytic system, thereby extending their in vivo circulation time. It prevents aggregation during storage and increases the stability of the NPs. The length and density of the polymer chains determine the circulatory half-life of LNPs. The PEG chain length and its molecular weight (750 to 5000 kDa) has shown varying effect in vivo clearance study, which resulted from its interaction with different-sized opsonins which is present in the bloodstream [69]. \n\nThe surface coating of LNP with PEG also influences the overall surface charge on LNPs. For instance, Kumar et al. studied the effect of polyethylene glycol-1,2-dimyristoylsn-glycerol-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG-DMG) for shielding the LNP surface charge using 1.5% (LNP1.5), 5% (LNP5), and 10% (LNP10) PEG-DMG concentration (Figure 3). The LNPs were formulated using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, DLin-MC3-DMA. The increasing PEG-DMG concentration resulted in a decrease in zeta potential (performed at pH 5.5) which was observed to drop from +32 mV (for LNP1.5) to +24 (for LNP5) and +18 mV (for LNP10) suggesting that higher PEG-DMG reduces the surface charge density of LNP. Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property.",

            "text": "Given that ~67 % of the LNPs from the control group were still in circulation after 4 h (Fig. 2b), we reasoned that further studies at later time points would be more adequate. Furthermore, we argued that perhaps the effect of RES blockade on long-circulating particles would be less pronounced than for short-circulating particles. For this purpose, we decided to study the biodistribution of PEG-DMG-LNPs (short circulating) at 6 h and PEG-DSG-LNPs (long circulating) at 24 h in follow-up experiments. On top of that, we decided to employ a dual labeling approach by which a lipid in the LNP formulation is labeled with Cy7 and a part of the loaded siAR is labeled with Cy5.5. Moreover, we switched the engrafted prostate cancer model to LNCaP, as s.c. injection of PC346C resulted in only 41 % tumor engraftment. Their slow growth was not ideal for in vivo studies, where large cell numbers are required. Finally, we decided to abandon the dextran sulfate studies as dextran sulfate-treated mice showed clear signs of toxicity (shivering and reduced movement in treated mice) and dextran sulfate caused prolonged bleeding of the animals after submandibular puncture due to its anti-coagulant effect (Forwell and Ingram, 2011). \n\nAfter preparation and characterization of the LNPs (Table S1), we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of PEG-DMG and PEG-DSG siAR-LNPs, with and without pre-treatment of liposomes. For animals treated with PEG-DMG LNPs (short-circulating particles) we fixed an endpoint at 6 h and for animals treated with PEG-DSG-LNPs (long-circulating particles) at 24 h post injection (Fig. 3a). \n\nWe first determined the circulation time of the LNPs by measuring the Cy5.5 and Cy7 fluorescent signal in plasma at multiple time points.",

The in vivo PEG-AuNP biodistribution assessed in rats was compared with predicted distribution using a non-mechanistic model applied to in vitro cells. The internalization and exclusion of PEG-AuNPs were modeled as first-order rate processes with the partition coefficient describing the overall tendency of NP accumulation.

At 24 h all the mice were sacrificed from each group, tissues excised and the percentage injected dose per gram (%ID g'l)was calculated.

The statistical significance was evaluated using the two- tailed Student's t-test. extravasation, rate of drainage into the lymphatic system and any uptake via specific receptors.

At the early (1 h) time point, there is no evidence of exclusion of pegylated materials from normal tissues, arguing that the complexes are not in a sized range for which postulated differences in fenestration between capillaries in tumour or normal tissues would play a predominant part in the distribution (Sung et al., 1990). \n\nOur study shows specific tumour localisation of PEG- F(ab')2-A5B7-CPG2.",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

            "text": "10][11][12] Cheng et al. introduced the concept of selective organ targeting (SORT) where the addition of a SORT lipid to the LNP composition facilitates LNP targeting to relevant cell types in the lungs, spleen, or liver in vivo, depending on the SORT lipid and LNP charge. [11] As an example of active, ligand-based targeting, covalent antibody conjugation to the LNP surface was shown to facilitate T cell targeting and CAR T treatment of cardiac fibrosis in vivo. [12] However, full control and tunability of the targeting approaches are yet to be demonstrated. \n\nSince the chemical composition and physical arrangement of molecules in LNPs play such a big role in their performance (e.g., stability, targeting, cell uptake, endosomal escape, cytotoxicity etc.), the majority of LNP optimization has focused on compositional screening to maximize in vitro / in vivo functional response. ][15] Similar observations have been made for polymer and lipidoid systems, where structural changes in the individual components impacted performance and cytotoxicity. [16,17] However, less is known about the effect of LNP structural features (e.g., lipid packing, phase structure, and distribution) on the LNP performance in vitro and in vivo. One of the challenges with studying structure and function relationships in LNPs has been that to change LNP structure it is often necessary to change the lipid composition. This makes it almost impossible to decouple the impact of structure and lipid composition on LNP efficacy. In this publication, we address this challenge from a membrane biophysical perspective. When it comes to endosomal escape, which is possibly the biggest bottleneck in the delivery of oligonucleotides, it has been suggested that a highly curved inverted hexagonal lipid phase (H II ), drives the LNP cargo release through membrane fusion/reorganization. [22] Recently it was shown that highly structured lipid liquid crystalline nanoparticles (H II , cubosome, Fd3m) were taken up better into CHO cells compared to simpler lamellar liposomes, implying a key role of the structural features of the nanoparticles.

            "text": "We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. 15 olipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in the incorporation of LNPs into hepatocytes in vivo. 16 Plasma ApoE preferentially binds to PEG lipids of the LNP surface. LDLR proteins on hepatocytes recognize ApoE-LNP complexes, resulting in LNP incorporation via endocytosis. LNPs become cationic due to reduced pH during endosome maturation, leading to LNP fusion to the endosomal membrane. 17 siRNA is finally released into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing RNAi-mediated knockdown of target molecules in hepatocytes. \n\n3][24][25][26] Therefore, gene suppression in mononuclear phagocytes by LNPs may be an effective treatment strategy for such disorders. \n\nIn this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of our asymmetric ionizable lipid-based biodegradable LNPs on immune cells. LNPs were strongly incorporated into tissue-resident macrophages, including liver macrophages. Analysis of ApoE-deficient mice revealed that LNP uptake by liver macrophages is not dependent on ApoE expression. Administering LNPs encapsulating siRNA targeting interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) (siIrf5-LNPs), an essential transcription factor in triggering inflammatory responses, reduced IRF5 expression in macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, prophylactic administration of siIrf5-LNPs was effective in preventing liver damage in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. These results indicate that our biodegradable LNPs are a useful tool for analyzing macrophage function in vivo, and they can be used in novel therapies for treating inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Local placental delivery is important because PlGF levels in the placenta promote endothelial growth, vasculogenesis, and overall placental development [63]. Recent evidence suggests the role of PlGF on endothelial-dependent relaxation mechanisms [64], which may be advantageous locally in the placenta to improve uterine and placental vessel remodeling, while increasing blood flow to the fetus. Moving forward, we aim to incorporate targeting ligands into this platform to further increase local placental delivery. Based on the data presented here, we have developed an LNP platform (A10) that delivers multiple types of mRNA to the placenta. \n\nToxicity Analysis. Lastly, we assessed toxicity of the LNPs with encapsulated PlGF mRNA to both the dams and fetuses. Serum from dams treated with LNPs A3, A10, and A14 was examined for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) content to assess liver toxicity, which yielded no significant difference between AST levels in dam serum from all treatment groups (Fig. 6A). The only significant difference in serum ALT levels was from dams treated with LNP A3 compared to both saline (p = 0.017) and LNP A10 (p = 0.008, Fig. 6A, Table S11-11.2). These results indicate that LNP A10, our topperforming LNP for PlGF delivery in vivo, does not yield liver damage as assessed by enzyme release in dams. We also assessed AST and ALT content in fetal liver tissues following treatment, which revealed no significant differences between fetuses from dams treated with each treatment group. Interestingly, two fetuses taken from dams treated with LNP A14 had slightly elevated AST (0.007 compared to 0.134 U/ mg of total protein) that was not statistically significant (Fig. 6B, Table S11. 3-11.4). \n\nWe measured concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in dam serum and placenta tissues 24 h after treatment to investigate the acute inflammatory response to LNPs [65].",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have provided insights into the targeting capabilities of LNPs after modification, specifically measuring the average number of transferrin molecules bound to individual LNPs and the relationship between PEG concentration and the number of bound transferrin molecules. We utilized strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition for transferrin conjugation and successfully achieved particle characteristics suitable for pulmonary delivery. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate cellular uptake in T cells dependent on the targeting ligand concentration and achieved > 50 % knockdown of the therapeutically relevant GATA3 gene in vitro and ex vivo. \n\nThe saturation effect we noted suggests potential limitations in modifying LNP surfaces, particularly when using PEGylated lipids as spacers for active targeting. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies, investigating Tf-LNP efficiency in T cell targeting and for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in in vivo models. Characterizing LNPs regarding hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. LNPs were prepared with 100 pmol GATA3 siRNA at an N/P ratio of 3. The hydrodynamic diameter and PDI (panel A) were assessed using DLS at a pH of 7.4. The zeta potential (panel B) was determined using PALSat a pH of 7.4. The encapsulation efficiency (panel C) was evaluated by diluting the LNPs in TE-buffer followed by a 10-minute incubation with a 1:100 dilution of RiboGreen assay reagent, with readings taken using a plate reader. The standard curve was performed in TE buffer. (Data indicates mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3). Cellular uptake in Jurkat cells after siRNA LNP treatment. Jurkat cells were incubated with LNPs loaded with 100 pmol of AF647-labeled siRNA at a N/P ratio of 3, as described above. 24 h after-transfection, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (panels A and B) and the proportion of transfected cells (panels C and D) were assessed using flow cytometry for both azide-LNPs and Tf-LNPs.",

However, we decided to compare their intrahepatic distribution by observing liver tissues that had been injected with DiI-labeled LNP encapsulating a mixture of siRNA (siGL4:siCy5-GFP 1:1 ratio) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of both siRNAs using CLSM. Although the injected siRNA dose was higher than that used for obtaining gene silencing (0.5 vs 0.1 mg/kg, respectively), it was selected to enable us to visualize hepatic distribution with high sensitivity and clarity. \n\nWe observed the LNP containing the YSK05 lipid only (YSK05-LNP) and a pKa of 6.50 was extensively taken up by hepatocytes (Figure 6, upper). In the image, the YSK05-LNP (represented in red color) is extensively distributed in hepatocytes, which are the most abundant cells in the liver and are defined in the image as the nonfluorescent areas that are infiltrated with LSECs which are shown in green color. On the other hand, the YSK05/12-LNP with a pKa value of 7.15 was highly taken up by LSECs (Figure 6, lower). In the image, YSK05/12-LNP (represented in red) is distributed on LSECs (the green color of LSECs turned into red or orange because of LNP accumulation in this area). These results suggest that, despite the similar hepatic biodistribution of YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP, as shown in Figure S2, their intrahepatic distribution varied depending on their pKa value.",

            "text": "If the influence of NP PEGylation on biodistribution is known for years [69][70][71][72], the thorough characterization and consequences of a biomolecular corona formed in vivo has not been investigated yet. However, of interest are several studies dealing with a pre-coating of the NP with proteins, namely with serum albumin and apolipoprotein E [53,73,74]. Whatever the nature of the NP core, polymeric or metallic, it seems that such a pre-coating increases the blood circulation time and reduces the clearance speed. For example, a 6-fold increase of half-time was reported by Peng for BSA-precoated NP compared to \"bare\" NP [53]. Based upon in vitro experiments, the authors proposed as an explanation a weakened opsonization and a reduced phagocytosis. In all these studies, liver stays the main organ of NP accumulation (more than 90% of the injected dose after 19 h [74]). Still, the protein used for pre-coating seems to nuance the amounts of NP in other organs, albumin targeting lungs preferentially, and brain to a lesser extent, compared to apo-E [74]. One could take advantage of this improved retention when pre-coating NP with albumin in cancer therapy as specific factors account for the accumulation of this protein in solid tumors: a decreased level of HSA in cancer patients, inducing a need for albumin digestion to cover the need in amino acids for tumor growth and the presence of two albumin receptors, gp60 in tumor endothelium and SPARC in tumor interstitium [75].",

This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges. This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

            "text": "The effect of PEGylation was tested in vivo in mice with PC-3 tumour xenografts performed with BN conjugates at an injected peptide amount of 0.075 nmol (Table 2). The highest tumour uptake of 177 Lu-DOTA-Lys-BN (1.88% ID/g) and 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN (3.43% ID/g) was found 1 h p.i., the latter being significantly higher. Thus, the enhanced enzymatic stability induced by PEGylation compensated for the lower receptor affinity of DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN. Furthermore, the tumour washout was slightly slower for the PEGylated analogue. Thus, 1.04% ID/g was found for the 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN 24 h p.i., whereas only 0.54% ID/g of 177 Lu-DOTA-Lys-BN remained in the tumour. At 1 h p. i., both analogues showed their highest uptake in the pancreas, which expresses GRP receptors (8.68% ID/g and 9.62% ID/g for 177 Lu-DOTA-Lys-BN and 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN, respectively). The liver uptake of both 177 Lu-DOTA-Lys-BN and 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN was low (0.26% ID/g and 0.57% ID/g at 1 h p.i., respectively). Kidney accumulation was higher for the 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5k -Lys-BN in comparison with that of the non-PEGylated analogue at 1 h p.i. (4.89% ID/g vs.  2.86% ID/g, respectively). The renal clearance, however, was fast for both analogues (1.84% ID/g vs. 1.41% ID/g at 24 h p.i., respectively).",

We found that high Au signal intensity accumulated in the region surrounding the portal area, and then increased markedly over time after injection. In addition, more Au accumulated near the portal region than near the central vein. \n\nLA-ICP-MS imaging in the spleen showed that PEG-GNPs quickly entered the splenic parenchyma at 1 h after injection and increased over time. PEG-GNPs perfused from the red pulp near the white pulp region and gradually deposited in the red pulp, which is located near the marginal region of the spleen. At 24 h post-injection, a significant amount of PEG-GNPs had entered the marginal zone and the red pulp and had primarily deposited in the marginal region of the spleen. The Au images of the PEG-GNP injected mouse lung showed that the PEG-GNPs accumulated in the regions near blood vessels. \n\nLA-ICP-MS imaging of PEG-GNPs showed very clear transfer and clearance pathways in kidney. The Au image at 1 h post-injection revealed that PEG-GNPs were quickly transported via the blood steam from the renal artery to the renal pyramids and primarily accumulated in the renal pelvis. At 4 h after i.v. injection, the intensity of the Au signal in the renal pelvis decreased, but high Au levels were broadly seen in the renal pyramids region. At 24 h post-injection, high Au signal was concentrated in the renal medulla and the renal cortex.",

The time course of PEG-AuNPs burden in individual tissues is depicted in Figure 2. It is evident that compared to AuNPs of similar diameter coated with triphenylphosphine mono-sulfonate [21,27] or dextran [28], the surface modification with PEG prolonged the circulation time with a blood half-life of 57 h (non-PBPK two-compartment model). Nonetheless, in line with the above-referenced studies, the liver and spleen were the primary sites of NPs accumulation. The dose recovery after 1 h in the blood and four tissues analyzed in our study was 89%; however, this decreased significantly to 30% and 16% after 4 h and 672 h, respectively.

Conversely, a fast excretion through urine occurred for 68 Ga-HEP24-ESIONP and more than 60% of the ID per cm 3 was found in the bladder after 60 min, while less than 8% was found in the heart (Fig. S10 \u2020). Yet, the most promising results were found for 68 Ga-HEP8-ESIONP, functionalized with the intermediate coating length. The hepatic elimination was limited to \u223c15% of the ID per cm 3 and more signal was found in the kidneys that translocated quickly into the bladder (Fig. 4B). This fast transfer into the urine may ensure a low nephrotoxicity. Even more interesting, around 12% of the ID per cm 3 was still present in the bloodstream after 60 minutes and more than 5% persisted even after 3 hours (estimated from the signal in the heart, Fig. 4B and Fig. S10 \u2020). We therefore had a closer look to the tumoral accumulation for this probe and found a small retention around 3-4% that is maintained overtime (Fig. 4B and C). Although limited, this accumulation was in the range of the renal clearable inorganic NP 44 and unexpected towards the low vascularized BT-474 xenograft model used. 47 Further studies will be required to know whether the accumulation observed for 68 Ga-HEP8-ESIONP was due to the EPR effect or also in part to an \"active inherent targeting\" of the heparin coating, which is known to be able to interact with various components of the tumour microenvironment (VEGFs, HPSE, etc.). The observed clearance can be first interpreted according to the hydrodynamic sizes of the nanoparticles.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the influence of LNP formulations with varying PEG lipids and ionizable lipids on the repeated administration of mRNA-loaded LNPs (mRNA/LNP).Our investigations demonstrated that ionizable lipids exhibited negligible effects on the outcomes of repeated dosages.In contrast, the lipid structure and molar ratio of PEG lipids exerted a substantial influence on the protein expression of mRNA/LNP.It became apparent that PEG molecules linked to LNPs, as opposed to free PEG, played a pivotal role in the generation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies.Within the biological milieu, PEGincorporated LNPs assumed the character of large PEG entities, potentially provoking antibody production.Upon subsequent injections, this phenomenon culminated in a diminution of protein expression by mRNA/LNP.Specifically, successive administrations of firefly luciferase (fLuc) mRNA caused a large decline in luminescent expression within the liver.The assessment of gene editing effects following repeated administrations yielded variations contingent upon the specific PEG lipid used.\n\nNotably, our investigation revealed that an increase in the lipid tail length of the PEG lipid corresponded to a reduction in PEG shedding rates and an escalation in anti-PEG IgM production, ultimately triggering the ABC phenomenon.This observation confirmed previous studies of PEG-NPs [33].Upon exposure to blood, PEG lipid shedding commenced within the LNP, with the process culminating in the spleen.Within the splenic marginal zone, B cells are responsible for the synthesis of antibodies.Consequently, it is suggested that LNPs exhibiting diminished PEG shedding would augment the synthesis of anti-PEG IgM.From this perspective, C14 DMG-PEG 2000, characterized by a shorter lipid tail length, exhibited a higher likelihood of shedding within LNPs compared to C16 PEG 2000 ceramide.\n\nThis study also provided a comparative investigation of the protein expression efficiency exhibited by C16 PEG ceramideincorporated LNPs as opposed to DMG-PEG LNPs during their initial administration.The results revealed that the first administration of C16 PEG ceramide-conjugated LNPs yielded relatively higher protein expression efficiency in comparison to DMG-PEG LNPs.",

            "text": "erythrocyte aggregation and morphology changes, and a prolonged coagulation effect, and that these side effects are alleviated by PEGylation. Besides, both pristine PLNPs and PEGylated PLNPs are well tolerated to the risk of complement-activated thrombosis and inflammation. Mart\u00ednez-Alfaro et al. studied the in vivo toxicity of hydroxylated and PEGylated PLNPs at different concentrations within 6 months [80]. Results showed that no toxic effects were detected at doses of hydroxylated PLNPs ~ 2 mg/ mouse classically used for biological imaging. Similarly, no toxic effects could be evidenced on any of the groups treated with PEGylated PLNPs across the range of tested concentrations. The distribution and metabolism of PLNPs in vivo have an important influence on their toxicity. Richard et al. reported the influence of particle size, surface state, and physicochemical properties on PLNPs biological fate in vivo [63,81]. The results demonstrate that masking charges, increasing the aminosilane density, and reducing the particle size can reduce the capture of PLNPs by the liver and effectively increase the circulation time of PLNPs in vivo. Unlike other fluorescent nanoprobes, the PersL of PLNPs can persist for a long time after excitation, and there is a risk of double exposure of nanoparticles and PersL for in vivo applications. Zhang et al. systematically studied the potential risk of nanoparticles and PersL of PLNPs within 2 months (Fig. 3) [78]. After intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg PEGylated PLNPs, most of them accumulated in the reticuloendothelial system and could be gradually cleared out of the body through the digestive system. Besides, neither the PEGylated PLNPs nor the PersL showed significant toxicity in mice over 2 months. Although more careful toxicology studies are necessary for example the effect of PLNPs on the gene, protein or to evaluate their biotransformation, the lack of obvious toxicity shown in the above studies encourages future development of PLNPs for in vivo biomedical research.",

            "text": "Regarding all the above-mentioned cases about the restriction of the clinical usage of NPs in cancer therapy, numerous studies and researches have been done to develop new methods for the treatment of cancer with potential translation to the clinic. However, the delivery of NPs into the tumor site, their biological distribution, lack of clearance from the systemic circulation, inherent toxicity, and off-target effects are still significant restrictions that bridge the gap between laboratory and clinical usage of NPs [114,115]. Indeed, a further concern is related to the long-term fate of the delivered GNPs and the associated long-term cytotoxicity. Although solid knowledge of the systemic effects arising from the clustering and accumulation of GNPs is missing, the first investigations seem to indicate GNPs' superficial charge and dimensions as crucial aspects [6,116]. Moreover, the preferential accumulation sites appear to be the liver and spleen, as shown by Goodrich and colleagues, which observed foreign bodies in 100% of livers and 7 out of 8 spleens in murine models. Conversely, no foreign bodies were found in the brain, heart, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, or mesenteric lymph nodes, after administration of PEGylated GNRs (length = 44.7 \u00b1 5.4 nm and width = 14.3 \u00b1 1.8 nm) [117]. Due to the limited period of observation related to animal studies, typically up to 6 months from the administration [6], the available data are not sufficient to estimate the actual GNPs' long-term cytotoxicity, hence further investigations are needed to assess their behavior in broader time intervals.",

            "text": "Based on the above results, the i.t. route appeared to have better therapeutic activity for P12 and an ideal biodistribution profile with P12 accumulated more in the lung than in the RES organs. However, we were wondering whether the favorable biodistribution profile of P12 by i.t. administration is P12 specific or due to the local administration only. To answer this question, we formulated two types of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified GNPs to replace the peptides of P12, and investigated their distribution in the lung, liver, spleen and blood at an earlier time point (4 h) and a later time point (24 h) after i.t. administration in the healthy mice. The two types of PEG ligands used were HS-PEG2000-M and HS-PEG2000-OH with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group at the end, respectively (Fig. 6a). These PEG-GNPs were formulated the same way as the P12 (Fig. 1a). At 4 h after i.t. administration, the amount of P12 in the lung was significantly higher than that of the Au-PEG2000-M and Au-PEG2000-OH (Fig. 6b). However, this difference disappeared at 24 h post treatment (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). There was no difference in the accumulation between P12 and the two PEG-modified GNPs groups in the liver and spleen at both 4 and 24 h post treatment (Fig. 6b and Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Interestingly, the P12 level in the blood was significantly lower than PEGmodified GNPs, suggesting that P12 was less capable of entering blood stream from the lung in comparison with PEG-modified GNPs. The two different end groups of PEG-GNPs (Au-PEG2000-M vs. Au-PEG2000-OH) had no effects on their biodistribution profiles. These results suggested that it was the unique characteristics of P12 that contributed to the preferred biodistribution of P12 in the lung in addition to the i.t. administration.",

            "text": "specific monocyte/M\u03d5 receptors can provide effective uptake and thereby reduce uptake by other M\u03d5 subsets. 35 We observed an increased accumulation of both PEG-LNP(Cal)-IgG and PEG-LNP(Cal)-\u03b1CD163 in the upper abdomen as compared to PEG-LNP(Cal). Due to the route of injection, mAB-modified calcitriol LNPs are most likely captured by hepatic M\u03d5 (Kupffer cells) in the liver and by splenic red-pulp M\u03d5, as these cells are in direct contact with the bloodstream. Nevertheless, the uptake of IgG-targeted calcitriol LNPs, most likely by the Fc receptor, should also not be underestimated because these particles are also taken up by the majority of M\u03d5 in the liver and spleen. Interestingly, particle characteristics and the route of administration play a significant role in particle uptake and tissue-specific accumulation. IgG-modified LNP delivery systems administered subcutaneously have been shown to be useful for the targeting of, for example, regional lymph nodes, 60 and orally administered Fc receptor-targeted nanoparticles have been shown to enter systemic circulation through transepithelial transport. 61 In conclusion, our study shows for the first time the targeting of calcitriol specifically to M\u03d5. In summary, we demonstrate the uptake and effect of PEGylated and AB-modified calcitriol LNPs on human M\u03d5 in vitro and bioavailability in vivo. We were able to deliver the bioactive metabolite to M\u03d5. The targeting of CD163 for the specific delivery of calcitriol may be a useful approach for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases while potentially avoiding adverse side effects.\n\nbe published and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.",

In addition, the use of D-amino acids in the functionalization of the nanoparticles contributes to a higher accumulation in the biofilm region 14 . \n\nThe ex vivo acquisition of isolated catheters corroborated the previous results, with a higher accumulation of F-Cy7-LNPs in the catheter pieces than the corresponding non-functionalized formulations (Fig. 6d). Although F-Cy7-MLNs show a higher fluorescent signal than Cy7-MLNs, it is not statistically significant. The accumulation of nanoparticles in the spleen, kidneys, and liver was also evaluated ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. 4). At 24 h postadministration, all formulations were mainly accumulated in the kidneys and liver, while a considerably lower signal was observed in the spleen. These findings revealed that after 24 h, a high number of nanoparticles was cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which led to accumulation in the liver 30 . The high intensity of the fluorescence signal in the kidneys also shows that these nanocarriers can be eliminated by the renal clearance pathway, which substantially reduces the potential toxicity of the nanoparticles, compared with the RES clearance. Thus, the high renal clearance observed for the developed LNPs and MLNs may suggest that these nanosystems present a good biocompatibility profile 31 .",

            "text": "Once the RPE is compromised, they are unable to support the PRs, which leads to cell death. In contrast, in the NHP, we did not see any PR cell loss, but in areas of disrupted RPE, there was T cell infiltration in the choroid and microglia activation in the retina. The NHP was dosed at a 100\u00d7 higher concentration than the rodents, which could account for the observable immune response. In addition, NHPs are known to have increased immunoreactivity compared to rodents (38). Overall, we suspect that the toxicity and immunogenicity are associated with LNP dose and these effects can be mitigated by reducing LNP dose. We will need to fully characterize the immune response associated with LNP-mRNA delivery to the retina, which would include performing a dose escalation study and assessing the kinetics of local and systemic responses, with and without immunosuppression. In addition to dose, novel biodegradable systems or new materials designed for retinal delivery can mitigate toxic effects. The current LNP formulation contains the MC3 ionizable lipid, which was developed for liver targeting and has been associated with increased toxicity as compared to biodegradable counterparts (21). Lowering the dose in combination with retina-targeting lipids could pave the way toward safe and effective LNP-mRNA therapeutics. \n\nOne main limitation of the study is that we eluted peptides from the entire neural retina after intravitreal delivery of the bacteriophage library. It is possible that if PRs were isolated and phage was eluted from an isolated PR population, then ligands may have improved PR-specific uptake. In addition, continued modifications of our elucidated peptide ligands, whether by means of circularization, chemical, or residue substitution strategies, have the potential to further enhance penetrative and targeting abilities. Further work is also needed to reveal the receptors within the retina that enable in vivo uptake, internalization, and endosomal escape of MH42 LNPs (39). In conclusion, this study shows that peptide-conjugated LNPs can be powerful tools to advance mRNA-based therapeutics in the retina.",

            "text": "Controlling the distribution of LNPs is critical for the treatment of diseases occurring in specific organs. Apart from optimizing the intrinsic properties of LNPs, targeted delivery to extrahepatic areas can be regulated through various strategies, including the choice of administration routes, active targeting and passive targeting associated with the surface protein corona of LNPs. 122 ocal administrations, such as intradermal, intramuscular, intratracheal injections etc., prolong protein expression at the injection site. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of RNA-LNPs, the most common vaccination routes, effectively migrate to LNs through lymphatic vessels and induce stronger immune responses. 134 Pulmonary deliveries, mainly including intratracheal, intranasal, and inhalation routes, allow LNPs to bypass pre-exposure to the systemic circulation before reaching the lung, thus avoiding liver metabolism and enhancing LNPs selective delivery to the lungs and LNs. Additionally, intraperitoneal administration, intravitreal, or subretinal injection provide personalized treatment options for pancreatic diseases such as cancer and diabetes, as well as genetic retinal degeneration. 135 Overall, local drug delivery generally offers highly selective delivery of therapeutic agents to the disease site while minimizing systemic side effects. Notably, local administration is only suitable for diseases with known and accessible pathological sites, such as tumors or traumatic injuries. 127 ommonly, active targeting of LNPs is achieved through specific recognition and binding between ligands modified on the surface of LNPs and receptors on the surface of the target cell. Similar to the challenges mentioned earlier in this review, while active targeting tactics enhance delivery efficiency and residence time of nucleic acids, progress in targeted delivery has been limited due to the personalized nature of this process, which is influenced by the heterogeneity of diseases. 133 he passive targeting of LNPs can be mediated by the protein corona formed by non-specific adsorption on their outer surface. 136 The adsorption of proteins is influenced by various physical properties of LNPs, including charge, composition, and size, among others. Changes in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25",

            "text": "The paracellular mechanism of colloidal gold uptake they observed suggests that particles can enter the body without being subjected to organized intracellular processes such as lysosomal enzymatic degradation that may be deleterious to conjugated proteins or molecular species. \n\nOral and intravenous (i.v.) injections rely on the presence of leaky vasculature and enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR; ie, passive targeting), which forces NPs to preferentially accumulate at the tumor site [75][76][77][78]. Several studies have shown less than 10% ID/g (Injected Dose/gram) of NPs delivered to the tumor when administrated by intravenous injection [79,80]. In the i.v. injection of NPs, the main pathway of clearance is through the reticuloendothelial system (RES) via macrophages in the liver and spleen [80]. Thus, the decrease in the interaction between NPs and the RES lengthens the blood circulation time, and this longer period is often associated with higher intratumoral penetration [81]. \n\nJong et al. compared the tissue distribution of various sized GNPs in the rat after i.v. injection through the tail vein and investigated the size-dependent organ distribution of GNPs [82]. Using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and TEM, they measured the presence of gold in different parts of the body 24 hours after the injection. The highest percentage of gold was found in the blood and liver, corresponding to 70% to 80% of the initial injection dose. The results showed that the majority of the NPs accumulate in the liver after i.v. injection irrespective of the NP's size. \n\nThe intratumoral (i.t.), that is, direct, administration of NPs with a reasonable dose by which the particles are directly introduced into the tumor site has shown successful results [83,84]. Kanavi et al. performed an ex vivo study on a fresh human whole eye enucleated for choroidal melanoma to investigate the distribution of GNPs within the eye after i.t. injection into the tumor.",

Thus, it was also speculated that the pKa of LNP4, closer to the endosomal pH, optimized the \"proton-sponge\" effect, endosomal disruption, and consequent release of pDNA to transcription and translation machinery. However, further studies are necessary to determine this mechanism and the traffic through the cytoplasm to the nucleus for gene expression.\n\nThe fact that GFP expression reached a plateau in doses higher than 0.2 \u00b5g could be related to the increased amount of PEG-lipid, which can reduce LNP interactions with target cells and limit transfection. 49 For the experiment performed in vivo, a single intravenous injection was used to investigate the transfection efficiency and toxicity in vivo of the top-performing formulation. LNP4 was able to induce significant gene expression in the heart tissue. Further optimization starting from lead LNP4 formulation, including the use of barcoded DNA to screen LNPs in vivo and/or surface functionalization to enhance selectivity target to heart tissue will likely enhance the efficiency and avoid binding to plasma proteins as well as off-target effects. It is described that LNP administration directly in the lungs or via the intradermal route can trigger an inflammatory response increasing the frequency of neutrophils, which is considered a potent adjuvant. 50 Recently, other studies have reported myocarditis in a small percentage of vaccinated people with mRNA vaccines, which uses LNPs as vectors. 51 Therefore, the ability of our LNPs to trigger inflammation or other toxicity in the heart, such as cardiac function was also investigated. The levels of circulating myeloid cells and inflammatory cytokines were not significantly changed in the heart after LNP treatment. In addition, it was demonstrated that cell contractility and protein expression of SERCA2, AKT phosphorylation at Ser473, and pERK1/2, which reflect the cardiac cell function and survival, was not affected after LNP treatment. Collectively, our results have demonstrated that our LNPs work well in heart tissue and do not induce heart or liver damage, hematological disorder, or inflammatory response, which reproduce",

            "text": "Jayaraman et al. showed that the ionizable lipid should have a pK a of ~6.5 for the highest activity of hepatic siRNA delivery [16]. Recently, for the first time, we were able to elucidate the pH-induced changes in the bilayer structure in LPXs comprising ionizable lipids in situ by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [17], where we could reveal clear differences as a function of lipid structure and the composition of the systems. \n\nAs helper lipids, typically phospholipids comprising either a phosphatidyl ethanolamine (-PE) or phosphatidyl choline (-PC) head group are used, where lipids with saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains may be selected. The helper lipids may have an important influence on the activity and the targeting selectivity of the LNPs. For example, it has been shown that by using dioleyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in LPXs as a helper lipid, the mRNA expression in the liver could be reduced to very low levels [18,19]. For many future applications of mRNA, therapeutics such as extrahepatic targeting, or more generally speaking, organ-selective targeting, is still an unmet need, since classical LNPs typically result in the highest expression in the liver. The selection of appropriate helper lipids and lipid compositions may allow the better adjustment of targeting selectivity according to the therapeutic requirements [20]. \n\nThe use of PEG-functionalized lipids (PEGylated lipids) as an excipient for drug and mRNA delivery has been widely adopted in various nanoparticulate systems, including liposomes, proteins and LNPs. In addition to modulating circulation in the bloodstream, PEGylation is necessary for LNP engineering to avoid aggregation during the mixing of the RNA with the lipid solution.",

As a result, 10PS was finally chosen as the most adequate LNPs for MSC-guided drug delivery since it could be efficiently taken up by cancer cells, highly accumulated inside tumors, and uniformly diffuse throughout whole tumor tissues. \n\nFluorescent signals from normal organs were additionally analyzed ex vivo to confirm any undesirable delivery of LNPs in normal tissues (Fig. 4c). The fluorescent signals of all LNPs were barely detectable from all organs regardless of the MSC-guided administered LNP types, indicating that the non-specific accumulation of LNPs in normal tissues was ignorable. The quantified fluorescent intensities of the organs also exhibited no statistical difference from one another (Fig. 4d). The utilization of MSC for the intratumoral LNP delivery allowed LNPs to be slowly infused into tumor tissues via their physiological diffusion mechanism, providing them sufficient time for 9 h to spread throughout the tumor tissues. Moreover, LNPs could be administered precisely into the center of tumors through the microchannel of MSC, which promoted their homogenous diffusion to the tumor periphery without any inappropriate delivery to normal tissues. In addition to the infusion control by MSC guidance, the surface chemistry of LNPs further affected their intratumoral distribution, wherein highly cationic LNPs were unevenly dispersed and PEGylated LNPs tend to rapidly elude out from tumors. These data indicate that MSCguided intratumoral administration of LNPs can solve the serious problems of intravenously administered LNPs such as interactions with blood components and entrapment to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) that greatly disturb their passive tumor targeting at targeted tumor tissues.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

            "text": "Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs of LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does not necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mechanism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease. \n\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1).",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

            "text": "The intrahepatic distribution can also be controlled by the proper control of the pK a value and ionization status of LNPs. In a recent study, two lipids, YSK05 and YSK12-C4 (pK a values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively), were mixed in different ratios to produce LNPs with different pK a values. LNPs with a pK a value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (approx. 36% cationic charge) could successfully deliver siRNA to LSECs. On the other hand, LNPs with a pK a value of 6.50 showed maximum gene silencing in hepatocytes. 76) ne important issue to be considered is the toxicity of LNPs based on ionizable lipids used for gene delivery to hepatocytes. The intravenous injection of these LNPs produces various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, several methods were examined to decrease the toxicity of these LNPs. One strategy is based on using biodegradable derivatives of commonly used lipids. A biodegradable version of MC3, called L319, was less efficient in siRNA delivery (IC 50 value of 0.01 mg/kg) but showed an improved safety profile compared with the nonbiodegradable derivative. 77) Similarly, the biodegradability of the CL4H6 lipid increased its tolerability and biosafety compared with the previous generations. 40)  second strategy is based on decreasing the amount of ionizable lipids. This was generally associated with decreased efficiency. The use of protamine for neutralizing the siRNA was used to restore the high efficiency of LNPs prepared with low amounts of ionizable lipids. 78) It was reported that the liver toxicity of injected LNPs is related to the accumulation in LSECs, resulting in an elevation of inflammatory cytokines. 79) Therefore, a third strategy to decrease hepatotoxicity was based on decreasing the delivery to LSECs using ligands for active targeting to hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38]. Moreover, mRNA-loaded LNPs have been prepared by using PEGylated lipids and organic solvents, leading to the assembly of particles with several hundred nanometer diameter and highly cationic \u03b6-potential [39]. Our strategy has potential to prepare sub-100 nm-sized LNPs with neutral surface charge, by mRNA PEGylation alone or by combination with PEGylated lipids. \n\nOur strategy can potentially be applied to polymer-based mRNA carriers, which provide promising alternatives to lipid-based carriers for targeting various tissues other than the liver and the spleen [40][41][42][43], while the liver and the spleen can be more efficiently targeted using LNPs due to their tropism to these organs. By using PEGylated mRNA, the complicated processes of PEG conjugation to polycation can be avoided. Furthermore, as is the case in LNPs, PEGylation of polyplexes is beneficial for their steric stabilization in biological milieu [35,44] and alleviation of mRNA immunogenicity [45]. \n\nIn conclusion, we developed a simple, robust and versatile procedure of mRNA-loaded LNP preparation, providing a smart solution to so far complicated procedures. The PEGylation of mRNA allowed the preparation of size-controlled LNP by mixing two aqueous solutions of mRNA and parent LNP by using pipetting. Importantly, mRNA was successfully PEGylated with minimal influence on its translational activity by hybridizing mRNA with PEGylated short RNA oligonucleotides. The PEGylated LNP thus obtained exhibited high structural stability in blood after intravenous injection, while non-PEGylated LNP rapidly aggregated in blood, presumably causing lung embolism. By providing methods for easy preparation of mRNA LNP for in vivo usage, our approach has the potential to accelerate the widespread clinical use of existing and newly developed mRNA LNP formulations.",

This approach holds the potential to mitigate the undesirable delivery of LNPs to extrahepatic organs, thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is overexpressed on the surface of hepatoma cells. It has been suggested that ASGPR-mediated endocytosis is an effective delivery strategy. 6][167][168] Another idea is to conjugate the LNPs with ASGPR mAb, which may be an attempt. 167 n a study by Kim et al., 169 it was found that achieving LSEC-specific RNA delivery, could not succeed by controlling the size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Due to the specific expression of mannose receptors on human and mouse LSECs, they prepared LNPs doped with 0.5-4.5% mannose PEG-lipid, and found that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) has the best LSECs selective delivery effect. 169,170 Miao et al. 171 have proposed a glycolipid-like polymer named galactosylated chitosan oligosaccharide-SS-octadecylamine (Gal-CSSO). The galactosyl residues modified on it can selectively target HCs, the chitosan oligosaccharide is conducive to the endosomal escape, and the structure of -SS-can help the HC microenvironment respond to facilitate drug release. \n\nMany carriers with excellent liver selective delivery have been approved for drug delivery or have started clinical trials.

            "text": "To compare the efficiency of various GalNAc-LNPs to deliver to the liver in vivo via non-LDLR-dependent pathways, a series of screening experiments were performed in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice. GalNAc-LNPs (Table S1) were formulated with an adenine base editor 8.8-m (ABE8.8) mRNA and a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the mouse Angptl3 or Pcsk9 genes-well-validated therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first such experiment tested GalNAc-Lipids GL3 and GL6, which share the same PEG spacer and lipid anchor but differ in the ligand design. GalNAc-LNPs constituted with 0.05 mol % GL3 or 0.05 mol % GL6 were administered to Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice (N = 5 for each treatment group) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Five to ten days following treatment, scheduled necropsy was performed, and liver editing was assessed via targeted amplicon sequencing. An increased rate of editing was observed for animals treated with the GalNAc-LNP containing GL6, mean 31% versus 23% respectively (p value = 0.0086), as noted in Fig. 1d. A similar pattern was noted in a second experiment comparing GL3 versus GL6 with a guide RNA targeting the Pcsk9 gene, where Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice (N = 5 for each treatment group) were treated at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg. Mean liver editing was again significantly higher in mice treated with the GalNAc-LNP containing GL6 as compared to GL3, mean 43% versus 33%, respectively (p value = 0.01, Fig. 1e). \n\nHaving prioritized the head group of ligand Design 2, we next turned our attention to optimizing the lipid anchor and spacer design. We replaced the average 36-unit PEG linker of GL6 with a 12-unit PEG linker to obtain GL5 (Fig. 1c) to evaluate the effect of spacing between the nanoparticle and the surface-bound ligand.",

Given its widespread application across various drug modalities and delivery systems, PEGylation remains a cornerstone in the refinement of LNP-based therapeutics. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 32 pivotal role in biodistribution, tissue-specific targeting, and overall therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the molar ratio of lipid components is a critical factor in achieving organspecific delivery and warrants further investigation. In summary, these studies demonstrate that subtle physicochemical modifications of cholesterol, the ionization state of lipids, or alterations in individual lipid components can significantly impact the structural and biological properties of LNPs. Advanced methodologies, such as large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and other cutting-edge techniques, hold great potential for guiding the rational design of LNPs to enhance their therapeutic applications. In addition to PEG-lipids, cholesterol, characterized by its rigidity and hydrophobic nature, integrates into the interstitial spaces of lipid membranes, thereby enhancing the stability of LNPs and facilitating their fusion with endosomes [60,61]. Notably, structural modifications of cholesterol can further optimize LNP performance and enable specialized functions. For example, Paunovska et al. demonstrated that esterified cholesterol in LNPs significantly boosted delivery efficiency [62]. Recent research has concentrated on enhancing cholesterol derivatives to optimize LNP performance. These modified cholesterol compounds contribute to the improved stability and prolonged circulation times of LNPs, thereby increasing their delivery efficiency. Choi et al. also achieved a boost in delivery efficiency, though through a distinct approach. Instead of using traditional cholesterol, they employed 3\u03b2-L-histidinamide-carbamoyl cholesterol (Hchol), which demonstrated superior delivery and gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement was attributed to the pH-sensitive protonation of the imidazole groups in the Hchol formulation [63]. Additionally, the modification of cholesterol's charge is crucial for targeting.",

            "text": "In addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.In numerous cases, the carbon anchor length dictates the PEG detachment, as exemplified in LNPs.When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h \u22121 ) to the chain length was observed. [21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

In this way, we gain mechanistic insights into accelerated drug clearance by APA that are otherwise difficult to measure and validate experimentally. \n\nIn the model, consistent with PET/CT studies, we observed that na\u00efve mice exhibited less variability in their optimized parametrizations and maintained nearly constant signals through the first hour. This contrasts with the greater variations in mice with appreciable APA titers, which underscores the complexity of APA-mediated ABC. The liver and spleen ability to retain the PL drug carriers (high retention coefficients Kp li , Kp s ) exhibited the most significant difference between the na\u00efve and APA+ cohorts and subsequently appeared to be the driving parameters in this system, distinguishing the cohorts of mice with and without APA. The liver and spleen permeability to PL, controlled by fr li , fr s, restrict the amount of drug accessible to the liver and spleen; these properties are not greatly affected by APA status, indicating that, mechanistically, the difference in clearance driven by APA is attributed to APA binding to PL and retention of the resulting APA/PL complexes in the liver via uptake by cells such as LSECs or Kupffer cells. However, the APA need not speed the process of exposing different cells in the liver to PL, which would be a process limited by delivery via blood flow or capillary permeability and reflected in greater sensitivity to drug permeability. This was not the case reflected in the model or the data. Increased total drug uptake in the liver and spleen is further evidenced in comparing the time series for PET signal and AUC values between the cohorts. We have identified that the retention process in the liver, attributed in the model to Kp li and caused physiologically by antibodies cross-linking PL in the liver, is primarily responsible for the increased liver uptake. This is the greatest difference between the mice in the APA+ versus na\u00efve cohorts.",

            "text": "Chemical modification with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) is one strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and immunotoxins. PEGylation is routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry to increase the serum halflife and stability of drugs, as evidenced by 14 PEGylated drugs approved by the FDA and many others in human clinical trials [39]. However, such a strategy did not lead to improved clinical efficacy in immunotoxin treatments, even though efficacies observed in preclinical models suggested it a viable option. Site-specific PEGylation of LMB-2 on the lysine residues (anti-CD25-PE38 immunotoxin) led to about a 20-fold increase in therapeutic efficacy, including a 3-4-fold higher anti-tumor activity and about 6-fold reduction in normal tissue toxicity in preclinical mouse models [40]. PEGylation, on one hand, reduced offtarget toxicity caused by the nonspecific binding of LMB-2 to normal tissues such as liver cells [41]. PEGylation of the cytotoxic moiety shields the ionic interactions thus reducing the nonspecific cellular absorption and uptake by normal tissues. The increased molecule size also limits the transport of PEGylated immunotoxin from blood to normal tissues like the lung, kidney and liver [42]. On the other hand, PEGylation increases serum half-life and stability of immunotoxin while reducing immunogenicity. The same strategy was used to reduce the antigen-independent toxicity of a non-binding ADC with a hydrophobic MMAE payload [43]. Similarly, shielding of the hydrophobic payload with optimal PEGylation reduced systemic toxicity by slower clearance and dramatically decreased nonspecific cellular uptake in normal tissues (Fig. 1A) [43]. Even though PEGylation improves the therapeutic efficacy of a drug, this technology is also facing many challenges [44]. The steric hindrance caused by long PEG chains may either interfere with the targeting moiety binding to its receptor or limit the furin cleavage efficiency of pseudomonas exotoxin.",

            "text": "The biodistribution profile of a given drug is important for its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Although studies on the biodistribution of intratracheal and intravenous injection of PEGylated GNPs have been reported [28], our study herein presented a systematic comparison on the biodistribution of a therapeutic nanoparticle among i.t., i.v. and i.p. administration to establish the correlation between the biodistribution profiles and their therapeutic effectiveness. Our results demonstrated that the i.t. administration allowed P12 mainly to be accumulated in the lung, while i.v. and i.p. administration let P12 primarily target the liver and the lymph nodes, respectively (Fig. 5a-c). Such a favorable biodistribution of P12 via i.t. administration is probably why it is more effective than other routes of administration to reduce LPS-induced ALI (Figs. 2, 3, 4). \n\nIt should be mentioned that although the amount of P12 in the lung (dark color) seemed to be high at 4 h post administration (Fig. 5i), we found that P12 could be quickly excreted out of the ALI mice 24 h after administration at which only about 5% of the injected dose were remained in the lung; this value was further decreased to about 0.5% after one month [19]. Furthermore, P12 was not toxic to human and murine macrophages (i.e. THP-1 cell derived macrophages and BMDMs) at the concentration used in this study [16,18], and no obvious in vivo toxicity was observed throughout the experiments. Currently, we are conducting a more thorough in vivo biosafety studies to provide more insights for its future translational potentials. \n\nAlthough nanotherapeutics are known for their better tumor targeting capability to treat cancer, extensive studies have shown that nanoparticles can still largely accumulate in the liver because they are easy to be trapped by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS, also known as RES) [29]. Even with PEGylation strategy, there are still about 60% of GNPs trapped in the MPS organs like liver and spleen after i.v.",

            "text": "This result reflects the observations made in the confocal experiments described above. Internalisation of NP into MDA-MB-468 cells was reduced as the PEG length of the NP increased (15.3% 111 In-EGF-Au was internalised, compared to 15.1%, 13.2% and 11.1% of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG800, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG2000 and 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000, respectively). One possible explanation for this modest reduction in internalisation is that longer PEG chains cause minor steric hindrance that interferes with binding of NP to the EGFR. \n\nTaking the in vitro data together, 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 was selected for in vivo experiments. It was considered that the slightly reduced cellular uptake of this construct would be offset by the reduction in opsonisation and, therefore, lower liver uptake, resulting from its effective surface coating and small negative charge. This was expected to result in prolonged circulation time and, therefore, more efficient tumour accumulation compared to the other constructs.",

            "text": "The present study illustrates the differences in biodistribution patterns following i.v. and oral routes of administration of two doses of PEG-PLA NPs. The higher concentration of radiolabeled NPs in blood compared to RES organs indicated the enhanced systemic circulation of these NPs following i.v. injection. Moreover, a dose-dependent distribution of NPs to the blood and RES organs following i.v. injection was observed. Furthermore, an increased distribution of NPs with time following oral administration to the organs such as the heart, lung, liver, spleen, muscle, bone and brain suggests their absorption after oral route. Such differences in the biodistribution profile following i.v. and oral administration routes could be due to the variations in the distributed concentrations of NPs to these organs. PEG-PLA NPs may thus consider as safe nanocarriers due to their hemocompatibility and potential to balance the oxidative stress. Even though PEG-PLA NPs induced DNA damage in the tested organs, no notable cell death was observed, indicating their compatibility at the tissue level. It is expected that an understanding of the biological interactions of the NPs, the consequences, and the associated mechanisms in vivo may considerably help in anticipating the safety of NPs. These investigations are expected to provide key information on the influence of administration route and dose on biodistribution profile and also on the resulting consequences of the nanoparticles' interaction with the biological components. A thorough understanding of the relationship between physicochemistry and pharmacokinetic profile of the carrier in preclinical models is essential to predict the efficacy and safety of the carrier, which would allow design of safer nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery systems suitable for human application.",

In both cases, MS2 accumulated primarily in the liver and the spleen. 114,121 PEGylation of MS2 was also studied since PEG has been shown to act as a \"stealth agent\" to avoid immune clearance. 121 PEGylated MS2 VLPs behaved similarly, except retention in the spleen was significantly reduced. 121 This ability to avoid the immune system is extremely valuable as it will likely increase the effective dose that reaches the targeted tissue. Furthermore, work has shown that the CD47 ectodomain or the CD47 \"self-peptide,\" which has been displayed on VLPs, can also be used to avoid the immune system. 106 Qb, labeled externally with gadolinium, was also studied in mice at 4-5 hr after intravenous administration. 97 Qb VLPs accumulated in the liver, but unlike MS2, accumulated at lower levels in the spleen. 97 The biodistribution of the plant virus-based VLPs, CCMV, and CPMV, intravenously injected in mice at various times, are mostly similar. They primarily accumulate in the liver, spleen, kidney, and GI tract. 61,103,[133][134][135] CCMV, labeled with 125I, also showed significant retention by the thyroid, probably due to the iodine. 61 PEGylation of CPMV VLPs greatly reduced accumulation in the liver and spleen, which suggests CCMV and CPMV could also benefit from the CD47 ectodomain displayed on the surface to avoid the immune system. 106,134 Because developing VLP-based targeted therapies for cancer is a primary application, biodistribution studies in mice possessing",

These changes have the effect of producing LNPs that are typically larger (in the 120-160nm range as compared to 60-100nm range) and which are more negatively charged than standard LNPs. By considering the available surface area and availability of PEGylated lipids, we estimate that, before administration, our LNPs have a reduced mantle of PEG at the LNP-water interface, which may affect uptake by phagocytic cells. However, we recognize that the surface properties of DMG-PEG2000-coated LNPs will be substantially changed, by interaction with lipoproteins and plasma proteins, when they reach the blood circulation after IM injection (30). \n\nThe modifications in lipid molar ratios we made to the standard LNP formula were based on our previous, as yet unpublished, observations (27,31). Prior to our work on the COVID vaccine we were investigating the effect of size, charge and PEGylated lipid content on biodistribution. We found that after intravenous (IV) injection, larger, more negatively charged particles are extracted to a lesser extent by the mouse liver. This results in a higher extent of mRNA translation in spleen versus liver (27,31). We posit that this redistribution, and reduction in liver uptake, is desirable for vaccination, in contrast with the aim of the Onpattro product which was designed for delivery of siRNA to the liver (28). \n\nThe spleen/liver redistribution is evident when the PEGylated lipid content is reduced within the range 0.15-0.25 mole% PEGylated lipid and with N/P ratio = 5 (27,31). We found that redistribution correlated with improved translation of reporter mRNA in phagocytic cells in the spleen and improved cell-mediated responses to vaccination of mice with mRNA encoding ovalbumin.",

To reveal this involvement, they used GSK264220A (an inhibitor of both LPL and EL) and orlistat (an inhibitor of LPL only) as co-treatments. Considering that EL is principally an A1 phospholipase (PLA1) and GSK264220A inhibits EL activity [98], and that PLA1 activity of HL was much lower than that of EL [118]. It was suggested that the LNPs are being deactivated by the PLA1 activity of the EL [97]. A potential strategy for non-hepatocyte delivery is to deviate from ApoE-dependent pathways of delivery by increasing the PEG-lipid content in LNPs, which was not successful in terms of prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets [119]. Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120]. Moreover, successful localization of LNP-siRNAs to the antigen-presenting cells' cytoplasm has been reported [121].",

While there now exists a greater understanding regarding the utility of mRNA-based medicines, the biodistribution profiles of LNPs and their constituents as well as the drivers influencing their biodistribution are less well understood. With the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic mRNA-LNP modalities, many of which incorporate xenobiotic constituents, an in-depth biodistribution profile analysis is necessary to understand the in vivo fates and factors that influence the in vivo exposure of these medicines and their constituents. These data will inform the evolving clinical evaluation strategy as well as providing insight into future mRNA-LNP product development. In this study, we showed that after intravenous administration of Lipid 5, a xenobiotic amino lipid used in LNP formulations rapidly distributes throughout rat tissues in vivo, with exposure directed primarily toward the liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys. In addition, we showed that Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites are undetectable in most tissues within 7 days (168 hours). Our findings showed similar distribution profiles in both male and female, pigmented and nonpigmented rats, suggesting minimal influence of sex or pigmentation in exposure of Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites. The findings support the use of non-radioactive analyses in rat biodistribution models to assess the efficacy and safety of Lipid 5-containing LNPs in a preclinical setting.\n\nThe tissue distribution analysis using [ 14 C]Lipid 5-containing LNPs showed rapid distribution of Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites throughout all tissues tested within the first hour, localizing primarily in the digestive and urinary systems (Figs. 2 and 3). Ten hours after intravenous LNP administration, the majority of the remaining radioactivity was eliminated from the peripheral tissues and was concentrated primarily in the digestive system (intestines, intestinal lumen, and other organs that facilitate metabolism and excretion of xenobiotic",

Nucleic acid delivery to activated HSCs is believed to reduce fibrosis by regulating fibrogenic cytokines [139,140].\n\nFor example, Sato et al. accomplished HSC-targeted delivery of liposomes and LNPs by decorating the particle surface with vitamin A [64,141]. As HSCs are a main storage for vitamin A, uptake of the liposomes was mediated by retinol binding receptor, which led to suppression of cirrhosis in a cirrhotic liver rat model by delivering therapeutic siRNA [64] and showed ability to promote regeneration of chronically injured liver [141]. Fibrotic HSCs were moreover targeted by modification of siRNA-LNPs with a cyclic peptide ligand (pPB) that interacts with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2. It could be observed that pPB-targeted LNPs accumulated with high specificity in HSCs confirmed by biodistribution experiments after systemic injection [83].\n\nStudies conducted by the Dahlman group using the barcode technology described before for in vivo screening of lipid compositions aimed for delivery of chemically different LNP formulations beyond hepatocytes and the understanding of particle distribution in the liver microenvironment without the requirement for additional receptor-targeting ligands [142].",

[173] PEG-conjugated LNPs benefit from reduced protein opsonization and increased circulation times where the PEG layer provides hydrophilic steric hindrance and acts as a stealth coating. Unfortunately, the issues related to PEG activity and safety are still unclear. Low transfection potency and cellular uptake are two of the drawbacks associated with the presence of PEG in LNP formulation. To deal with this contradiction, a dynamic PEGylation strategy is being used via nanoparticle surface decoration with cleavable pH-responsive PEG. [174] A notable feature of this strategy is sequential-targeting which involves a two-stage consequent passive and active targeting. The latter occurs when the ligands of a PEG-surface-functionalized nanoparticle are being exposed as a result of pH-triggered de-PEGylation in acidic media. The exposed ligands, at that point, perform an active targeting. Nevertheless, this strategy is well suited for cancer therapies, where the tumor microenvironments are slightly acidic which has prompted many studies considering PEG substitution with amino acid-derived polypeptides. For instance, Nogueira et al. selected polysarcosine (pSar) as a PEG substitute due to its stealth-like characteristic. pSar is made of endogenous amino acid sarcosine (N-methylated glycine) repetitive units and shows no acute immune response and low immunogenicity. [175] Other amino acid-based PEG substitute peptides are gemini surfactants derived from serine. Three variants of this surfactant, namely (12Ser)2N12 (amine derivative), (12Ser)2COO12 (ester derivative), and (12Ser)2CON12 (amide derivative), were investigated for siRNA delivery in combination with monoolein, a neutral single-tailed unsaturated lipid. The selection of monoolein was based on its potential to increase the cationic surfactant transfection efficiency by improving both the system's stability in physiological conditions and the endosomal escape ability. [176] Despite all the reported shortcomings of PEG in LNP formulation, research into the chemical structure of this polymer has continued. Linear-",

            "text": "This heightened reactogenicity was consistent with our measurements of cytokine secretion as well [29].In another scenario, the replacement of the helper DSPC lipid with DOPE (in LM1 and LM2, respectively) may lead to differences in expression and biodistribution after intramuscular injection.DSPC formulations predominantly express mRNA in the liver, while the DOPE formulation showed a significant signal in the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes.This contrasts with observations presented by Chandre et al. from intravenous administration, which suggested that DSPC-containing LNPs mostly accumulated in the spleen, whereas identical LNPs substituting DSPC with the helper lipid DOPE preferentially accumulated in the liver [31].One of the most interesting findings of our study lies in the replacement of the PEG-lipid.Specifically, LM1 contained the PEG-lipid ALC-0159, while LM3 was composed of DMG-PEG2k.Those molecules, with their distinct molecular structures, consist of a lipid structure O-pegylated to a PEG chain with a mass of approximately 2 kDa.The lipid component of ALC-0159 is the N,N-dimyristylamide of 2-hydroxyacetic acid, an amide derivative of 2-hydroxyacetic acid (also known as glycolic acid), combined with two myristyl (tetradecyl) chains.In contrast, DMG-PEG2k comprises myristoyl diglyceride, featuring a glycerol backbone with two fatty acid chains, one of which is myristoyl (tetradecanoyl).This difference in the PEG-lipid nature alone significantly modified the LNP structure, immune response profile, biodistribution, and mRNA expression levels, despite both lipids possessing the same degree of PEGylation and the particles having the same size, which are well-known factors affecting LNP distribution and immunogenicity [4,32].\n\nConsidering that most treatments for metabolic diseases involve replacing defective genes with functional enzymes, we have demonstrated that our LNPs successfully express Luc from Luc mRNA.",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

            "text": "The relevance of extracellular traps on the in vivo fate of nanoparticles remains unclear. \n\nIn vivo, the involvement of the MPS on the clearance of nanomedicines was evidenced notably by studying the impact of the dose on circulation times 41,42 . For nanoparticles with no steric protection (i.e., high intrinsic clearance), independent studies showed that augmenting the injected dose resulted in non-linear increase in blood exposure 41e44 . This phenomenon was attributed to the limited quantity of opsonins available in the bloodstream 41 or to the saturation of liver Kupffer cells and other phagocytes 42e44 . Interestingly, for nanoparticles which have lower affinity for the MPS due to their steric protection (i.e., PEGylated), increasing the dose within a 100-fold range did not prolong circulation times 42,43 . Recently, our group confirmed that a threshold of approximately 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 might be necessary to prevent early clearance of polymer nanoparticles by the MPS, but that higher PEGylation densities did not necessarily translate into higher blood exposure 45 . \n\nVarious groups have highlighted the importance of circumventing distribution to the MPS to increase the efficacy of therapeutic nanomedicines. For example, the injection of large liposomes containing clodronate can efficiently deplete Kupffer cells in the liver 46 . This model was used to increase the circulation times and tumor distribution of PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes and other types of nanoparticles 47,48 . Although this strategy can result in increased therapeutic efficacy 47 , its clinical relevance remains questionable as it might also make animals (and potentially humans) more susceptible to bacterial infections 47 . Interestingly, in both aforementioned studies, the depletion of Kupffer cells resulted in increased splenic distribution 47,48 . This supports the role of the spleen to sieve colloids that are not efficiently retained by the liver 49 . \n\nDecoy colloids can also be used to partially bypass the MPS.",

            "text": "For any given selected GalNAc-Lipid, several strategies for incorporation in the LNP during the manufacturing process warrant consideration. Initial attempts to incorporate the GalNAc-Lipid after LNP formulation resulted in a non-uniform distribution of GalNAc-Lipid in the drug product, as assessed based on a lectin binding assay (Supplementary Fig. 2). As an alternative, we formulated the GalNAc-LNP by mixing the GalNAc-Lipid with other lipid excipients prior to LNP particle formation and generated stable particles which produced similar efficacy in mice (Supplementary Fig. 3) and allowed for efficient scaleup to larger batch sizes. \n\nTo optimize the surface density of GalNAc-ligand required for efficient ASGPR recognition, molar percentages of GalNAc-Lipid ranging from 0 to 1% were assessed in vivo in both wild-type (WT) and Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2b). As expected, minimal Angptl3 editing was observed in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice using an LNP with 0% GalNAc-Lipid, with mean editing of 1.3%, but as little as 0.01 mol % GalNAc-Lipid substantially rescued editing to a mean of 26.3% and inclusion of 0.05 mol % produced the highest mean editing of 31.4%. Increasing the density of GalNAc-ligand on the LNP surface decreased efficacy in both WT and Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice. This titration of ligand surface density indicated crowding the LNP surface with ligand is detrimental to the ASGPR-mediated uptake of GalNAc-LNP. \n\nTo study the potency of standard and GalNAc-LNPs across the full range of normal LDLR activity, heterozygous deficiency, and homozygous deficiency, an additional mouse screening experiment was conducted. We dosed Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 , Ldlr +/-, and WT mice with 0.25 mg/kg of LNPs formulated with and without 0.05 mol% GalNAc-Lipid GL6.",

            "text": "\u2212121 Key aspects such as blood clearance rates, retention times at target sites, and physiological interactions with the host system are still insufficiently studied. Without a clear understanding of how DNs behave over extended periods in vivo, including their biodistribution, degradation pathways, and possible accumulation in off-target tissues, it is difficult to predict their long-term safety profile. \n\nIt is worth noting here, that combining in vivo delivery with organelle-targeted delivery presents several challenges in achieving both effective systemic distribution and precise targeting of therapeutics to specific organelles within cells. 48,100,101 While in vivo delivery systems are designed to facilitate broad distribution throughout the body, organelletargeted systems require a level of specificity that often limits their systemic circulation time. 48,100,101 For instance, nanoparticles can be engineered to improve their physicochemical properties for better tissue targeting. 191 However, achieving organelle specificity typically necessitates modifications that can hinder their ability to circulate effectively in vivo. 191 Additionally, targeting specific organelles, such as mitochondria, presents further challenges. The mitochondrion double membrane and negative potential must be overcome to deliver therapeutics effectively. 192 Lipophilic cations, particularly triphenylphosphonium, have proven to be effective vehicles for mitochondrial delivery due to their ability to permeate cellular membranes and accumulate within mitochondria. 192 However, successful mitochondrial targeting often requires functionalization with ligands that possess both positive charge and hydrophobicity. 192 hile positively charged materials can enhance targeting, they may also accumulate in organs like the lungs and liver, potentially causing toxicity during in vivo delivery. 193 Surface modifications, such as PEGylation or controlled oxidation, can mitigate this acute toxicity while maintaining delivery efficacy. 194  promising approach to address these challenges is the use of dynamic delivery strategies. Dynamic DNs, which undergo environment-responsive structural and functional transformations, can be tailored to exhibit properties suited to different stages of the delivery process. For example, the development of stimulus-responsive DNs capable of responding to biomolecules like nucleic acids and proteins, as well as biophysical environmental factors such as temperature and pH, offers a potential solution for enhancing the precision and efficacy of therapeutic delivery. 195",

            "text": "To date, the liver, lung, and spleen are commonly targeted organs in current research, however, targeting other organs such as the eyes, skin, heart, and brain holds great potential but remains more challenging in clinical applications. \n\nDespite the translation potential, most LNPs tend to accumulate in the liver, and overcoming the natural liver targeting characteristics of LNPs has become a key challenge in nano-vector research. Recently, Sahay group developed LNPs decorated with an oligomer peptide to deliver mRNA to neural retina in rodents and non-human primates after intravitreal administration. This breakthrough demonstrates the potential of LNP-mRNA in the treatment of inherited retinal diseases and represents significant progress in LNP penetrating biological barriers to achieve extrahepatic targeting [138]. Xue et al. synthesized a series of LNPs with bisphosphonate (BP)-lipid, which showed higher affinity for bone-related fragments in vitro and higher bone-targeting in vivo compared to LNPs without BP-lipid [139]. Another example of extrahepatic targeting involves decorating LNPs with CD5 antibody to produce CAR T cells transiently by delivering mRNA to target T cells. In a mouse model of heart disease, the targeted-LNPs encapsulating modified-mRNA could reduce the fibrosis degree of heart and restore heart function [140]. \n\nThe skin is the largest organ in the human body and skin aging is related closely to the fibroblast in dermis. Recently, Francisco and Ferreira designed hundreds of polymers and selected six polymers with similar chemical structures composed of diacrylate, special amine, and bisacrylamide, which could transfect mouse fibroblasts with high efficiency in vitro. Among them, P1E28 containing alkyl alcohol side chain and piperazine rings with two tertiary amines showed the highest transfected efficiency. In vivo results showed that P1E28 polymeric nanoparticles delivered Cre mRNA to skin dermal fibroblasts with a higher delivery efficiency than endothelial cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.",

In HEK-293-hACE2 cells, both LNP-Trim1 and LNP-Trim2 at 40 nM siRNA concentration produced maximum knockdown (\u226570%) of the target genes (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) at the mRNA level 72 hours after transfection (Figure 5A and B). In Calu-3 cells transfected with LNP-si ACE2 (40 nM siACE2), the cell internalization/localization of LNPs were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Figure S3). Cell association of LNP-Trim was observed as early as one hour (Figure S3A-C). At three (Figure S3D-F) and six (Figure S3G-I) hours time points, a uniform LNP internalization in punctate form was observed, indicating endosomal localization.

These lipids are probably cleared from the body after entering the intrinsic lipid metabolic pathways.

[56,57] The results of in vivo delivery experiments are consistent with this assumption (Figure 8b,c). However, the distribution of mRNA is highly dependent on the molecular structure of the ionizable materials being used [18] and/or the composition of the formulation. [58,59] hus, the possibility that the LNP ssPalmO-Phe could reach unintended targets in the body and affect their function cannot be completely ruled out.

Dendrimers have delivered RNA to the central nervous system 168 , acted as intramuscular vaccines against the Ebola and H1N1 viruses 169 , and deli vered siRNA to hepatic endothelial cells 170 . Dendrimer structure has also been modified to protect nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation 171 and to enhance endosomal escape 172 .\n\nActive versus passive tissue targeting Passive tissue targeting. As outlined in the section 'Lipids and lipid-based nanoparticles' , research has demonstrated that LNPs originally developed for liver siRNA or mRNA delivery can be redirected to other organs without the need for antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers or other active targeting ligands that bind specific receptors on the surface of target cells 173 . For the purposes of this Review, we define such retargeting, probably driven by interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins in endogenous trafficking pathways, as a process termed 'passive targeting' or 'endogenous targeting' (Fig. 4a). As a sphere becomes smaller, its surface area to volume ratio increases; as a result, nanoparticles have large surface areas 174 and when a nanoparticle comes into contact with a biological milieu, many biomolecules can coat its surface 175 . By covering the nanoparticle surface, these coronas (proteins that bind to the nanoparticle surface) change the chemical and biological molecules at the surface of the nanoparticle, thereby altering how the nanoparticle interacts with immune cells 176 and on-target tissues 177 . In one clinical example 178 , apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption was required for ionizable, but not cationic, lipids to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes 179 . Researchers have found LNPs that can be trafficked via an albumin-dependent mechanism 180 as well as LNPs with variable dependence on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and caveolin-1 receptors 136,181 . In addition to the effect that the protein corona can have on LNP tropism, LNP size can also contribute to passive tissue targeting.\n\nIn one example,",

            "text": "NPs deployed in vivo can be protected from the immune system using various types of coating. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used widely because it is biocompatible, chemically inert, and soluble in water and organic solvent [48]. PEG can also reduce phagocytic uptake, thereby prolonging the halflives of NPs in a mechanism called the stealth effect [49]. PEGylated NPs generally accumulate in the liver at one-half to one-third of the amount compared to non-PEGylated NPs [50] and gave a significant reduction of accumulation in the spleen, liver, and pancreas [51]. Similarly, when coating NPs with other types of coating such as breviscapine (BVP), researchers found that the NPs were mainly distributed in the liver, spleen, heart, and brain [52].\n\nDespite the advantages of using PEG as coating, several new reviews describe the immunogenic properties of PEG which is characterized by the production of antibodies against PEG after the first injection of PEG-NPs. is causes accelerated blood clearance (ABC) after the second injection [53][54][55]. One possible approach to reduce the immunological issues is to use immunosuppressive agents specific against PEG. For example, Tung et al. developed hybrid antibodies that can selectively deliver PEGylated medicine to the target cells [56]. Another strategy is the use of novel hydrophilic polymers other than PEG including BVP, polymeric NP, Poly (hydroxyethyl-L-asparagine), protein polymer, poly (amino acid) based stealth liposome [55], and zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine [57][58][59][60].\n\nMany factors affect the PEGylation of NPs including the PEG polymer identity, the composition, density, hydrophobicity, and the nature of the proteins. ese criteria should be properly regulated and adapted to avoid unfavorable effects of PEGylation [61]. NPs coated with lower molecular weight PEG were eliminated quickly from circulation [61].\n\nIn Table 3, we summarize the effect of using different types NPs coating on biodistri",

Although the LNPs described here, similar to other nanoparticle delivery systems, yield liver delivery, our top LNP A10 resulted in the lowest liver:placenta ratio compared to the other formulations tested. In the future, we will incorporate targeting ligands into LNPs to improve placental targeting and minimize off-target effects to maternal tissues. Finally, our biodistribution results using luciferase mRNA encapsulated in LNPs demonstrated no delivery of LNPs to the fetus. This, combined with our toxicity analysis, suggests no adverse effects of LNPs to fetuses. These results support the use of LNPs, and in particular, LNP A10, for mRNA delivery to the placenta to treat diseases that originate from placental dysfunction.",

            "text": "LNPs are becoming a central DDS platform for delivering lipophilic drugs with a low water solubility. Over the past decades, LNPs have been subdivided into different materials and synthetic methods depending on the desired purpose. Among them, LNPs with various core types, ranging from traditional nano-emulsions with liquid cores to cubosomes with a hollow core, have been developed to improve the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs. Through these efforts, LNPs have overcome the existing limitations of DDSs and proved to be the most suitable for lipophilic drug delivery. \n\nLNP-based therapeutics, including various lipophilic drugs, are being developed for treating diseases. However, to commercialize them as ideal DDS carriers, many challenging tasks, such as the targeting ability, cell penetration, and endosome escape, remain. To solve these problems, the complete application of surface modification, which provides a special function by modifying the membrane of the carrier, has been proposed. Various surface modifications have been developed to make LNPs highly functional, ranging from PEGylation, which is most commonly used in LNP-based DDS, to surfactant proteins that have recently emerged. Various surface modifiers impart stability and targeting ability to LNPs to minimize side effects and hide them from the immune system, resulting in a longer residence time in the body. In addition, surface modifications using materials with special functions, such as bio-adhesives and endosome escape, increase the LNP absorption rate in vivo. \n\nIn conclusion, a number of recent LNPs studies suggest that LNPs and surface modifications can significantly improve the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs. However, the potential side-effects, such as allergic reactions to LNPs and the difficulty of scale-up of most surface modifications, remain a major obstacle to their commercialization. If these problems are solved through many clinical studies of LNPs and optimization of the surface",

We found that PEGylation increases both the targeting percentage and strength as it, likely, delays nanoparticle clearance in circulation before reaching pulmonary endothelium, while fluorination exerts a similar effect on the nanoparticles in vivo. The underlying mechanism for the nanoparticle targeting to microvascular endothelium was discussed in our previous studies [16,39], emphasizing that the efficiency of endothelial targeting is highly dependent on the size and surface charge of the nanoparticles due to interactions between the nanoparticles and the microvascular bed. The PBAE nanoparticles were primarily located in the lung microvasculature as supported by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry for CAP1 and CAP2 lung capillary endothelial cells. Moreover, the nanoparticle size and charge influence the bio-distribution of the nanoparticles and are dependent on NP/DNA ratio. Interestingly, in vivo luciferase imaging demonstrated that at low NP/DNA ratio of 10, the nanoparticles have a relatively large size (135.83 \u00b1 2.41 nm), and the transfection occurs mainly in the spleen. With the increase of NP/DNA ratio to 50, the size of the nanoparticles was reduced (86.00 \u00b1 0.32 nm) dramatically, changing bioluminescence distribution in which the lung becomes the major targeted organ. Additional isotope studies are needed to investigate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, our IVIS and Micro-CT results indicate that the nanoparticles are capable of delivering the report plasmids and transfecting the cells in the lung-specific manner. The transfection patterns and organ specificity of nanoparticles in vivo can be controlled by modifying the backbone structures of the nanoparticles, adjusting the contents of capping agents, and optimizing the polymer-to-nucleic acid ratio. Our results consistent with published studies demonstrated that the size of the nanoparticles is important for its in vivo fate because the liver and spleen can trap particles with larger sizes [68,69]. It was also found that larger nanoparticles",

            "text": "In doing so, NPs are said to gain a \"stealth\" attribute and can remain in circulation for longer periods of time, increasing their chances of reaching target sites. This feature was best demonstrated by Doxil, whereby PEGylation extended the half-life from minutes to hours (Gabizon, Shmeeda, & Barenholz, 2003). The impact of PEGylation varies for NPs differing in shape, size, and surface charge. PEGylation of smaller NPs results in a higher surface PEG density (larger hydrodynamic volume), meaning they are more readily able to evade clearance by the MPS (Alexis, Pridgen, Molnar, & Farokhzad, 2008;Walkey, Olsen, Guo, Emili, & Chan, 2012). To specifically study the effect of surface charge on MPS uptake, K. Xiao et al. (2011) were able to demonstrate that NPs with high negative or positive charges were taken up by murine macrophages in vitro as well as in vivo. Other surface modifications have included zwitterionic ligands, hydrophilic sugar coatings (dextran10) and the use of biological proteins (INNO-206), but PEG remains the most widely used conjugation technique. Several PEGylated NPs loaded with chemotherapeutic agents have displayed selective tumor accumulation and enhanced inhibition in various xenografted models of CRC liver metastases (B. L. Chen et al., 2016;Luo et al., 2018;Pohlen, Buhr, & Berger, 2011;H. Zhang et al., 2015). Such results demonstrate the advantages of PEGylated over non-PEGylated drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. Of note, EZN-2208 is a PEGylated prodrug loaded with SN-38 that showed prolonged circulation in various preclinical tumor xenograft models in comparison to free drug. PEG was attached in a manner that stabilized the drug, maintaining its active conformation (Gritli et al., 2016;Sapra et al., 2008).",

The rate of drug absorption is indicated by T max (peak time); C max is the peak plasma concentration systematically indicating sufficient drug absorption to provide an effective therapeutic response. The measure of the extent of absorption or the drug amount in systemic circulation was indicated by AUC 0-t . Here, the increased AUC 0-t values for both nontargeted (218.62\u00b148.6 \u00b5g/mL/h) and targeted (246.25\u00b117.94 \u00b5g/mL/h) Nps indicated enhanced systemic availability of the drugs, which was not achieved by the free drug solutions (free DOCT: 19.31\u00b11.32 \u00b5g/mL/h). This along with the significantly higher mean resident time values for the Nps collectively suggested an increased and prolonged pharmacokinetic effect when administered intravenously. The enhanced t 1/2 and K el values support the fact that the Nps resulted in longer circulation in vivo. 9,56 he organ distribution data showed early liver accumulation for free DOCT and it was reduced over time, which suggested hepatic metabolism of DOCT. The nanoformulated DOCT was observed to accumulate in all of the tested organs, but at a reduced level compared with that of free DOCT. The presence of DOCT was detected even after 24 h in the organs, indicating the presence of Nps in circulation, which could slowly release the drugs. DOCT accumulation was observed in reticulo endothelial system (RES) organs (liver and spleen), kidneys and in highly perfused organs such as the lungs and heart. 25,57 No significant difference in the pattern of distribution between targeted and nontargeted Nps was observed. These nanoformulations could be validated in a suitable cancer model to obtain a clear understanding of their fate.",

Our data showed that P12 accumulated much more in the lung and much less in the liver, spleen and LN when administrated through the airway compared with the i.p. and i.v. routes (Figs. 5  and 7), suggesting that pulmonary delivery of P12 may have relatively lower hepatic toxicity and side effects while having a higher bioavailability in the lung, which is ideal to treat inflammatory lung diseases. On the other hand, P12 had favor accumulation in the liver through i.v. administration, which may be potentially used to treat inflammatory liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis [30,31]. By analogy, the higher concentration of P12 in LN through i.p. administration may be applicable for treating chest lymph node metastasis [32]. Taken together, the observed distinct biodistribution profiles of P12 with different administration routes expand the therapeutic application of P12 for different diseases.",

Moreover, PEGylation can help NPs escape from the mononuclear phagocytic system with prolonged blood circulation. 12,15,16 For example, it was experimentally demonstrated that the half clearance time of PEG during blood circulation was prolonged from 30 minutes to 24 hours with the increase of molecular weight from a few thousands to a few hundred thousand by reducing and slowing down RES uptake. [15][16][17] As a result, it is deduced that the circulation time of PEG-modified IONPs can be regulated by utilizing PEG of different molecular weight, similar to that reported for gold NPs and hydrogel particle replication in nonwetting templates NPs. 4,18 Although both the size of the NPs and surface PEG modification can extend the blood circulation time, early extant literature has reported controversial findings regarding whether the core size or PEG surface should be the dominant factor to prolong the circulation time of IONPs. 13,[19][20][21] Since intravenously injected IONPs are delivered to different tissues and organs by blood circulation in vivo, blood circulation time can affect the dynamic distribution and metabolism in organs. Despite that PEG-modified IONPs have been extensively shown to act as an imaging or hyperthermia agent, the dynamic distribution and metabolism of PEGylated NPs in vital organs and tissues remain unclear. 3,10,12 It is thus essential to investigate the influence of core size and PEG coating on in vivo dynamic distribution and metabolism in vital organs, as well as the circulation time, for future potential clinical trials.\n\nIn the present study, highly monodisperse IONPs with different core sizes and PEG molecules were prepared, and their biodistribution and metabolism were investigated systematically in vivo. They were injected via the tail vein into Kunming mice at a dose of 5 mg Fe/kg per mouse according to the dose requirement of MRI imaging and biosafety in vivo. 22 The effects of core size and PEG-modified surface on blood circulation, biodistribution, and metabolism were elucidated.

PEG-HSPC liposomes were administered as the pre-dose since results from initial work described above showed no impact of DNA-LNP on the pharmacokinetics of PLD.

            "text": "There are many Discussions about how the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution depend on the size and charge of NPs have been ongoing for many years. These characteristics are often discussed in light of the density, chain lengths, and other properties of attached PEGcontaining molecules, with a particular focus on how the PEG chains affect the binding of proteins (i.e., the protein corona) to the NPs (see e.g., [29][30][31][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]). The protein corona described in these studies often consists of proteins involved in complement activation, blood coagulation, macrophage uptake, and lipid metabolism. There are many speculations about how these proteins can contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and biological effects of NPs. Notably, it has been reported that there are differences between the protein corona obtained in vitro (mice plasma) and in vivo in mice [45]. Thus, more studies are needed to investigate whether in vitro protein binding data of NPs can explain their in vivo behavior. Uptake of NPs by the residential liver and spleen macrophages, i.e., uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) earlier often called the reticuloendothelial system (RES), is frequently reported to account for the removal from circulation of most NPs in vivo [29][30][31]43,44]. This includes the quantitative biodistribution study in humans of radioactively labeled liposomes similar to Doxil \u00ae /Caelyx \u00ae [46]. \n\nIt is possible that different proteins associated with the three PACA NPs studied here may contribute to the observed differences in biodistribution. However, as discussed above, we are far from understanding how the protein coronas may contribute to such large variations. We find it especially surprising to see such large differences in biodistribution with our three PACA NPs, with a similar size distribution, charge, and number of ethylene units on the surface (Table 1).",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

The time course of PEG-AuNPs burden in individual tissues is depicted in Figure 2. It is evident that compared to AuNPs of similar diameter coated with triphenylphosphine mono-sulfonate [21,27] or dextran [28], the surface modification with PEG prolonged the circulation time with a blood half-life of 57 h (non-PBPK two-compartment model). Nonetheless, in line with the above-referenced studies, the liver and spleen were the primary sites of NPs accumulation. The dose recovery after 1 h in the blood and four tissues analyzed in our study was 89%; however, this decreased significantly to 30% and 16% after 4 h and 672 h, respectively. Thus, the NPs were either excreted via bile or transported into other tissues (the remainder). The main disadvantage of such a non-mechanistic model resides in the unclear physical meaning of its parameters. In this case, the values of R c:m only reflect the overall affinity of a particular cell line towards PEG-AuNPs accumulation, irrespective of the underlying transport mechanisms. However, they can be used to predict concentration-time curves with R c:m as a surrogate to the partition coefficient in vivo.",

            "text": "PK profiles and biodistributions were evaluated using two types of NPs prepared by different conditions (Figure 7 and Table 3). NP Dense-Large showed higher plasma AUCs of both 111 In-SC-PEG NPs and 14 C-TAM, and lower accumulations in the liver and spleen. These results suggest that higher PEG densities contribute to the reduction in distributions to these tissues due to the less exposed hydrophobic surface, which leads to the decreased clearance of NPs from blood. The CL tot of NPs also supported this hypothesis. Previous studies also reported that PEG-dense NPs reduce the protein corona, which leads to recognition of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and shortened duration of circulation [7,44]. Hydrodynamic diameters are also reportedly governed by specific surface area in the case of red blood cell membrane-coated NPs [41]. In contrast, the difference between NP Sparse-Small and NP Dense-Large was 61 nm and 105 nm, respectively; it was also reported that this difference was not critical for RES recognition [7,45]. A size-dependency of distributions of NPs to RES was reported [41,46]. This discrepancy would be raised from two factors. One was the fenestra diameter of the mouse liver, which ranged up to 150 nm [47]. In the present study, our prepared NPs were smaller than this fenestra opening; thus, they would be passed through them and avoid RES recognition. The other is the formation of a protein corona, which interacts with the surface of the NPs [7,44]. Once the protein corona is formed, the RES recognized NPs [48]. Most reports were not distinguished from the interaction between D h and surface properties; thus, in our delivery systems, NP Sparse-Small could form a protein corona due to their hydrophobic surface properties, leading to an increase in distribution to the liver and spleen where RES existed. Detailed investigations such as the preparation of NP Dense-Small and NP Sparse-Large using newly synthesized PLA-PEG unimers are required.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells are thought to be the biggest sink for Ad5 in the liver, depletion of them by predosing surprisingly does not reduce the number of vector genomes in the liver [120,127]. Combined predosing and warfarin improve oncolytic killing of distant tumors after i.v. injection, but these two detargeting strategies nevertheless do not significantly decrease viral genomes in the liver or increase viral genomes in the tumor at short time points [120]. In contrast, when Koski et al. treated mice with warfarin to deplete vitamin K dependent blood factor interactions, anti-platelet antibodies, and Kupffer cell scavenger receptor blockers into mice prior to Ad injection, the combination of these treatments yielded an 81% increase in tumor to liver ratio of virus [128]. \n\nThese data suggest that virus may be sequestered by other cells of the liver. To address this, Shayakhmetov's group tested Kupffer and hepatocyte detargeting strategies combined with integrin detargeting by ablation of the RGD motif in Ad5 [68]. They showed that no single intervention by itself fully detargeted the virus from the liver. Rather, only when all three interventions were applied were significant reductions in viral sequestration observed. In particular, ablation of integrin binding appeared to detarget LSECs and hepatocytes, emphasizing the roles of both Kupffer cells and LSECs in viral trapping. Therefore, detargeting all three cell types (and maybe more) appears important to liberate virus for systemic delivery. \n\nSince PEG and HPMA polymers tend to reduce proteinprotein interactions, it is not surprising that coating Ads with these hydrophilic polymers also has effects on interactions with endothelial cells. For example, coating Ad5 with 5 kDa PEG reduces infection and activation of human endothelial cells in vitro [67]. In vivo, PEGylation of Ad5 also reduces interactions with liver LSECs as evidenced by reduced upregulation of E-selectin messenger RNA [67].",

            "text": "For specification of the longitudinal systemic in vivo biodistribution of liposomal formulations in healthy mice, we continued with ex vivo examination of single organs. Representative qualitative images are presented in the supplements (Figures S5-S8). For quantitative purposes, TREs of single organs were normalized to the respective liver value of each mouse, since the highest TREs were detected in livers for all liposomal formulations. \n\nBetween female (Figure 4) and male (Figure S9) mice, no consistent differences of the individual organ liposome pharmacokinetic profiles were observed. All relevant organs were probed, in most of which no DiR signal was detectable. Therefore, we presented only a selection in Figure 4 and Figure S9; an overview about all organs can be found in Figures S10 and S11, for female and male mice, respectively. Over all endpoints, conventional liposomes showed accumulation predominantly in liver and to some extent in spleen (Figure 4), while PEGylated formulations accumulated in the liver and moderately in spleen. In some cases, slight fluorescence signals were also recorded in the uterus and ovaries. The accumulation of nanocarriers in the ovaries has been observed before for polymer [1,49] and lipid nanocarriers [50]. In blood samples, practically no DiR signal was detected at t = 1 h, except for S100 PEG liposomes, where some fluorescense intensities were found. This indicates a clearance from the blood circulation within the first hour post injection. \n\nImpressively, S100 PEG liposomes were systemically distributed, at moderate to high relative TREs in several organs (blood, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys and uteri/ovaries) at all endpoints. \n\nIn summary, conventional liposomes were rapidly eliminated from the whole circulation of the mouse body, showing only residual fluorescence intensities in liver, spleen and to some extent in the ovaries/uterus. PEGylation led to a differential elimination dynamic involving both liver and spleen, whereas differences between PL endure. S100 PEG had a long circulation duration and distribution through most organs over at least 48 h post injection.",

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile.",

            "text": "Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105 These results demonstrated that the protein corona compositions of LNPs are not only associated with surface charges but also related to the chemical structures of ionizable lipids. However, a deep understanding of how the structure of ionizable lipids affects protein corona formation remains challenging, which will greatly help design efficient targeted mRNA delivery vectors. From another perspective, the participation of targeting ligands may endow the targeting ability with delivery systems and already have been applied in vivo, 107,108 which will be detailly discussed in the following section. \n\nAnother challenge for the efficient delivery vector is to control mRNA release. 109 It should be noted that uptake is not always associated with transfection levels. Different chemical groups endow ionizable lipids with different properties, which may determine the mRNA-transfected tissue. For example, Fenton et al. 110 synthesized two structurally similar ionizable lipids OF-02 109 and OF-Deg-Lin, 108 with a slight difference in their hydrophobic tails. OF-02 with nondegradable tails and OF-Deg-Lin containing degradable ester linkages were formulated into LNPs and showed good mRNA transfection efficiency in vivo. Interestingly, following systemic administration, OF-02 and OF-Deg-Lin LNPs mostly accumulated in the livers. However, degradable OF-Deg-Lin LNPs induced protein expression predominantly in the spleen, and nondegradable OF-02 LNPs induced protein expression predominantly in the liver. This phenomenon could be attributed to the degradable property of OF-Deg-Lin. The degradable ester linkages are stable at physiological pH (\u223c7.4) but enzymatically hydrolyzed within tissues and cells. It is worth to be noticed that compared with the liver, the spleen contains a relatively low abundance of hydrolases. 111 Thus, the LNPs are still transported to the liver but may be easily degraded before actively inducing protein expression.",

            "text": "The internal structure of CL-NA NPs again depends on the lipid composition: the formation of lamellar structures has been observed with SAXS and cryo-EM [126,178], as has the absence of periodic ordering (which makes structure determination with SAXS difficult) [126], in particular for LNP formulations that contain cationic lipids with a propensity for forming nonbilayer H II phases [185] and large amounts of cholesterol [183,186]. \n\nTo avoid opsonization and nonspecific attachment to cells (essential for targeted in vivo applications) the surface of CL-NA NPs requires a PEG-lipid concentration that is high enough to ensure that the PEG chains are in the brush regime (i.e., stretched-out chains; e.g., 10 mol% PEG2000-lipid) [170,[173][174][175]187]. Unfortunately, this extent of PEGylation strongly reduces the transfection efficiency of the CL-DNA NPs by increasing the barriers for both cell attachment and endosomal escape [179,180,184]. It is therefore important to devise strategies that can counter these undesirable effects of PEGylation. \n\nBelow, we describe two complementary strategies that can be used for partial recovery of the TE of PEGylated CL-DNA NPs (Figure 13): (1) low pH-induced dePEGylation to promote endolysosomal escape (Figure 14) [179,188,189] and (2) conjugating affinity targeting ligands to the PEG to favor uptake in target cells (Figure 15) [180]. (c) PEGylation reduces cellular uptake of NPs, reducing efficacy. Functionalization of the distal end of a PEG-lipid with an appropriate ligand induces receptor-mediated binding and increases cellular uptake (and thus efficacy) in cells expressing the peptide's receptor [180].",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

However, both R1antTNF and wild-type TNF (wtTNF) have short half-lives (about 10 min) in the plasma of mice. A method of extending the halflife of R1antTNF in the plasma is therefore needed.\n\nConjugation of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to bioactive proteins dramatically improves protein stability in vivo 65)-67) (Fig. 5). Bioconjugation of PEG to bioactive proteinsa process known as PEGylationincreases the molecular weight of the protein and decreases the rate of renal clearance. Additionally, because watersoluble polymers cover the protein surface, attack by proteases is generally blocked through steric hindrance, resulting in prolongation of the half-life in vivo. Moreover, steric hindrance decreases antigenicity and immunogenicity. Because of these advantages, it is possible to use the bioactive protein at a lower dose. Some bioactive proteins such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferonalpha, asparaginase, and adenosine deaminase have been successfully PEGylated, and this process gives them greater therapeutic efficacy than their corresponding native forms. 68)-72) These findings suggest that PEGylation will become an important technique for expanding the clinical application of therapeutic proteins. However, in reality, the successful application of PEGylation is limited, because the polymers react with or mask the active site of the bioactive protein. PEGylation generally targets not only the Nterminal ,-amino group but also the C-amino group of lysine residues, which are often important for the formation of multi-dimensional structures and in the binding between ligands and receptors.

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

            "text": "This study demonstrated the trade-off between PEG grafting density for minimized nonspecific protein adsorption and cancer cell uptake of inorganic NPs. Lower PEG grafting densities and shorter chain lengths have higher cancer cell uptake due to a greater probability of nonspecific protein adsorption. However, this also means that immune system markers such as the opsonin protein also have a higher chance of binding with such NPs, promoting clearance from the body. Based on results, a PEG chain length of 2kDa grafted at 1 PEG/nm 2 repels protein adsorption sufficiently without reducing uptake as much as 5kDa PEG does. In addition, minimized nonspecific protein adsorption by 5kDa may be found problematic when dealing with body clearance of NPs. Results from this study show that the nonspecific protein adsorption properties of such conjugates require a time point study. Such will establish the time it takes for longer PEG chain lengths to adsorb the same amount of protein as shorter PEG chain lengths. This may then be associated with in vivo residency time of PEGylated NPs. In the event that such uptake is inadequate in enhancing cancer treatment outcomes, the use of cancer cell targeting ligands may be used. The integration of targeting ligands will provide NPs with both longer residency times and enhanced internalization by cells. Such properties will promote the clinical use of prospective inorganic NP platforms.",

            "text": "PEG-lipids reduce aggregation of the LNPs and prolong the circulation time of the particles once administered. The molar ratio at which the lipid components are mixed is not uniform across mRNA therapeutic products and may impact the biological activity of the drug product. Roces et al. demonstrated that altering the lipid molar ratios impacts both size and zeta potential of the LNPs [200]. These characteristics of the LNP impact the biodistribution and immunogenicity of the drug product and should therefore be optimized according to the application. Studies evaluating lipid-based systems administered through subcutaneous and intramuscular injection have shown clear effects of the size on their uptake [201,202]. \n\nA study originating from Moderna demonstrated that LNP sizes between 60 and 150 nm were found to produce strong immune responses in non-human primates [201]. Thus, immunotherapeutic mRNA LNP products are likely to be produced within this range [201]. \n\nAs previously established, administration of LNPs through intravenous and intramuscular methods leads to non-specific accumulation of the particles in the liver [203]. Consequently, this accumulation may lead to side effects of the vaccine including hepatic inflammation and hepatic necrosis [204], and could limit access for patients with preexisting inflammatory conditions [205]. The ability to redirect mRNA LNP therapeutics to their target tissue is therefore critical in order to reduce off-target effects [206]. Further work to improve the distribution of LNPs to target-specific tissues is ongoing [207]. Most prominently, selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, developed by Cheng et al., demonstrated that supplementing currently established LNP compositions with specified percentages of charged molecules can alter tissue tropism [208]. Furthermore, the spleen has been shown to be effectively targeted through the use of mRNA coated lipoplexes by adjusting the charge ratio (lipid to RNA) to 1.3:2 [209]. Coating strategies for mRNA LNPs have also been explored [210], including new avenues being PEG coatings for redirection of other nanoparticles from the liver to the target tissue [211,212].",

            "text": "We utilized fluorescent, carboxylated polystyrene NPs as model drug carriers for straightforward surface modification, high-throughput analysis of overall organ distribution by whole-organ imaging, and spatial interrogation in kidney tissue by confocal microscopy. Serum proteins can absorb to the surface of NPs, increasing their recognition and removal by cells of the reticuloendothelial system by opsonization (Chen et al., 2017;Karmali & Simberg, 2011;Leroux, de Jaeghere, Anner, Doelker, & Gurny, 1995). A widespread strategy to mitigate nonspecific uptake by immune cells is to modify NPs with a dense layer of PEG (Suk, Xu, Kim, Hanes, & Ensign, 2016;Yang et al., 2014). In addition, we and others have shown that greater anionic charge on polymers enhances their accumulation in proximal tubule cells of the kidneys (Borgman et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2019;Kamada et al., 2003;Liu et al., 2018). Therefore, in this study we modified carboxylated fluorescent NPs with anionic, carboxymethyl-terminated PEG (PEGylation) via EDC/sulfo-NHS chemistry to improve in vivo pharmacokinetics and leverage anionic charge as a facile targeting method to evaluate kidney accumulation (Figure 1). We did not evaluate cationic materials because they have been described elsewhere (Williams et al., 2015;Zuckerman et al., 2012) and due to concerns of cytotoxicity and inducing nephrotic syndrome (Batsford, Sasaki, Takamiya, & Vogt, 1983;Frohlich, 2012), which may hamper their applicability.\n\nBecause PEGylation modulates NP size and \u03b6-potential (the potential at the hydrodynamic shear boundary), the reaction was initially assessed using dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic mobility. PEGylated NPs (-PEG) exhibited a greater size and more-neutral \u03b6-potential compared to bare (-COOH) NPs (Table 1). This significant change in \u03b6-potential despite reaction with a carboxyme",

            "text": "In contrast, the efficiency of LNPs larger than 100 nm for delivery to the lymph nodes was significantly reduced. \n\nThey further suggested that PEGylation could prolong the circulation time of LNPs in vivo, increase their chances of being taken up by the lymphatic system, and promote the ability of LNPs larger than 100 nm to deliver to the lymph nodes [222]. Larger-sized LNPs (> 500 nm) could be taken up by DCs at the injection site, with the antigen delivered to T cells in the lymph nodes via the lymphatic route, which was typically slower and took longer than 24 h, so the LNPs could remain at the injection site [223]. mRNA delivery to DCs can also be enhanced without targeting ligands through optimization of ionizable lipids. Long et al. [208] developed a novel ionizable lipid YK009-LNP, whose ionizable part contains a tertiary amine headgroup, hydroxyl-modified at the end, with different ester bond positions and two different lengths of branched saturated tails, in the absence of targeting ligands. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that YK009-LNP-Omicron mRNA was internalized by DCs via CME and CvME, and mainly accumulated in the injection site and spleen of mice after intramuscular injection, inducing effective humoral and cellular immune responses (Fig. 14A). Furthermore, Ni et al. [209] found that piperazine-containing ionizable lipids (Pi-Lipids) could deliver mRNA to APCs, such as splenic macrophages, splenic DCs, and hepatic DCs, via intravenous injection. Chen et al. [49] designed a non-targeted LNP system 113-O12B that mainly delivered OVA mRNA to APCs in the lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, inducing a robust antibody and CD8 + T cell response in a B16F10 melanoma mouse model and significantly inhibited the growth of OVA tumors in mice.",

In addition to the effect that the protein corona can have on LNP tropism, LNP size can also contribute to passive tissue targeting.\n\nIn one example, nanoparticle size influenced the potency of siRNA-based LNPs in vivo 182 . In another example, nanoparticle size governed the frequency with which an LNP was cleared by immune cells in the lymph node 183 .\n\nSimilarly, several groups have demonstrated that LNP charge can affect delivery. In one example, scientists developed a lipoplex that delivered mRNA to the spleen by altering its charge 142 . Similar systems have delivered therapeutic mRNA in different animal models 66,184 . Likewise, by adding a cationic lipid to the LNP, scientists retargeted an LNP with liver tropism to the lung 125 . These splenic and pulmonary delivery datasets were subsequently observed using LNPs that facilitated mRNA delivery and Cas9-mediated gene editing 101 .\n\nActive targeting. RNA can also be ferried into on-target cells using 'active targeting' . In this strategy, a ligand that binds a specific biomolecule is added to the delivery system ( Fig. 4b-d). The most clinically validated examples are GalNAc-siRNA and GalNAc-ASO conjugates, which have led to the FDA-approved drugs givosiran 16 and lumasiran 18 , as well as the EMA-approved drug inclisiran 17 . GalNAc is a carbohydrate-derived trivalent ligand that binds the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) (Fig. 4b). ASGPR is an ideal receptor for active targeting: it is highly expressed on target cells (in this case hepatocytes), not expressed on other cell types, leads to rapid endocytosis upon GalNAc binding, and is rapidly recycled to the cell surface following endocytosis. GalNAc also exhibits several traits that make it an ideal targeting ligand. First, it has a molecular weight of <2 kDa, which is many times less than the molecular weight of the ASO or siR",

This adsorption was competitively inhibited by treatment with heparin or heparinases, suggesting that involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), 51,52) which are abundantly expressed on the surface of hepatocytes and are known to be a receptor of the ApoE protein. 53) These findings that liver accumulation is a complex process in which the bare LNPs rapidly adsorb to the microvillar surface of hepatocytes through ApoE-HSPG interactions following the binding of ApoE proteins to the LNPs in the blood circulation after intravenous administration (Fig. 3B). \n\nThe YSK05-LNPs showed ED 50 values of 0.06 mg siRNA/kg and a durable gene silencing for up to 2 weeks in a mouse FVII model through optimizing the lipid composition. 54) To apply this to the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), mice with chronic HCV infections were produced by the inoculation of the HCV genotype 1b in chimeric mice with humanized liver cells and the siHCV-loaded YSK05-LNPs were then intravenously administered. HCV genomic RNA levels in serum were suppressed up to 90% for periods of up to 2 weeks (Fig. 3C).

            "text": "Functional nucleic acids, such as siRNA, sgRNA and mRNA, were co-formulated into LNPs with a unique DNA barcode. They measured the functional Cre mRNA delivery of more than 250 LNPs to multiple cell types in vivo, and identified two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA to endothelial cells and mediate endothelial cell gene editing [195]. Combined with bioinformatics, the team performed in vivo directed evolution of RNA delivery, and identified one LNPs that effectively delivers siRNA and sgRNA to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) in vivo [194]. Meanwhile, in vivo screening can help to reveal the relations between nanoparticle structures and activities. The tropism of BMEC was not related to the particle size, yet changed with PEG structure and the introduction of cholesterol. For example, the group found a targeting ligand-free LNP containing oxidized cholesterol delivered Cre mRNA into the liver microenvironment 5-fold more than to hepatocytes, suggesting that cholesterol chemical composition played an important role in LNP targeting [196]. By applying a siGFP/DNA-barcoded system in transgenic eGFP mice, the group found that constrained lipid nanoparticles (cLNPs) containing a conformationally constrained adamantane tail can deliver siRNA and sgRNA to splenic T cells in vivo at low doses [197], and in contrast to standard LNPs do not preferentially target hepatocytes. Based on this, the group further demonstrated cLNP containing adamantyl phospholipids can delivery Cre mRNA to liver immune cells at low doses [198]. Like reported before [188], delivery takes place in a size-independent and chemical composition-dependent manner, providing a potential alternative for further active targeting based on chemical modification and not targeting ligands. \n\nBy screening hundreds of nanoparticles simultaneously, the high throughput DNA barcodebased system helps the researcher to understand the delivery process of nanocarriers, elucidate chemical composition-activity relations and identify optimized nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing.",

It was reported that PEGylated nanoparticles show higher tumor accumulation versus background. \n\nBoth GNPs and GAL-PEG-GNPs at various concentrations showed cytotoxicity, and their IC 50 values are 5.001 and 4.997 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Compared to the published data of GNPs cytotoxicity [35], our GNPs are ICP-MS analysis revealed that the amount of GAL-PEG-GNPs endocytosed by HepG2 cells was approximately three times more than that of GNPs dose, suggesting GAL significantly increased the gold uptake. Although both internalizing and noninternalizing epitopes on cell membrane can be targeted, if ligands bind to noninternalizing ones, drugs or nanoparticles may accumulate around the cells and enter into cells either by passive diffusion or normal transport mechanisms. In contrast, when GAL bind to internalizing epitopes, like ASGPR, the binding triggers ASGPRmediated uptake and hence GAL-PEG-GNPs uptake is thus more effective. TEM images showed that GNPs were mainly distributed in mitochondrion. Few reports have demonstrated a role for reactive oxygen free radicals (ROS) or the involvement of mitochondria as mechanism of GNPs radiosensitization [36,37]. In this study, we confirmed that elevated levels of DNA damage which may be a direct result of impaired mitochondrial function manifested by increased oxidation and loss of membrane potential, resulting in HepG2 cells proliferation inhibition. It was further confirmed by clonogenic analysis. After exposure of cells to various radiation doses (1-8 Gy zone), clone quantities in GAL-PEG-GNPs-treated group were significantly less than that in GNPs-treated and control groups mainly due to more amount of gold uptake. \n\nThe cell cycle analysis showed that cells were propelled to enter G2/M phase.",

            "text": "In addition, PGs, being a major component of the ECM in the alveolar wall [60], are prevalent on the surface of lung capillary endothelium [61]. Nevertheless, the enhanced uptake in the lungs could be, at least in part, due to the abundant interstitial monocytes in this organ [62][63][64]. This is corroborated by the finding (Figure S4) that targeted NPs are engulfed to a higher extent than non-targeted NPs by white blood cells (WBCs), specifically by monocytes. This in turn is most likely because of the different PEGylation type of the NPs. PEG in non-targeted NPs (PLGA-PEG) is expected to be entirely functional in structure in comparison to that in targeted NPs since the PEG moiety is blocked at the end by the peptide (PLGA-PEG-ApoB-P). Taken together, the enhanced accumulation in the lungs of targeted NPs represents a significant potential for lung metastases therapy. \n\nThe major MPS organs responsible for particulate system sequestration and disposal are the liver and the spleen [21,65,66]. Indeed, in both mammary carcinoma models, substantial amounts of both targeted and non-targeted NPs were observed in these clearing organs, and similar levels were observed after 24 h (Figures 4 and 5a,b). Similarly, no difference in the disposition of targeted and non-targeted NPs was observed in kidneys, which exhibited the lowest level of biodistribution, probably because the size of the NPs was too large for renal filtration [65]. \n\nFinally, a significantly higher amount of the targeted vs. non-targeted NPs (1.4 times) was detected in the primary tumor site (Figure 5c,d). Of note, both targeted and non-targeted NPs were distributed throughout the tumor tissue, located in between the tumor cells (ECM) and inside the cells (Figure 5e). We anticipate that after reducing the uptake of targeted NPs by WBCs, higher levels in the tumor would be obtained.",

The serum levels of BSA-FITC and NPs loaded with the former showed a rapid decrease with time, manifesting single exponential decay curves (Fig 6). These results demonstrated that PEP52 NPs circulated in the blood longer than PLA NPs, EP02 NPs, or BSA-FITC alone. Comparison of the AUCs between PEP NPs and BSA-FITC showed that the fluorescence levels of PEG-modified NPs were found to be significantly higher than those of the control and those obtained after PLA and EP02 NP treatments (P< 0.05).

In comparison with non-modified NPs, an increase in the area under the curve (AUC, from 0 to 12 h) in plasma and in tumors by 245% and 194%, respectively, and a reduction in the AUC (from 0 to 12 h) in the liver by 13% by targeted stealth NPs was reported [147]. Likewise, using a similar FA-ICG-PLGA nanosystem, it was shown that NPs injected subcutaneously into mice with MCF-7 tumors exhibited much greater circulation times than free ICG and specifically targeted tumors [148]. Furthermore, PEG-PLGA NP surfaces modified by FA and K237 (a polypeptide that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) and radiolabeled with 99m Tc, a radionuclide nuclear agent, were found to accumulate in tumors, the liver, kidney, spleen, and blood at 3 and 9 h after intravenous administration in mice xenografted with ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3 cells) [149].",

            "text": "As for the tissue distribution, this was assessed 6 h postadministration for PEG-DMG-LNPs and 24 h post-administration for PEG-DSG-LNPs. Whole-organ fluorescence spectroscopy was measured for Cy5.5 and Cy7, right after organ collection (Fig. S4). Fluorescence spectroscopy of tissue lysates from PEG-DMG-LNP-treated animals revealed no statistically significant differences in tumor accumulation but showed a possible trend towards more tumor accumulation when animals were pre-treated with liposomes for both Cy5.5 (control 3.17 % vs liposomes 5.92 %) (Fig. 3f) and Cy7 (control 3.61 % vs liposomes 7.04 %) (Fig. 3g). Regarding PEG-DSG-LNPs, there were again no statistically significant differences regarding tumor accumulation for both Cy5.5 (Fig. 3h) and Cy7 analysis (Fig. 3i). Following our main biodistribution readout (siAR-Cy5.5) for PEG-DMG and PEG-DSG LNPs, the control and liposome groups showed a very similar biodistribution pattern, where most of the signal was detected in the liver and spleen (Fig. 3f,h). \n\nRegarding the Cy7-lipid readouts, most of the signal from PEG-DMG LNP tissue lysates came from the liver and the biodistribution profiles of the control and the liposome groups were very similar (Fig. 3g). In the case of PEG-DSG LNP treated animals, the Cy7 signals from tissue lysates at 24 h showed a broad distribution across the tested organs with particularly high kidney signal, potentially indicating LNP processing by that time and Cy7-lipid label accumulation in the kidney due to its small size (<1.5 kDa) (Fig. 3i). \n\nPriming the animals with liposomes reduced blood circulation of PEG-DMG-and PEG-DSG siRNA-LNPs and did not significantly enhance their tumor accumulation.",

            "text": "An in vivo biodistribution study was conducted to better assess the differential uptake of the various GNP formulations by in situ tumor cells and macrophages functioning within an active immune system. A murine model of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in BALB/c female mice was used. When the tumors reached ~300 mm 3 , the mice were randomly divided into eight groups and injected via intraperitoneal injection with the GNPs. We excluded the PEGylated particles with PEG 2 and 5 kDa since they showed the lowest uptake by cancer cells in in vitro studies. The mice were euthanized after 24 and 72 h post-injection, and the tumors, livers, and spleens were collected for ICP-MS analysis. Results showed that the uptake of most of the PEGylated and non-PEGylated GNPs by the liver and spleen is significantly higher than their uptake by tumor cells, Figures 7 and 8. The 4 nm PEGylated GNPs/AS1411 exhibited the highest uptake by tumor cells at 72 h, but the difference is non-significant among the means. The 4 nm non-PEGylated GNPs/CRO showed the highest uptake by tumor cells at 24 h and the difference is non-significant among the means as well. The uptake of all types of the 4 nm GNPs by the liver and spleen did not show any significance among their means. \n\nThe uptake of the 10 nm PEGylated GNPs/AS1411 by tumor cells was significantly higher than the other particles at 24 h (p = 0.0162). 10 nm PEGylated GNPs/CRO displayed a slight increase compared with the non-PEGylated ones although the difference is nonsignificant. The results of the in vivo study revealed that PEGylation increases the uptake by tumor cells (especially 10 nm GNPs) for particles with AS1411, and in general, we observed that the uptake of large particles (10 nm) by the liver and the spleen is higher than the uptake of small ones (4 nm).",

            "text": "Currently, nucleic acids-based therapies are of immense clinical value due to their vast potential. LNPs have made significant progress in the field of targeted delivery of nucleic acids, but they also face certain challenges. Therefore, reasonable design of LNPs in the future will help overcome these difficulties. \n\n(1) Although LNP therapies generally exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to conventional chemotherapy and protein therapy, they are not immune to potential toxicity arising from the accumulation of LNPs in the liver and spleen. The presence of PEG chains in LNPs is beneficial in reducing toxic side effects and increasing their circulation time in vivo. Keeping a reasonable balance between the proportion of PEGylated lipids and PEG chain length in LNPs may mitigate their toxicity. (2) Traditional LNPs possess inherent passive targeting properties that predominantly guide them to hepatocytes, leading to accumulation in the liver and spleen. There is an urgent need to develop LNPs tailored to deliver nucleic acids to other organs. Screening and optimizing selective ILs or implementing chemical and biological modifications will enhance the targeting of specific organs. In addition, by exploring structure-activity relationships and chemical synthesis, more ILs for extrahepatic and extrasplenic targeting could be obtained. (3) The relationship between LNPs components and the types of protein corona formed on their surface needs to be further studied. Constructing and screening a predictable library is essential, validating the structure-activity relationship of lipids, and proteomics is anticipated to provide insights for the design of organ-selective LNPs. (4) The organ-selective delivery of LNPs faces the common challenge of being time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emerging use of DNA or mRNA barcodes holds the potential to enable high-throughput in vivo screening to address this issue. (5) The current pharmacokinetic studies of LNPs are not without flaws, and the use of LNPs may induce immune responses, which can limit their long-term usage. Continuous drug safety assessment and optimization are necessary to ensure the reliability and safety of LNPs in clinical applications.",

In addition, a combination of the responses of both tumor markers predicted the pattern of disease progression, extrahepatic versus intrahepatic. Extrahepatic disease occurred more frequently in the A\u2193P\u2191 group and intrahepatic disease more frequently in the A\u2191P\u2193 group (50.0% versus 28.6% for extrahepatic disease; 50.0 versus 71.4% for intrahepatic disease, respectively;  = 0.001).

The mRNA delivery using VcLipid was ~70-and ~300-folds more efficient in comparison to Lipofectamine 3000 and electroporation, respectively. The schematic design of LNP is presented in Figure 4.  Wang et al. used NP3.47, as an inhibitor of the Niemann-Pick type C-1 protein (NPC-1), to conjugate the LNPs surface. The accumulation of siRNA with NP3.47 decorated LMPs (vs. unmodified LNP) was ~3-folds higher in late endosomes/lysosomes, indicating improved siRNA delivery [76]. The modified LNPs resulted in the efficient delivery of siRNA-EpCAM when targeted against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) Epi-1, positive cells in vitro and also minimized the progression of tumour in mice [77]. PEGylation can also serve for the functionalization of LNP bioconjugation with biomolecules or ligands. For example, Chen et al. reported that GalNAc conjugated with LNP-siRNA-PEG formulation, a single dose of administration displayed a significant gene silencing effect on hepatocytes Factor VII (FVII). These findings could be useful for treating hepatocellular carcinoma [78]. Similarly, Singh et al. used hyaluronan-conjugated DSPE-PEG-amine using carbodiimide chemistry for tumour targeting [79], and Parhiz et al. used DSPE-PEGmaleimide for conjugating antibodies using thioester linkages [80]. \n\nBeyond the usual components of LNPs (ILs, cholesterol, amphipathic phospholipids, and PEG-lipids), the addition of supplemental components (known as a SORT molecule) could also alter the in vivo delivery of cargo thereby helps in the improvement of tissuespecific delivery.",

Among the hepatic receptors for apoE, the most widely studied is the LDLR. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies were conducted to examine differences in uptake of LNPs in primary hepatocytes from both wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Relative to wild-type primary hepatocytes, the level of uptake for iLNPs was diminished in LDLR \u2212/\u2212 primary hepatocytes, and a substantial fraction of labeled iLNPs was found to concentrate on the plasma membrane of the LDLR \u2212/\u2212 cells, suggesting that internalization of the iLNPs was significantly inhibited (Figure 3a). Next, the dependence of iLNPs on the LDLR in vivo was studied by comparing silencing activity in both wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Animals received either saline or factor VII siRNA formulated in iLNPs at 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg. Consistent with in vitro results demonstrating impaired uptake in LDLR \u2212/\u2212 hepatocytes, in vivo silencing activity of the iLNP was greatly diminished in the LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3b).\n\nAn exogenous targeting ligand, GalnAc, can also rescue activity in apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice As exogenous apoE addition was able to rescue activity of the iLNP in apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, we hypothesized that the specific incorporation of other hepatocyte-targeting ligands into the iLNP formulation could serve a similar role. Hence, a trivalent GalNAc ligand was designed, synthesized, and incorporated into the iLNP formulation as a PEG-lipid (Figure 4a). The GalNAc moiety was conjugated to the distal end of a 2,000 MW polyethylene glycol (PEG) utilizing a distearyl (C18) lipid (GalNAc-PEG-DSG) providing a stable hydrophobic anchor for the targeted PEG-lipid to the iLNP.

Fluorescent microscopic observations of intrahepatic siRNA distribution revealed that most of the siRNAs showed a punctate pattern in the case of the 3%PEG-LNPs, indicating failure of endosomal escape, while substantial amounts of siRNAs showed a diffused pattern in the case of 1%PEG-LNPs, indicating the successful cytosolic delivery of siRNAs. The quantification of siRNAs also permitted the amount of siRNAs delivered by 3%PEG-LNPs to be measured and the findings indicated that the amount was significantly lower than that delivered by 1%PEG-LNPs, suggesting the premature release of siRNAs from the 3%PEG-LNPs in the blood stream. An in vitro study confirmed that the siRNAs released from the 3%PEG-LNPs showed a lower gene silencing activity only in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) but not in the absence of FBS (Fig. 9B), suggesting that serum components promote the destabilization and inactivation of small-sized LNPs. Measurement of the relative surface area using a TNS probe revealed that the actual relative surface area of 3%PEG-LNPs was 2.99-fold higher than that of the 1%PEG-LNPs (Fig. 9C), which was significantly higher than the theoretically calculated relative surface area (1.72-fold) (Fig. 9D), indicating that lower lipid packing on the interface may have occurred, possible due to packing stress derived from strain between the actual positive curvature on the interface of the LNPs and the spontaneous negative curvature of the fusogenic CLs (Fig. 9E). Measurement of the hydration level of the interface of the LNPs using laurdan supported the above finding (Fig. 9F).",

            "text": "Active targeting involves decoration of the LNP surface with ligands that specifically interact with highly expressed receptors on target cells. Several types of ligands, such as antibodies, peptides, aptamers, polysaccharides (or glycans) and small molecules, may be used to improve binding affinities and facilitate the cellular uptake of LNPs for cancer therapy [199]. An efficient ligand-receptor interaction depends mainly on the ligand binding affinity and density on the surface of LNPs. Full-length antibodies containing Fc domains are frequently used for targeting, as these ligands show specific binding and therapeutic capabilities. The Fc domain of an antibody enables triggering of Fc-mediated effector functions, and it binds with the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn to prolong its half-life in circulation [207,208]. However, antibodies are macromolecules, and their large size limits the density that may be conjugated on the surface of LNPs; the large size may also interfere with diffusion into the tumor interstitium, thereby reducing the therapeutic efficacy [209]. To overcome these limitations of large targeting molecules, many studies have been conducted on antibody fragments lacking the Fc region, such as antigen-binding fragments (Fab) and single-chain variable fragments (scFv). These fragments have smaller molecular weights but retain high affinity to target cells and exhibit high penetration efficiency [210]. Although scFv and Fab fragments have both been applied in LNPs constructs [211,212], scFvs are thermally instable, which introduces difficulties in manufacturing [213]. Fabs are more thermally stable, so these fragments can provide both the stability and affinity essential for high neutralizing capacity [211]. The addition of PEG moieties (PEGylation) and serum albumin can be used to enhance the half-life of an LNP with conjugated antibody fragments [210]. Aside from antibodies, targeting peptides can be identified from in vivo biopanning of a M13 bacteriophage-display peptide library [191]. The utility of peptide-conjugated LNPs was demonstrated in a study showing successful delivery of mRNA to the retina in a potential treatment for inherited blindness [214].",

            "text": "An ideal LNP system must meet multiple requirements such as particle size in the order of 80 nm, sufficient stability and penetration through the liver fenestrae, and lack of inflammatory reactions, immunogenicity, and cytotoxic effects in a host. Other biological barriers include protection by nucleases, evading the MPS, and renal glomerular filtration for effective systemic distribution. The surface engineering of LNPs offers stability and target efficiency, which in turn improves the efficacy of loaded therapeutics, i.e., siRNA. The apparent pKa value of IL in the range of ~6.4 with a neutral surface charge is desirable to avoid sequestration by MPS. Thorough investigations of the ideal (or desirable) LNP structure(s), however, remain to be fully explored in different indications. It is possible that certain LNP configurations might be more advantageous for certain indications (e.g., provide better delivery at the disease site), but this issue remains to be investigated in a systematic way. The urgency to push for clinical use sometimes de-emphasizes such explorations, limiting clinically useful LNP formulations to a handful of formulations. With an increasing understanding of the contributing properties of the LNP components, further modification of the components could be employed in order to achieve a stable formulation and effective targeting of desired organs. The better implementation of organ-specific targeting is bound to enhance the efficacy of treatment as well as reduce any possible side effects by restricting the biodistribution of the drug and carrier to the site of action. This endeavour will be especially important to expand the utility of siRNAs beyond liver diseases (all siRNA approved to date are for liver indications). \n\nFor further improvements in bioavailability, increased circulation in the blood, delivery to the target organs, the surface modification of LNPs such as PEGylation, and incorporation of surface ligands on the LNPs have been found to be effective strategies. Engineered approaches to 'shed' the incorporated targeting/functional moieties will be beneficial to enhance the therapeutic effects once the carrier reaches its destination. Improved delivery in the order of 2-to 3-folds will not possibly be beneficial for improved clinical outcomes, but a more significant improvement such as 10-fold increased delivery might be required for significant clinical effects.",

The PEGylated lipids (PEG 2000 -C-DMG) are conjugated with short anchors to the NP lipid membrane, which allows for their redistribution from the NP surface in the surrounding environment and exposure of the ionizable lipids at the surface of the LNPs. After dissociation of the PEGylated lipids, the naked surface of the particles containing the ionizable DLin-KC2-DMA, which is neutral in a biological environment, interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), enabling ApoE liver-mediated targeting. Transient PEGylation facilitates not only the localization and interaction with the target cell but also improves ion pair formation between the ionizable lipid (which will become cationic at pH 4) and the anionic endogenous endosomal phospholipids. This will enable the fast release of the payload into the cytoplasm and efficacious transfection [142][143][144][145][146][147][148]. Besides the efforts for liver and liver hepatocyte targeting, different research groups are working on the challenge of developing lipid nanoparticles for specific organ targeting after IV administration, including lipid nanoparticles for lung targeting or targeting relevant cell types, that is, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells of the lungs, B cells, and T cells.",

As shown in Figure 4, exponential increase in tumor size was seen in the control group, with the tumor size reaching ~1500 mm 3 . As expected, the P/LNPs-siRNA-MF treated group exhibited favorable tumor suppression compared to the P/LNPs-siRNA-BM treated group (31.64 versus 70.67 mm 3 /day), suggesting that P/LNPs-siRNA-MF was more efficacious. \n\nP/LNPs already have been demonstrated to have gene silencing activity in HepG-2 liver cancer cells during in vitro studies. Here, we performed qRT-PCR and western blot analysis for silencing efficiencies at VEGF mRNA and protein levels in tumors in mice treated with P/LNPs in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro results, P/ LNPs-siRNA-MF facilitated the greatest down regulation in gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels among the three groups. In addition, pathological analysis clearly showed that tumor tissue suffer severe damage after P/ LNPs-siRNA-MF therapy, while no histological changes were detected in normal organ tissues indicating P/LNPs were not toxic. Taken together, it was confirmed that P/ LNPs-siRNA-MF was the most effective approach for VEGF gene silencing as well as tumor suppression in vivo. The superior anti-tumor activity of P/LNPs-siRNA-MF in vivo likely could be attributed to nanoparticle synthesis using MF method. MF provides better mixing between P/LNPs and siRNA, resulting in uniform nanostructure and reduced surface charge of P/LNPs-siRNA-MF.",

            "text": "Unlike hepatic targets, there are no specific proteins, such as apoE, that mediate the targeting pathways for extrahepatic targets. Consequently, several approaches have been employed for nonhepatic targeting. In this context, SORT was investigated by Dillard et al., in which a fifth component (or SORT molecule), in addition to the conventional four-lipid composition of LNPs, facilitates extrahepatic targeting [65]. Di et al. [102] have extensively reviewed methods for the extrahepatic targeting of mRNA delivery, which align with the SORT approach. Their findings indicated that positively charged lipids and negatively charged LNPs preferentially accumulate in the lungs and spleen, respectively. \n\nThe lungs represent a common target for nucleic acid treatment because of their association with numerous diseases and relatively accessible surface. However, they pose unique challenges due to their intricate biological mechanisms, such as mucociliary clearance and alveolar macrophage engulfment, which clear inhaled particles. Xue et al. [103] synthesized 180 cationic degradable (CAD) lipids and screened them using high-throughput DNA barcode technology to identify those that could effectively deliver mRNA to the lungs. Screening results showed that LNP-CAD9 efficiently delivered mRNA to the lungs, providing a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung diseases. Wei et al. [77] optimized and improved the Lung SORT LNP delivery system, aiming to effectively deliver Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and donor single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates to lung basal cells, thereby achieving precise homologous directed repair-mediated gene correction in a cystic fibrosis (CF) model. The optimized Lung SORT LNP system efficiently delivered mRNA to basal lung cells in Ai9 mice. Furthermore, LNPs can bypass pulmonary barriers and reach the lung endothelium through the bloodstream by modifying surface charge or functionalization using peptides, antibodies, or small-molecule ligands [81,104]. Massaro et al. [78] demonstrated the potential of the LNP delivery of mRNA therapeutics to lungs undergoing fibrosis.",

            "text": "In addition to ligand-mediated targeting, different modified ionizable lipids can facilitate delivery of mRNAs to specific cell types or organs. One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.",

They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved...Unexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction...Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose...Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile.",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

This will help establish the fundamental concepts for readers.\n\nFor the main content, I'll divide it into three key dimensions:\n\n1. \"Effects of PEGylation Percentage on LNP Distribution\" - This dimension should be a synthesis paragraph since it requires explaining the relationship between PEGylation levels and LNP behavior in the body. The quotes show that different PEG percentages (1.5%, 3%, 5%) affect ApoE binding and cellular uptake, which influences hepatic vs. extrahepatic distribution.\n\n2. \"Impact of Mannose Targeting on LNP Distribution\" - This should also be a synthesis paragraph as it involves complex interactions between mannose targeting and PEGylation levels. The quotes discuss how mannose incorporation affects delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes, as well as extrahepatic macrophages.\n\n3. \"Other Targeting Ligands for LNP Distribution Control\" - This should be a list format since the quotes mention several potential targeting approaches (small molecules, peptides, antibodies) but don't provide detailed mechanisms for each. A list will effectively organize these different options.\n\nThese dimensions follow a logical progression from basic PEGylation effects to specific targeting strategies, providing a comprehensive answer to the query.",

                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as crucial delivery vehicles for nucleic acid therapeutics, including siRNA, mRNA, and DNA. When administered intravenously, LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver due to their interaction with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which facilitates uptake by hepatocytes through the LDL receptor pathway. This natural hepatotropism makes LNPs excellent candidates for liver-targeted therapies but presents challenges when targeting other tissues is desired. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nPEGylation, the process of attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to the LNP surface, serves as a critical modification strategy. PEG creates a hydrophilic shield around the particle, reducing opsonization (binding of blood proteins) and recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), thus extending circulation time and altering biodistribution. The percentage of PEG-lipids in the LNP formulation significantly impacts these properties and the resulting tissue distribution pattern. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nTargeting ligands represent another approach to modify LNP distribution. By attaching specific molecules like mannose (which binds to mannose receptors on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) or antibodies (which recognize specific cell surface antigens), LNPs can be directed to particular cell types within or outside the liver. This active targeting approach can enhance cellular uptake in desired tissues and reduce off-target effects. The combination of PEGylation and targeting ligands offers precise control over the intrahepatic versus extrahepatic distribution of LNPs. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nThe percentage of PEGylation in LNP formulations plays a critical role in determining their biodistribution profile and cellular targeting efficiency. LNPs with lower PEG-lipid content (approximately 1.5%) have been identified as optimal for standard LNP formulations, influencing both particle size and stability. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This lower PEG content allows for efficient association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), facilitating effective delivery to hepatocytes through the LDL receptor pathway.\n\nKumar and colleagues demonstrated that increasing PEG-lipid content from 1.5% to 5% significantly reduces ApoE binding to LNPs, resulting in decreased hepatocyte uptake and activity. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> This effect creates an opportunity for shifting the distribution pattern of LNPs away from the default hepatocyte targeting. The reduced ApoE association at higher PEG densities (3-5%) effectively blocks the natural hepatotropism of LNPs, creating a \"clean slate\" for alternative targeting strategies.\n\nThe PEG-lipid content also impacts the effectiveness of targeting ligands. For instance, when mannose targeting ligands are incorporated into LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid content, the delivery remains predominantly driven by the ApoE-mediated pathway in the presence of serum, limiting the mannose-specific targeting effect. In contrast, mannose incorporated into LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid shows significantly enhanced mannose-receptor mediated uptake, as the higher PEG content blocks competing ApoE-mediated uptake mechanisms. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nHigher PEGylation percentages provide additional benefits beyond distribution control, including reduced immunostimulatory potential and decreased hemolytic activity, contributing to an improved safety profile. <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> However, the trade-off is that highly PEGylated LNPs without targeting ligands show reduced efficacy for liver delivery due to their diminished ApoE association.\n\nThis limitation can be overcome by incorporating exogenous targeting ligands, such as GalNAc clusters that bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes, effectively circumventing the need for ApoE-mediated targeting. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> This strategy demonstrates how PEGylation percentage and targeting ligands can work synergistically to control LNP distribution: higher PEG content blocks natural liver targeting, while specific ligands redirect the particles to desired cell types.\n\nThe PEGylation percentage must be carefully balanced - too little fails to shield LNPs from non-specific interactions, while too much may overly restrict cellular uptake. A PEG content of around 3% appears to represent a sweet spot for many targeting applications, providing sufficient blocking of ApoE-mediated pathways while allowing targeting ligands to effectively direct LNP distribution. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>",

They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved",

                            "Formulation of short interfering RNA (siRNA) into multicomponent lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is an effective strategy for hepatic delivery and therapeutic gene silencing. This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                "text": "\nMannose targeting represents a strategic approach to redirect LNP distribution within the liver, specifically toward liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) that express mannose receptors (CD206). This targeting strategy leverages the specific expression pattern of mannose receptors on LSECs to achieve selective nucleic acid delivery to these cells rather than hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe effectiveness of mannose targeting is significantly influenced by the PEGylation percentage of the LNP formulation. Kim and colleagues demonstrated that mannose-incorporated LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid content showed similar increases in mRNA expression levels regardless of serum presence. In contrast, mannose-incorporated LNPs with only 1.5% PEG-lipid failed to enhance targeting in the presence of serum. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThis difference in targeting efficiency can be explained by competing uptake mechanisms. At lower PEG densities (1.5%), LNPs can simultaneously be internalized through both ApoE-mediated and mannose-receptor pathways in the presence of serum, effectively diluting the mannose-specific targeting effect. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) reduces ApoE adsorption, allowing LNP uptake to be primarily driven by mannose-CD206 interactions. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe shift in intrahepatic distribution with mannose targeting is substantial. Compared to standard LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed a significant decrease in hepatocyte uptake (measured by tdTomato fluorescence), confirming their redirection away from the default hepatocyte targeting pattern. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond intrahepatic redistribution, mannose-modified LNPs also demonstrate altered extrahepatic distribution. Research has shown enhanced lung accumulation of mannose-modified LNPs at a dose of 1 mg/kg, indicating that mannose targeting can influence both intrahepatic and extrahepatic distribution patterns. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn practical applications, mannose targeting is typically implemented by incorporating mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid component of LNPs. This modification enables LSEC-specific delivery of nucleic acids such as GFP mRNA at the cellular level. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe mannose targeting approach exemplifies how specific ligand modifications can effectively redirect LNP distribution away from the default hepatocyte targeting pattern, providing a means to selectively deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to specific cell populations within and potentially beyond the liver.",

(Kumar et al., 2014) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved",

On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant.

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

These active targeting strategies enable precise distribution control for nucleic acid delivery both within and outside the liver. (1 source)",
                "text": "\nIn addition to mannose targeting, numerous other ligands can be incorporated into LNP formulations to control their biodistribution and enhance cell-specific delivery:\n\n* **GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine)**: Enables selective targeting of hepatocytes through binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). This approach is particularly useful when higher PEGylation percentages are used to block natural ApoE-mediated hepatocyte uptake but hepatocyte delivery is still desired.\n\n* **Antibodies and antibody fragments**: Provide highly specific targeting to cell surface antigens. These can direct LNPs to particular cell populations both within the liver (e.g., Kupffer cells) and in extrahepatic tissues like tumors. Their high specificity makes them valuable for precision targeting applications.\n\n* **Aptamers**: DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that fold into specific three-dimensional structures capable of binding target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Aptamer-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery to cells expressing the target molecules.\n\n* **Peptides**: Short amino acid sequences that can bind to specific receptors. Examples include RGD peptides targeting integrins on tumor cells and CPP (cell-penetrating peptides) that enhance cellular uptake across multiple tissues.\n\n* **Small molecules**: Various small molecule ligands can be conjugated to LNPs to enhance targeted delivery. These include folate (targeting folate receptors overexpressed in many cancers) and transferrin (targeting transferrin receptors).\n\n* **Glycans and other carbohydrates**: Beyond mannose, other sugar moieties can target specific receptors. For example, fucose can target dendritic cells, while sialic acid modifications can alter recognition patterns.\n\n* **Cell membrane-derived vesicles**: Coating LNPs with cell membrane components from target cells can enhance homotypic targeting to those specific cell types.\n\nThese targeted modifications represent widely employed active targeting strategies that can significantly alter the default hepatotropic distribution of LNPs. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> The choice of targeting ligand depends on the desired target tissue, with each offering unique advantages for specific therapeutic applications. When combined with optimized PEGylation percentages, these targeting approaches enable precise control over both intrahepatic and extrahepatic LNP distribution.",
