                    "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.",

                    "text": "In this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a systematic review of adverse events (AEs) occurring in cancer patients treated with commercially available ADCs. We then carried out a meta-analysis on all eligible phase II-III clinical trials. We also evaluated the potential effect of drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and systemic free payload concentration on toxicity in the context of the cleavability of the linkers used.",

Wynn, Tran Le, Martin McCandless, Yunxi Zhang, Ritesh Patel, Nita Maihle, William B. Hillegass\n## Abstract\nWhile in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.\n## Introduction\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.\n...\nIn this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers. We hypothesized that ADCs with cleavable linkers would be associated with greater systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a systematic review of adverse events (AEs) occurring in cancer patients treated with commercially available ADCs. We then carried out a meta-analysis on all eligible phase II-III clinical trials. We also evaluated the potential effect of drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and systemic free payload concentration on toxicity in the context of the cleavability of the linkers used.\n\n## Statistical analysis: meta-analysis of clinical toxicity rates\nTo compare the incidence of toxicities in patients treated with ADCs constructed with cleavable vs non-cleavable linkers, generalized linear mixed effects logistic models were conducted for each toxicity, including: 1. By linker type. Univariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 2. Linker type adjusted for drug-to-antibody ratio. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 vs grade \u2264 2) and ADC linker type (cleavable vs non-cleavable) plus drugto-antibody ratio (numeric predictor) with the potential interaction between ADC linker type and drug-to-antibody ratio when estimable. The model includes the interaction when estimable since cleavability status and drug-to-antibody ratio are not necessarily independent factors but arise from the design of each medication. \n\n3. Linker type adjusted for estimated systemic free payload concentration. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 vs grade \u2264 2) and ADC linker type (cleavable vs non-cleavable) plus systemic free payload concentration (numeric predictor) with the potential interaction between ADC linker type and payload systemic free concentration when estimable. Again, the model includes the interaction when estimable since cleavability status and systemic free payload concentration are not necessarily independent factors but arise from the design of each medication. \n\nHeterogeneity in the estimated probability of each specific toxicity between studies was assessed with the I [2] statistic, describing the percentage of variation in probability of each specific toxicity across the studies arising from differences in the included trials (heterogeneity) rather than sampling error (chance).\n\n## Linker type and drug-to-antibody ratio\nWe further examined the potential association between ADC linker type and drug-to-antibody ratios and the estimated probabilities of systemic toxicity. Since the linker type and drug-to-antibody ratio are design features of each ADC and thus are not independent factors, the interaction between linker type and drug-to-antibody ratio was modeled and estimated whenever feasible. A summary of the results for the 21 toxicities are represented as a heatmap (Tables 3 and 4). The p-values are color-coded for level of significance and direction of association. \n\nFor grade \u2265 3 toxicities (Table 3), non-cleavable linkers remain significantly and independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p = 0.002), neutropenia (p = 0.021), leukopenia (p = 0.008), anemia (p = 0.001), pyrexia (p = 0.004), and peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.005) when adjusted for DAR and their interaction where estimable. In addition, higher DAR was significantly and independently associated with higher probability of grade \u2265 3 toxicity for any AE, neutropenia, anemia, nausea (p < 0.001), and peripheral neuropathy. Higher DAR was significantly and independently associated Table 4 Toxicity Any Grade by Cleavability of Linker, Drug-to-Antibody Ratio, and Interaction of Cleavability * Drug-to-Antibody Ratio with lower probability of grade \u2265 3 pyrexia. There were significant interaction terms between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p = 0.002), neutropenia (p = 0.042), leukopenia (p = 0.017), anemia (p = 0.001), and pyrexia (p = 0.006). These were all moderating interactions, indicating a lower toxicity then would be predicted from the additive effects of a linear increase in DAR and linker cleavability type. \n\nFor any grade toxicity (Table 4), non-cleavable linkers were not significantly and independently associated with toxicity adjusted for DAR and their interaction except lower ocular and higher headache toxicity of any grade.\n\n## Linker type, systemic free payload agent concentration, and toxicity\nNext we considered the potential association between ADC linker type and the systemic free payload concentration, including the potential interaction between linker type and systemic free payload concentration when estimable. These results are summarized as a heatmap of the p-values for the significance of the estimated coefficients for each factor in Tables 5 (toxicities \u2265 grade 3) and 6 (any grade toxicity). The p-values are color-coded for level of significance and direction of regression coefficient associations between systemic free payload concentrations and linker type. For grade \u2265 3 toxicities (Table 5), non-cleavable linkers remain significantly and independently associated with lower toxicity for only peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.001). Neutropenia, leukopenia, and pyrexia no longer had a significant independent association with linker type after adjustment for the systemic free payload concentration. In fact, the probability of any AE \u2265 grade 3 (p = 0.009) and anemia (p = 0.011) was higher in patients treated with non-cleavable linkers when adjusted for systemic free payload concentrations. Similarly, higher systemic free payload concentrations were significantly and independently associated with higher probability of anemia (p = 0.022) and pyrexia (p = 0.035). For any grade toxicities (Table 6), non-cleavable linkers remain independently associated with lower peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.025) but no other toxicity when adjusted for systemic free payload concentration. The main effect of higher systemic free payload concentration was significantly associated with increased probability for any toxicity (p = 0.043), anemia (p = 0.028), lymphopenia (p = 0.005), nausea (p < 0.001), vomiting (p = 0.006), constipation (p = 0.041), and interstitial lung disease (p < 0.001) after adjustment for linker type. \n\nAgain the I [2] statistics tend to be > 50% indicating at least moderate to high levels of heterogeneity in probabilities of the toxicities between studies.\n\n## Discussion\nIn this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies.",

                    "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

Cenciarelli, A. Hasan\n## Abstract\nThe primary purpose of ADCs is to increase the efficacy of anticancer medications by minimizing systemic drug distribution and targeting specific cells. Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies.\n## Linker design and technologies\nThe specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

Nishikawa, H. Yoshida\n## Abstract\nDespite recent advances in cancer treatment, the prognosis for uterine malignancies (carcinoma and sarcoma) requires further improvement. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel class of anti-cancer therapeutic agents, and multiple ADCs have been approved for other types of cancer. In 2024, trastuzumab deruxtecan received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for cancer types and became the first ADC approved for the treatment of uterine malignancies. Many ADCs are currently being investigated in uterine malignancies, and therefore, there is a need to gain a deeper understanding of ADCs. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in ADCs. The contents of this article include the structure and mechanism of action, an analysis of recent clinical trials, and expected future clinical questions. This article also focuses on uterine sarcoma, which is not often highlighted as a target for ADC treatment.\n## Linker\nLinkers bind the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

Substantial effort in ADC development is underway globally, with 13 ADCs currently approved and many more in development. The therapeutic benefits of ADCs leverage the ability to selectively target cancer cells through antibody binding, resultant relative sparing of non-malignant tissues, and the targeted delivery of a cytotoxic payload. Consequently, this drug class has demonstrated activity in multiple malignancies refractory to standard therapeutic options. Despite this, limitations exist, including narrow therapeutic windows, unique toxicity profiles, development of therapeutic resistance, and appropriate biomarker selection. This review will describe the development of ADCs, their mechanisms of action, pivotal trials, and approved indications and identify common themes. Current challenges and opportunities will be discussed for this drug class in cancer therapeutics at a time when significant developments in antibody therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted agents are occurring.",

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

Lim\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have provided new therapeutic options and significant promise for patients with cancer, particularly where existing treatments are limited. Substantial effort in ADC development is underway globally, with 13 ADCs currently approved and many more in development. The therapeutic benefits of ADCs leverage the ability to selectively target cancer cells through antibody binding, resultant relative sparing of non-malignant tissues, and the targeted delivery of a cytotoxic payload. Consequently, this drug class has demonstrated activity in multiple malignancies refractory to standard therapeutic options. Despite this, limitations exist, including narrow therapeutic windows, unique toxicity profiles, development of therapeutic resistance, and appropriate biomarker selection. This review will describe the development of ADCs, their mechanisms of action, pivotal trials, and approved indications and identify common themes. Current challenges and opportunities will be discussed for this drug class in cancer therapeutics at a time when significant developments in antibody therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted agents are occurring.\n## Linkers\nLinkers play a critical role in ensuring ADC stability and in optimising the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to tumour cells. Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

One such example of the smart chemotherapy approach is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which consist of an antibody that binds selectively to a cancer antigen linked to a cytotoxic agent. When developing an ADC, it may be necessary to produce a variety of constructs to fully assess the optimal configuration for the molecule. By testing ADCs prepared using a range of cytotoxic agents, linkers, or different antibodies, it is possible to fully assess the optimal approach for this treatment modality before advancing to the clinic. Since the development and approval of first-generation ADCs, significant improvements in development technology have occurred. Here, we consider the advances made within the field of ADCs, focusing on the development of EDO-B278 and EDO-B776, both of which have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical testing. Although some limitations remain in this field of development, the potential reduction in toxicity offered by ADCs justifies the investment in research to find workable solutions that could ultimately provide patients with superior outcomes.",

In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments [19]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue [19]. Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development [3,16].",

Mehrling, D. Soltis\n## Abstract\nAlthough considerable progress has been made in the field of cancer chemotherapy, there remains a significant unmet medical need, with a requirement to move away from traditional cytotoxics and explore novel, smarter chemotherapeutic approaches. One such example of the smart chemotherapy approach is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which consist of an antibody that binds selectively to a cancer antigen linked to a cytotoxic agent. When developing an ADC, it may be necessary to produce a variety of constructs to fully assess the optimal configuration for the molecule. By testing ADCs prepared using a range of cytotoxic agents, linkers, or different antibodies, it is possible to fully assess the optimal approach for this treatment modality before advancing to the clinic. Since the development and approval of first-generation ADCs, significant improvements in development technology have occurred. Here, we consider the advances made within the field of ADCs, focusing on the development of EDO-B278 and EDO-B776, both of which have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical testing. Although some limitations remain in this field of development, the potential reduction in toxicity offered by ADCs justifies the investment in research to find workable solutions that could ultimately provide patients with superior outcomes.\n## Optimising Composition of ADCs\npermit efficient release of the payload once internalisation into the malignant cell has occurred [14]. The stability of the linker can exert a considerable influence on the toxicities that might be associated with the active component of the ADC [11]. The most stable linkers will only release the chemotherapeutic component of the ADC in a target-specific manner; however, less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage, resulting in a broader toxicity profile [11]. In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments [19]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue [19]. Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development [3,16].",

Abstract Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are an innovative family of agents assembled through linking cytotoxic drugs (payloads) covalently to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to be delivered to tumor tissue that express their particular antigen, with the theoretical advantage of an augmented therapeutic ratio. As of June 2023, eleven ADCs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are on the market. These drugs have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium of acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemias, various types of lymphoma, breast, gastric or gastroesophageal junction, lung, urothelial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. They have proven to deliver more potent and effective anti-tumor activities than standard practice in a wide variety of indications. In addition to targeting antigen-expressing tumor cells, bystander effects have been engineered to extend cytotoxic killing to low-antigen-expressing or negative tumor cells in the heterogenous tumor milieu. Inevitably, myelosuppression is a common side effect with most of the ADCs due to the effects of the cytotoxic payload. Also, other unique side effects are specific to the tissue antigen that is targeted for, such as the cardiac toxicity with Her-2 targeting ADCs, and the hemorrhagic side effects with the tissue factor (TF) targeting Tisotumab vedotin. Further exciting developments are centered in the strategies to improve the tolerability and efficacy of the ADCs to improve the therapeutic window; as well as the development of novel payloads including (1) peptide\u2013drug conjugates (PDCs), with the peptide replacing the monoclonal antibody, rendering greater tumor penetration; (2) immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs), which upon conjugation of the antigen, cause an influx of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate dendritic cells and harness an anti-tumor T-cell response; and (3) the use of radioactive isotopes as a payload to enhance cytotoxic activity.",

Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.",

Balthasar\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are a rapidly expanding class of anti-cancer drugs, with twelve agents in current clinical use. Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.\n## Off-Target Delivery of ADC Payloads\nFollowing ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.\n...\nBesides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues.

            "abstract": "Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases, causing million of deaths each year globally. Conventional anti-cancer therapies are non-targeted and have systemic toxicities limiting their versatile applications in many cancers. So, there is an unmet need for more specific therapeutic options that will be effective as well as free from toxicities. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are suitable alternatives with the right potential and improved therapeutic index for cancer therapy. The ADCs are highly precise new class of biopharmaceutical products that covalently linked a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (binds explicitly to a tumor-associated surface antigen) with a customized cytotoxic drug (kills cancer cells) and tied via a chemical linker (releases the drug). Due to its precise design, it brings about the target cell killing sparing the normal counterpart and free from the toxicities of conventional chemotherapy. It has never been so easy to develop potential ADCs for successful therapeutic usage. With relentless efforts, it took almost a century for scientists to advance the formula and design ADCs for its current clinical applications.

Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

Abdus Salam, Sagnik Sengupta, Md. Yusuf Al-Amin, Saad Mustafa, Mohammad Aasif Khan, Xun Huang, J. Pawar\n## Abstract\nCancer is one of the deadliest diseases, causing million of deaths each year globally. Conventional anti-cancer therapies are non-targeted and have systemic toxicities limiting their versatile applications in many cancers. So, there is an unmet need for more specific therapeutic options that will be effective as well as free from toxicities. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are suitable alternatives with the right potential and improved therapeutic index for cancer therapy. The ADCs are highly precise new class of biopharmaceutical products that covalently linked a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (binds explicitly to a tumor-associated surface antigen) with a customized cytotoxic drug (kills cancer cells) and tied via a chemical linker (releases the drug). Due to its precise design, it brings about the target cell killing sparing the normal counterpart and free from the toxicities of conventional chemotherapy. It has never been so easy to develop potential ADCs for successful therapeutic usage. With relentless efforts, it took almost a century for scientists to advance the formula and design ADCs for its current clinical applications. Until now, several ADCs have passed successfully through preclinical and clinical trials and because of proven efficacy, a few are approved by the FDA to treat various cancer types. Even though ADCs posed some shortcomings like adverse effects and resistance at various stages of development, with continuous efforts most of these limitations are addressed and overcome to improve their efficacy. In this review, the basics of ADCs, physical and chemical properties, the evolution of design, limitations, and future potentials are discussed.\n## Linker\nThe biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20).

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have also revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Several ADCs have already been approved in hematology and clinical oncology, such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and enfortumab vedotin (EV) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. The efficacy of ADCs is limited by the emergence of resistance due to different mechanisms, such as antigen-related resistance, failure of internalization, impaired lysosomal function, and other mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the clinical data that contributed to the approval of T-DM1, T-DXd, SG, and EV. We also discuss the different mechanisms of resistance to ADCs, as well as the ways to overcome this resistance, such as bispecific ADCs and the combination of ADCs with immune-checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.",

These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

Lecesne\n## Abstract\nThe treatment of cancer patients has dramatically changed over the past decades with the advent of monoclonal antibodies, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, and innovative T-cell therapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have also revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Several ADCs have already been approved in hematology and clinical oncology, such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and enfortumab vedotin (EV) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. The efficacy of ADCs is limited by the emergence of resistance due to different mechanisms, such as antigen-related resistance, failure of internalization, impaired lysosomal function, and other mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the clinical data that contributed to the approval of T-DM1, T-DXd, SG, and EV. We also discuss the different mechanisms of resistance to ADCs, as well as the ways to overcome this resistance, such as bispecific ADCs and the combination of ADCs with immune-checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n## Linkers\nThe linkers connect the antibodies to the cytotoxic payloads and contribute to the stabilization of the ADCs [16]. These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

Despite advancements in treatment, challenges such as recurrence and low response rates persist. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various cancers, although their application in UC is currently limited. This review focuses on recent research regarding ADCs designed to treat UC by targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a surface antigen expressed on tumor cells. ADCs comprise three main components: an antibody, a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. The antibody selectively binds to tumor cell surface antigens, facilitating targeted delivery of the cytotoxic drug, while linkers play a crucial role in ensuring stability and controlled release of the payload. Cleavable linkers release the drug within tumor cells, while non-cleavable linkers ensure stability during circulation. The cytotoxic payload exerts its antitumor effect by disrupting cellular pathways. HER2 is commonly overexpressed in UCs, making it a potential therapeutic target. Several ADCs targeting HER2 have been approved for cancer treatment, but their use in UC is still being tested. Numerous HER2 ADCs have demonstrated significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in translational models of HER2-overexpressing bladder cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the efficacy and safety of ADCs targeting HER2 in UC, with the aim of determining tumor response and the potential of ADCs as a treatment option for UC patients.

It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

Traditional treatments often fail to provide long-term responses. Advances in molecular understanding of UC have led to targeted therapies, identifying six UC subclasses influencing treatment responses. Promising drugs include the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs represent a significant advancement in UC treatment, using monoclonal antibodies linked to cytotoxic agents to target cancer cells. UC is suitable for ADC therapy due to high antigen expression, enhancing efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC progresses rapidly with poor survival rates. Notable ADCs include enfortumab vedotin, effective alone and with pembrolizumab, and sacituzumab govitecan, showing effectiveness in studies. This review covers ADC mechanisms, mono- and combination therapies, resistance, and future perspectives, highlighting ADCs\u2019 vital role in treating UC. Abstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been a significant advancement in cancer therapy, particularly for urothelial cancer (UC). These innovative treatments, originally developed for hematological malignancies, use target-specific monoclonal antibodies linked to potent cytotoxic agents. This rational drug design efficiently delivers cancer cell-killing agents to cells expressing specific surface proteins, which are abundant in UC owing to their high antigen expression. UC is an ideal candidate for ADC therapy, as it enhances on-target efficacy while mitigating systemic toxicity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology and mechanisms of tumor progression in UC. However, despite the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC is characterized by rapid progression and poor survival rates. Targeted therapies that have been developed include the anti-nectin 4 ADC enfortumab vedotin and the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib. Enfortumab vedotin has shown efficacy in prospective studies in patients with advanced UC, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The anti-Trop-2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan has also demonstrated effectiveness in single-armed studies. This review highlights the mechanism of action of ADCs, their application in mono- and combination therapies, primary mechanisms of resistance, and future perspectives for their clinical use in UC treatment. ADCs have proven to be an increasingly vital component of the therapeutic landscape for urothelial carcinoma, filling a gap in the treatment of this progressive disease.",

Kwon, Seo-Yeon Lee, Tae Jeong, Hyeon Kim, Min-Kyung Lee\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary For metastatic urothelial cancer (UC), platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used, with newer treatments like monoclonal antibodies (e.g., pembrolizumab) showing varied success. Traditional treatments often fail to provide long-term responses. Advances in molecular understanding of UC have led to targeted therapies, identifying six UC subclasses influencing treatment responses. Promising drugs include the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs represent a significant advancement in UC treatment, using monoclonal antibodies linked to cytotoxic agents to target cancer cells. UC is suitable for ADC therapy due to high antigen expression, enhancing efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC progresses rapidly with poor survival rates. Notable ADCs include enfortumab vedotin, effective alone and with pembrolizumab, and sacituzumab govitecan, showing effectiveness in studies. This review covers ADC mechanisms, mono- and combination therapies, resistance, and future perspectives, highlighting ADCs\u2019 vital role in treating UC. Abstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been a significant advancement in cancer therapy, particularly for urothelial cancer (UC). These innovative treatments, originally developed for hematological malignancies, use target-specific monoclonal antibodies linked to potent cytotoxic agents. This rational drug design efficiently delivers cancer cell-killing agents to cells expressing specific surface proteins, which are abundant in UC owing to their high antigen expression. UC is an ideal candidate for ADC therapy, as it enhances on-target efficacy while mitigating systemic toxicity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology and mechanisms of tumor progression in UC. However, despite the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC is characterized by rapid progression and poor survival rates. Targeted therapies that have been developed include the anti-nectin 4 ADC enfortumab vedotin and the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib. Enfortumab vedotin has shown efficacy in prospective studies in patients with advanced UC, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The anti-Trop-2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan has also demonstrated effectiveness in single-armed studies. This review highlights the mechanism of action of ADCs, their application in mono- and combination therapies, primary mechanisms of resistance, and future perspectives for their clinical use in UC treatment. ADCs have proven to be an increasingly vital component of the therapeutic landscape for urothelial carcinoma, filling a gap in the treatment of this progressive disease.\n## Linker\nThe linker is essential in ADCs for connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic payload.The linker also is critical for the stability of the ADC and the controlled release of the payload, which significantly affects the therapeutic index [23].The primary function of a linker is to keep the cytotoxic payload securely attached to the antibody during circulation in the plasma, ensuring that drugs that cannot be systemically administered are delivered effectively.If the linker is unstable, it may cause premature release of the payload into the plasma, leading to systemic toxicity and diminished therapeutic efficacy [15].\n\nLinkers in ADCs are divided into two main subclasses: cleavable and noncleavable.Cleavable linkers release cytotoxic payloads in response to specific factors in the TME.They can be further divided into chemical cleavage linkers, such as hydrazone and disulfide bonds, and enzyme cleavage linkers, such as glucuronide and peptide bonds.Hydrazone linkers release payloads in the acidic environments of lysosomes and endosomes within cancer cells, but may also hydrolyze in plasma.Disulfide bond linkers, which are sensitive to reductive glutathione (GSH), are stable in the blood, but release their payloads in cancer cells with high GSH levels.Enzyme-sensitive linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, remain stable in the plasma and release drugs near tumors where lysosomal proteases are overexpressed.ADCs incorporating these linkers include brentuximab vedotin and sacituzumab govitecan [23].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or maleimidocaproyl groups, resist chemical and enzymatic environments in vivo and offer greater stability than cleavable linkers.They depend on the degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex for payload release, which is suitable for small molecules, as observed for ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), which uses a thioether linker [24].",

Their main roles are to prevent the premature release of the payload in the circulation while ensuring its release at the target site. Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads [45]. Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity [46,47]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells [48]. Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers [32,49]. One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) [50].",

Bian, S. Cohen, Anna-Maria Lazaratos, Nathaniel Bouganim, M. Dankner\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent an emerging class of targeted anticancer agents that have demonstrated impressive efficacy in numerous cancer types. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ADCs have become a component of the treatment armamentarium for a subset of patients with metastatic disease. Emerging data suggest that some ADCs exhibit impressive activity even in central nervous system (CNS) metastases, a disease site that is difficult to treat and associated with poor prognosis. Herein, we describe and summarize the existing evidence surrounding ADCs in NSCLC with a focus on CNS activity.\n## Linkers\nLinkers are molecular sequences that covalently connect the antibody to a cytotoxic payload. Their main roles are to prevent the premature release of the payload in the circulation while ensuring its release at the target site. Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads [45]. Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity [46,47]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells [48]. Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers [32,49]. One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) [50].",

Preventing deconjugation in the circulation reduces off-target toxicity and increases delivery of the drug to the tumor. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been explored, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) approaches can assist in this endeavor; recent computational QSP models incorporate ADC\u2010specific mechanisms and use data\u2010driven simulations to predict experimental outcomes. Various modeling approaches and platforms have been developed at the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical scales, and can be further integrated to facilitate preclinical to clinical translation. These new tools can help researchers better understand the nature and mechanisms of these targeted therapies to help achieve a more favorable therapeutic window. This review delves into the world of systems pharmacology modeling of ADCs, discussing various modeling efforts in the field thus far.\n## INTRODUCTION\nynthetic, covalent, chemical linkers connect the mAbs to the cytotoxic warheads to form the ADCs, which typically have a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) between one and eight, although most clinical-stage ADCs have an average DAR of 3.5-4. 20 Stability of the linker is crucial, as the ADC must hold onto its payload while in systemic circulation, only releasing the warhead once inside the appropriate cell. Preventing deconjugation in the circulation reduces off-target toxicity and increases delivery of the drug to the tumor. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been explored, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

ADC development requires the identification of appropriate tumour-associated antigens that can be targeted by the ADC to effectively kill cancer cells while minimising damage to healthy cells, thus limiting systemic toxicities. In this review, we examine the attributes of the antigens targeted by the anticancer ADCs that are clinically approved, and consider how these features may contribute to the safety and effectiveness of ADC therapeutics. Abstract Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are powerful anti-cancer therapies comprising an antibody joined to a cytotoxic payload through a chemical linker. ADCs exploit the specificity of antibodies for their target antigens, combined with the potency of cytotoxic drugs, to selectively kill target antigen-expressing tumour cells. The recent rapid advancement of the ADC field has so far yielded twelve and eight ADCs approved by the US and EU regulatory bodies, respectively. These serve as effective targeted treatments for several haematological and solid tumour types. In the development of an ADC, the judicious choice of an antibody target antigen with high expression on malignant cells but restricted expression on normal tissues and immune cells is considered crucial to achieve selectivity and potency while minimising on-target off-tumour toxicities. Aside from this paradigm, the selection of an antigen for an ADC requires consideration of several factors relating to the expression pattern and biological features of the target antigen. In this review, we discuss the attributes of antigens selected as targets for antibodies used in clinically approved ADCs for the treatment of haematological and solid malignancies. We discuss target expression, functions, and cellular kinetics, and we consider how these factors might contribute to ADC efficacy.",

Third, linkers may be cleaved intracellularly by thiol-disulphide bond exchange potentiated by thiols such as glutathione, which are expressed more highly in cancer cells compared with non-malignant cells [18,19].\n\nOn the other hand, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers depend entirely on internalisation followed by complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the entire conjugate to release the toxic payload [20].Non-cleavable linkers offer the advantage of increased plasma stability of the ADC complex, thus reducing the likelihood of premature payload release.This could potentially provide a larger therapeutic window and greater tolerance compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [21].\n\nDepending on the payload targets, which most often are tubulin or DNA, the liberated cytotoxic payload then leads to microtubule disruption in the cytosol or DNA damage in the nucleus, ultimately resulting in tumour cell death via apoptosis [3] (Figure 1C).",

Cheung, A. Chenoweth, D. Thurston, S. Karagiannis\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) provide effective anti-cancer treatments. ADC development requires the identification of appropriate tumour-associated antigens that can be targeted by the ADC to effectively kill cancer cells while minimising damage to healthy cells, thus limiting systemic toxicities. In this review, we examine the attributes of the antigens targeted by the anticancer ADCs that are clinically approved, and consider how these features may contribute to the safety and effectiveness of ADC therapeutics. Abstract Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are powerful anti-cancer therapies comprising an antibody joined to a cytotoxic payload through a chemical linker. ADCs exploit the specificity of antibodies for their target antigens, combined with the potency of cytotoxic drugs, to selectively kill target antigen-expressing tumour cells. The recent rapid advancement of the ADC field has so far yielded twelve and eight ADCs approved by the US and EU regulatory bodies, respectively. These serve as effective targeted treatments for several haematological and solid tumour types. In the development of an ADC, the judicious choice of an antibody target antigen with high expression on malignant cells but restricted expression on normal tissues and immune cells is considered crucial to achieve selectivity and potency while minimising on-target off-tumour toxicities. Aside from this paradigm, the selection of an antigen for an ADC requires consideration of several factors relating to the expression pattern and biological features of the target antigen. In this review, we discuss the attributes of antigens selected as targets for antibodies used in clinically approved ADCs for the treatment of haematological and solid malignancies. We discuss target expression, functions, and cellular kinetics, and we consider how these factors might contribute to ADC efficacy.\n## Mechanism of Action of ADCs\nThe canonical mechanism of action of ADCs has been well-characterised and involves binding of the antibody to its respective antigen on target cells before internalisation of the ADC by receptor-mediated endocytosis.Once internalised, antigen-ADC complexes in endosomes fuse with lysosomes (Figure 1B).Liberation of ADC payloads requires cleavage of the linkers at tumour sites, with systemic cleavage of ADC linkers minimised, thus theoretically avoiding serious systemic toxicities [18].Linker cleavage may be triggered by three major mechanisms.First, ADCs that are internalised by tumour cells may employ linkers susceptible to cleavage by intracellular-acting proteases that may be overexpressed in the tumour cells [18].Second, acid-labile linkers may be employed, which are cleaved by acidic conditions in the lysosomes post-internalisation. Third, linkers may be cleaved intracellularly by thiol-disulphide bond exchange potentiated by thiols such as glutathione, which are expressed more highly in cancer cells compared with non-malignant cells [18,19].\n\nOn the other hand, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers depend entirely on internalisation followed by complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the entire conjugate to release the toxic payload [20].Non-cleavable linkers offer the advantage of increased plasma stability of the ADC complex, thus reducing the likelihood of premature payload release.This could potentially provide a larger therapeutic window and greater tolerance compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [21].\n\nDepending on the payload targets, which most often are tubulin or DNA, the liberated cytotoxic payload then leads to microtubule disruption in the cytosol or DNA damage in the nucleus, ultimately resulting in tumour cell death via apoptosis [3] (Figure 1C).",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Survival for patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) is poor, especially in the advanced stage, where curative treatments are not available. While chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used in standard practice, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapy option. ADCs potentially enhance cancer cell death and reduce side effects. The anti-HER2 ADC Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) has shown survival benefit for patients whose tumours are HER2-positive, including a subgroup of BTCs. In April 2024, the regulatory authority FDA approved T-Dxd for adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours, including BTCs, lacking other treatment options. Ongoing trials are exploring other potentially actionable BTC molecular alterations. This review will discuss the current evidence and ongoing research in this subject area. Abstract Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive in nature, often presenting asymptomatically until they are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgical resection or liver transplantation are potential curative options. However, a large proportion of patients present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease and most of these patients are only eligible for palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. More recently, targeted therapies have proven beneficial in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on previous lines of systemic treatment. However, only a minority of patients with BTCs whose tumours harbour specific molecular alterations can access these therapies. Methods: In relation to ADCs, studies regarding use of antibody\u2013drug conjugates in cancer, particularly in BTCs, were searched in Embase (1974 to 2024) and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 2024) to obtain relevant articles. Examples of current clinical trials utilising ADC treatment in BTCs were extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry. Conclusions: Overall, this review has highlighted that ADCs have shown encouraging outcomes in cancer therapy, and this should lead to further research including in BTCs, where treatment options are often limited. The promising results observed with ADCs in various cancers underscore their potential as a transformative approach in oncology, warranting continued exploration and development and the need for education on the management of their specific toxicities. By addressing current challenges and optimising ADC design and application, future studies could potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with BTCs and beyond, potentially in both early and advanced stage settings.",

                    "text": "The linker is pivotal in ensuring that the antibody and payload are bound whilst in the bloodstream, subsequently releasing the cytotoxic payload into the target cancer cells. Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

Aleem, Timothy Jacobs, M. Frizziero, Victoria Foy, Richard Hubner, M. McNamara\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Survival for patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) is poor, especially in the advanced stage, where curative treatments are not available. While chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used in standard practice, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapy option. ADCs potentially enhance cancer cell death and reduce side effects. The anti-HER2 ADC Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) has shown survival benefit for patients whose tumours are HER2-positive, including a subgroup of BTCs. In April 2024, the regulatory authority FDA approved T-Dxd for adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours, including BTCs, lacking other treatment options. Ongoing trials are exploring other potentially actionable BTC molecular alterations. This review will discuss the current evidence and ongoing research in this subject area. Abstract Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive in nature, often presenting asymptomatically until they are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgical resection or liver transplantation are potential curative options. However, a large proportion of patients present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease and most of these patients are only eligible for palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. More recently, targeted therapies have proven beneficial in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on previous lines of systemic treatment. However, only a minority of patients with BTCs whose tumours harbour specific molecular alterations can access these therapies. Methods: In relation to ADCs, studies regarding use of antibody\u2013drug conjugates in cancer, particularly in BTCs, were searched in Embase (1974 to 2024) and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 2024) to obtain relevant articles. Examples of current clinical trials utilising ADC treatment in BTCs were extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry. Conclusions: Overall, this review has highlighted that ADCs have shown encouraging outcomes in cancer therapy, and this should lead to further research including in BTCs, where treatment options are often limited. The promising results observed with ADCs in various cancers underscore their potential as a transformative approach in oncology, warranting continued exploration and development and the need for education on the management of their specific toxicities. By addressing current challenges and optimising ADC design and application, future studies could potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with BTCs and beyond, potentially in both early and advanced stage settings.\n## Key Components and Mechanism of Action of ADCs\nThe linker is pivotal in ensuring that the antibody and payload are bound whilst in the bloodstream, subsequently releasing the cytotoxic payload into the target cancer cells. Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

These advances are largely based upon a body of investigational studies that together offer a deeper understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) fates of both the intact conjugate and its small-molecule component. Knowing where the drug goes and how it is processed allows mechanistic connections to be drawn with commonly observed clinical toxicities. The field is also starting to consider ADC interactions with the immune system and potential synergistic therapeutic opportunities therein. In an indication of future directions for the field, antibody conjugates bearing non-cytotoxic small-molecule payloads are being developed to reduce side effects associated with treatment of chronic diseases. ADCs are not a magic bullet to cure disease. However, they will increasingly become valuable therapeutic tools to improve patient outcomes across a variety of indications.\n## An Investigation of a Dose-Limiting Toxicity for MMAE Conjugates\nIf ADC off-target toxicity can be controlled, then the maximum tolerated dose can likely be increased, perhaps leading to better clinical response to treatment. Neutropenia is a common, often dose-limiting, toxicity noted in patients treated with ADCs conjugated to MMAE through a linker containing the protease cleavable dipeptide ValCit (vc) [13,14]. By contrast, patients treated with ADCs conjugated to the similar auristatin payload, MMAF, through a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (mc) linker, do not typically experience neutropenia. From these observations, it has been thought that proteolytic payload release mediates the toxicity, however the details have not been understood. Considering that nearly 30% of clinically-used ADCs carry a vc-MMAE linker/payload, and that fully 50% of ADCs in the clinic contain a cleavable dipeptidebased linker, understanding the mechanisms driving this toxicity could impact many therapeutic programs [7]. To this end, researchers from Agensys differentiated neutrophils in vitro and assessed the cells' sensitivity to ADC treatment at different stages of maturation [15]. Fullymature neutrophils were not affected by incubation with ADCs. By contrast, differentiating neutrophils were sensitive to treatment with vc-MMAE-conjugated ADCs but much less sensitive to mc-MMAF-conjugated ADCs. Further experiments showed that the developing neutrophils secreted the serine protease elastase, which could cleave the vc-MMAE linker and release free payload. The authors also investigated the role of Fc gamma receptor (FccR)mediated ADC internalization in neutrophil cytotoxicity. While this pathway was not required for sensitivity to vc-MMAE-conjugated ADCs, the modest sensitivity of differentiating neutrophils to mc-MMAF-conjugated ADCs could be attributed to this nonspecific interaction of ADC Fc constant region with FccRs expressed on developing neutrophils.",

Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut). The comparison of the Tab profile with the conjugated antibody profile allows for an assessment of linker stability as shown conceptually in Fig. 5, where the conjugated antibody concentrations for the more unstable linker decline much faster compared to that of the stable linker. \n\nDifferent types of linkers used on the same antibody can impact its pharmacokinetics as illustrated by the following examples. The pharmacokinetics of anti-HER2 ADCs was determined in mice using disulfide linkers with different hindered structures (32). The clearance of the ADC decreased with the increase in the degree of hindrance of the disulfide linker as follows: SPDP-DM1 (least hindered) > SPP-DM1 > SSNPP-DM3 > SSNPP-DM4 (most hindered).",

Kamath, S. Iyer\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging new class of targeted therapeutics for cancer that use antibodies to deliver cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells. There are two FDA approved ADCs on the market and over 30 ADCs in the clinical pipeline against a number of different cancer types. The structure of an ADC is very complex with multiple components and considerable efforts are ongoing to determine the attributes necessary for clinical success. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of an ADC and how it impacts efficacy and toxicity is a critical part of optimizing ADC design and delivery i.e., dose and schedule. This review discusses the pharmacokinetic considerations for an ADC and tools and strategies that can be used to evaluate molecules at the preclinical stage.\n## Linker\nAn important consideration impacting the pharmacokinetics of an ADC is the stability of linker. Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut). The comparison of the Tab profile with the conjugated antibody profile allows for an assessment of linker stability as shown conceptually in Fig. 5, where the conjugated antibody concentrations for the more unstable linker decline much faster compared to that of the stable linker. \n\nDifferent types of linkers used on the same antibody can impact its pharmacokinetics as illustrated by the following examples. The pharmacokinetics of anti-HER2 ADCs was determined in mice using disulfide linkers with different hindered structures (32). The clearance of the ADC decreased with the increase in the degree of hindrance of the disulfide linker as follows: SPDP-DM1 (least hindered) > SPP-DM1 > SSNPP-DM3 > SSNPP-DM4 (most hindered).",

The release mechanism of cleavable linkers is based on several characteristics of the physiological environment: (i) low pH values of the intracellular compartment compared to the neutral pH of the extracellular compartment (acid-labile linkers), (ii) the presence of proteases that release the drug at the area of junction (proteasecleavable linkers) and (iii) the high glutathione concentrations that reduce disulphide bridges (disulphide-linkers) [66].

After ADC internalization in the target cells, the monoclonal antibody is metabolized by the lysosomal proteolytic machinery into aminoacids, triggering the release of the antineoplastic bound to the linker and the amino acid appendages [67] (Figure 3). It should be considered that the ADCs developed using non-cleavable linkers are more stable. Moreover, this release mechanism prevents a premature drug release, reducing systemic toxicity [68].

Most of the ADCs developed so far are for treating cancer, but there is enormous potential for using ADCs to treat other diseases. Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications. The review discusses resistance mechanisms to ADCs, and give an opinion on future perspectives.",

They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

Pettinato\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are innovative biopharmaceutical products in which a monoclonal antibody is linked to a small molecule drug with a stable linker. Most of the ADCs developed so far are for treating cancer, but there is enormous potential for using ADCs to treat other diseases. Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications. The review discusses resistance mechanisms to ADCs, and give an opinion on future perspectives.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

Wan\n## Abstract\nBiologics mainly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as new therapeutics are becoming increasingly important biotherapeutics. This review is intended to provide an overall comparison between small molecules (SMs) and biologics or large molecules (LMs) concerning drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) or associated with absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) testing from pharmaceutical industry drug discovery and development points of view, which will help design and conduct relevant ADME testing for biologics such as mAbs and ADCs. Recent advancements in the ADME for testing biologics and related bioanalytical methods are discussed with an emphasis on ADC drug development as an example to understand its complexity and challenges from extensive in vitro characterization to in vivo animal PK studies. General non-clinical safety evaluations of biologics in particular for ADC drugs are outlined including drug-drug interaction (DDI) and metabolite/catabolite assessments. Regulatory guidance on the ADME testing and safety evaluations including immunogenicity as well as bioanalytical considerations are addressed for LMs. In addition, the preclinical and human PK data of two marked ADC drugs (ADCETRIS, SGN-35 and KADCYLA, T-DM1) as examples are briefly discussed with regard to PK considerations and PK/PD perspectives.\n## ADME testing of ADCs\nIt was shown that the terminal half-lives did not directly correlate with drug loading. When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

By combining the specificity of mABs with the high potency of the payloads, ADCs constitute a smart drug delivery system with improved therapeutic index. After recognition and binding of the mAB to its target surface antigen, ADCs are internalized by endocytosis by the tumor cell, releasing the payloads into the cytoplasm, where they exert their cytotoxic activity, eventually leading to cell death. The composition of some of the new ADCs confers additional functional properties that allow expanding their activity to neighboring cells not expressing the target antigen, constituting a valuable strategy to overcome tumor heterogeneity. Some of these \u2018off-target effects\u2019, such as the bystander effect, are possibly the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity demonstrated in patients with low expression of the target antigens, which represents an important paradigm shift in anticancer targeted therapy. Three ADCs are currently approved for the treatment of breast cancer (BC); two anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) ADCs (trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan); and one Trop-2-targeted ADC (sacituzumab govitecan).

Despite the remarkable advances, several hurdles still remain to overcome, including the development of reliable biomarkers for patient selection, prevention, and management of potentially severe toxicities, ADC resistance mechanisms, post-ADC resistance patterns, and optimal treatment sequencing and combinations. In this review, we will summarize the currently available evidence related to the use of these agents, as well as explore the current landscape of ADC development for BC treatment.\n## Molecular structure and mechanism of action of ADCs\nNon-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether linker present in T-DM1, provide a high stability to the compounds and allow a relatively delayed payload release, as this process relies on the lysosomal enzyme degradation of the ADC. 6Cleavable linkers can be subcategorized as chemically or enzyme-cleavable, and cleavage mechanisms may involve (1) internalization of the ADC-antigen complex by endocytosis, lysosomal processing, and intracellular payload release ('traditional' cleavage mechanism) or (2)  non-internalizing mechanisms, in which the payload is released extracellularly (e.g.tumor microenvironment or circulation). 10Non-internalizing mechanisms of payload release are hypothesized to be associated with potentially greater efficacy due to lower dependence on intracellular trafficking process and on high cell-surface antigen expression, but also lower cell selectivity. 10Thus, a significant part of off-target toxicity of newer generation ADCs has been associated to the premature payload release by cleavable linkers, which are subdivided into four main subclasses (hydrazone, cathepsin B-cleavable, disulfide, and pyrophosphate diester). 6yloads are the cytotoxic agents conjugated to the mAB, which are usually highly potent agents associated with excessive toxicity that precludes their use in the unconjugated form. 11Such a high potency, on the contrary, becomes a major advantage in the ADC context, considering that only a small amount of ADC administrated intravenously will reach tumor cells (as low as 0.001-0.01%)and that the payloads delivered need to be active at nanomolar or even picomolar concentrations. 12,13though the 'on-target' effect (i.e.cytotoxic effect after ADC internalization in cancer cells that express the target antigen) is hypothesized to be the main mechanism of action of ADCs, several features of the components of the ADC structure play a crucial role in other aspects that also contribute to their antitumor activity. 8",

Antibodies are unique medical elements due to their powerful properties of being able to recognize specific antigens and their therapeutic mechanisms such as blocking specific pathways, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, modification techniques have paved the way for improving antibody properties and to develop new classes of antibody-conjugate-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents. These techniques allow arming antibodies with various effector molecules. However, these techniques are utilizing the most frequently used amino acid residues for bioconjugation, such as cysteine and lysine. These bioconjugation approaches generate heterogeneous products with different functional and safety profiles. This is mainly due to the abundance of lysine and cysteine side chains. To overcome these limitations, different site-direct conjugation methods have been applied to arm the antibodies with therapeutic or diagnostics molecules to generate unified antibody conjugates with tailored properties. This review summarizes some of the enzyme-based site-specific conjugation approaches.",

Linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers can for example be split in the acidic environment of the lysosomes and therefore ensure a controlled releasing of the payload from the antibody. Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must undergo a complete proteasomal degradation before the payload is released.

Hussain, Armin Grimm, W. Sheng, Chao Zhang, M. Al-Rawe, K. Br\u00e4utigam, Mobarak Abu Mraheil, F. Zeppernick, I. Meinhold-Heerlein\n## Abstract\nIn the last few decades, antibody-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have been well established in medicine and have revolutionized cancer managements by improving tumor detection and treatment. Antibodies are unique medical elements due to their powerful properties of being able to recognize specific antigens and their therapeutic mechanisms such as blocking specific pathways, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, modification techniques have paved the way for improving antibody properties and to develop new classes of antibody-conjugate-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents. These techniques allow arming antibodies with various effector molecules. However, these techniques are utilizing the most frequently used amino acid residues for bioconjugation, such as cysteine and lysine. These bioconjugation approaches generate heterogeneous products with different functional and safety profiles. This is mainly due to the abundance of lysine and cysteine side chains. To overcome these limitations, different site-direct conjugation methods have been applied to arm the antibodies with therapeutic or diagnostics molecules to generate unified antibody conjugates with tailored properties. This review summarizes some of the enzyme-based site-specific conjugation approaches.\n## Linker\nThe most important feature for the linker is the stability in the blood plasma to avoid a systemic release of the payload, which would cause more side effects as well as reduce the efficacy and the therapeutic index of the ADC. Linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers can for example be split in the acidic environment of the lysosomes and therefore ensure a controlled releasing of the payload from the antibody. Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must undergo a complete proteasomal degradation before the payload is released. In some cases, this degradation does not lead to a complete separation of the payload from the antibody, so residues of the antibody can remain attached to the drug molecule. The remaining antibody residues could potentially interact with the function of the drug [16,19].",

ADCs typically consist of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) conjugated to the cytotoxic payloads by utilizing a linker, combining the benefits of definitive target specificity of mAbs and potent killing impact of payload to achieve precise and efficient elimination of target cells. In addition to their well-established role in oncology, ADCs are currently demonstrating encouraging potential in addressing the unmet requirements in the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prevalent long-term autoimmune disease RA costs billions of dollars annually but still, there is a lack of precision-targeted therapeutics with minimal side effects. This review provides an overview of the RA pathogenesis, pre-existing therapies, and their limitations, the introduction of ADCs in RA treatment, the mechanism of ADCs, and a summary of ADCs in preclinical and clinical trials. Based on the literature we also propose a strategy in ADC synthesis, which may increase the efficiency in targeting multifactorial diseases like RA. We propose to utilize DMARDs (Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), the first-line treatment for RA, as a payload for ADC synthesis. DMARDs are the only class of medication that limits the disease progression, but their efficacy is limited due to off-target toxicities. Hence, utilizing them as payload will help to deliver them directly at the targeted site, reducing their off-target toxicity, which in turn will increase their efficiency in targeting disease. Also, as mAbs are not sufficient to achieve remission, they are given in combinations with DMARDs. Hence, synthesizing ADCs may reduce the multiple and higher dosages given to patients, which in turn may enhance patient compliance.",

An\n## Abstract\nThe antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), a humanized or human monoclonal antibody conjugated with highly cytotoxic small molecules (payloads) through chemical linkers, is a novel therapeutic format and has great potential to make a paradigm shift in cancer chemotherapy. This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.\n## Non-cleavable Linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolytic degradation, ensuring greater stability than that of cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers rely on complete degradation of the antibody component of ADC by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which eventually liberates a payload molecule linked to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody (Fig. 8). As such, when coupled with a non-cleavable linker, the payload structure must be carefully selected and designed so that payload can exert comparable or even better anti-tumor potency in such a modified form. For that purpose, it may be necessary to examine PK/PD and toxicity profiles of all possible metabolites of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers. A successful example of ADCs using a non-cleavable linker is the humanized anti-HER2 antibody-maytansine conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, or Kadcyla \u00ae ) (LoRusso et al., 2011;Verma et al., 2012).",

This study explores key elements of ADC therapy, focusing on antibody development, linker design, and cytotoxic payload delivery. The global rise in cancer incidence has driven increased investment in anticancer agents, resulting in significant growth in the ADC therapy market. Over the past two decades, notable progress has been made, with approvals for 14 ADC treatments targeting various cancers by 2022. Diverse ADC therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors have emerged, with numerous candidates currently undergoing clinical trials. Recent years have seen a noteworthy increase in ADC therapy clinical trials, marked by the initiation of numerous new therapies in 2022. Research and development, coupled with patent applications, have intensified, notably from major companies like Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY, USA), AbbVie Pharmaceuticals Inc. (USA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Tarrytown, NY, USA), and Seagen Inc. (Bothell, WA, USA). While ADC therapy holds great promise in anticancer treatment, challenges persist, including premature payload release and immune-related side effects. Ongoing research and innovation are crucial for advancing ADC therapy. Future developments may include novel conjugation methods, stable linker designs, efficient payload delivery technologies, and integration with nanotechnology, driving the evolution of ADC therapy in anticancer treatment.",

This, in turn, significantly influences therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should avoid inducing ADC aggregation, prevent premature payload release in the bloodstream, and facilitate the release of active drugs precisely at the desired target. Linkers are broadly classified into two main types based on cellular metabolism processes [10][11][12][13]: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

This study explores key elements of ADC therapy, focusing on antibody development, linker design, and cytotoxic payload delivery. The global rise in cancer incidence has driven increased investment in anticancer agents, resulting in significant growth in the ADC therapy market. Over the past two decades, notable progress has been made, with approvals for 14 ADC treatments targeting various cancers by 2022. Diverse ADC therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors have emerged, with numerous candidates currently undergoing clinical trials. Recent years have seen a noteworthy increase in ADC therapy clinical trials, marked by the initiation of numerous new therapies in 2022. Research and development, coupled with patent applications, have intensified, notably from major companies like Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY, USA), AbbVie Pharmaceuticals Inc. (USA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Tarrytown, NY, USA), and Seagen Inc. (Bothell, WA, USA). While ADC therapy holds great promise in anticancer treatment, challenges persist, including premature payload release and immune-related side effects. Ongoing research and innovation are crucial for advancing ADC therapy. Future developments may include novel conjugation methods, stable linker designs, efficient payload delivery technologies, and integration with nanotechnology, driving the evolution of ADC therapy in anticancer treatment.\n## Linkers\nThe linker in ADCs plays a crucial role in bridging the antibody and the cytotoxic drug, representing a critical determinant of ADC stability and the profile of payload drug release. This, in turn, significantly influences therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should avoid inducing ADC aggregation, prevent premature payload release in the bloodstream, and facilitate the release of active drugs precisely at the desired target. Linkers are broadly classified into two main types based on cellular metabolism processes [10][11][12][13]: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

            "text": "The choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells [32,33]. The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC [20,[34][35][36][37][38]. Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow [39]. Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction [40]. Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy [41]. \n\nThe mechanism of drug release is an important consideration in linker selection. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been used in approved second-generation ADCs and in third-generation ADCs that are currently being investigated in clinical trials [42,43]. Collectively, linker stability during several days in the circulation and efficient cleavage upon delivery into the target cell, should be considered for effective linker design.",

We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.",

Only approximately 0.1% of the drug dose is delivered to the targeted diseased cell population after ADC drugs enter the human body, and the vast majority of the drug is distributed in the circulation or to normal cells, leading to unwanted toxicity. 64 A meta-analysis of adverse reactions in clinical trials of ADC drugs revealed that the incidence of all SG-related adverse events was as high as 97.1% (95% CI, 96.0-98.2%), and the incidence of \u2265 grade 3 treatment-related adverse events was 61.1% (95% CI, 57.6-64.6%). 65 To better exploit the therapeutic value of TROP-2 ADC drugs, exploring the mechanism of ADC drug adverse events and thus optimizing the management strategy of adverse events is one of the future research directions for TROP-2 ADC drugs. \n\nInstability of the coupling between the ADC linker and the cytotoxic drug can lead to off-target toxicity due to the premature release of the payload before reaching targeted tumor cells. There are two main types of ADC drug linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. However, in practice, cleavable linkers can be affected by poor plasma stability in circulation, and peptide-chain structure-based linkers with high sensitivity to proteases in serum or spontaneous decoupling can lead to the premature release of the payload before reaching the target tissues and the bystander effect, causing toxicity to normal cells owing to the increased ability of the drug to permeate cells. 66 Non-cleavable linkers can maintain high stability in the bloodstream, and internalization, lysosomal delivery and degradation of the ADC complex are necessary to release the active drug. The use of non-cleavable linkers reduces the probability of drug release from the extracellular space, but in contrast to cleavable linkers, they are unable to kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect. In addition, the coupling site of ADC drugs may also modulate the stability and pharmacokinetics of ADCs.",

            "text": "As ADCs are developed to limit their exposure to healthy tissues, they are associated with quite manageable toxicities, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue being among the most frequent ones. Unfortunately, the large amount of data provided by several clinical trials also highlights the presence of severe toxicities (grade 3 or higher) that include peripheral neuropathy and hematotoxicity, often dose-limiting (Masters et al., 2018;Professional Committee on Clinical Research of Oncology Drugs et al., 2022). Peripheral neuropathy includes tingling, pain in the extremities, numbness, and rarely muscle weakness and is commonly associated with ADCs carrying cleavable linkers bound to tubulin inhibitors (i.e., all ADCs loaded with MMAE) and Mirvetuximab soravtansine, carrying DM4 (Nguyen et al., 2023). As cleavable linkers are associated to the premature drug release and that these compounds block tubulin polymerization, this common side effect is not unexpected as microtubules are deeply involved in the axonal transport, an essential process to the growth and maturation of neurons (Yogev et al., 2016). Hematologic side effects include anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and are mainly due to the off-target Fc receptor-mediated uptake of ADCs into immune cells, with neutropenia being the most prominent toxicity in ADC-based monotherapy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides, major toxicities responsible for dose limitations are related to drug classes and mainly include hepatotoxicity (for MMAF, DM1, and calicheamicin), skin toxicity (for MMAE and PBD), and ocular toxicity (for MMAF and DM4) (Zhao et al., 2020;Hurwitz et al., 2023).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.",

Because Labetuzumab govitecan lacks internalization, this ADC drug will produce certain toxicity after entering Phase I studies [8,172]. Most studies have shown that the toxic effects caused by ADCs in clinical settings are mainly related to the payload. \n\nDifferent ADC components have markedly distinct AE spectra, as observed in the comparison between noncleavable and cleavable linkers. Noncleavable linkers are stable in plasma but have limited efficacy at the target cell, while cleavable linkers are unstable in plasma, leading to off-target toxicity, but have higher efficacy at the target cell [8,173]. Our meta-analysis showed that ADCs with cleavable linkers resulted in a higher overall incidence of any-grade and grade \u2265 3 AEs compared with noncleavable linkers. ADCs with both cleavable and noncleavable linkers are associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal and hematological AEs; however, ADCs with only cleavable linkers mainly cause neurological AEs while ADCs with noncleavable linkers are mainly associated with ophthalmic AEs. We did not carry out any further investigation to determine if specific AEs were more common in particular cancer types (e.g., pneumonitis in lung cancer or colitis in gastrointestinal cancer). \n\nPayload analysis revealed the highest difference in the overall incidence of any-grade and grade \u2265 3 AEs. Most payloads used in ADCs are highly cytotoxic and mediate the AEs of most ADCs. Our results showed that various payload was associated with an increased risk of any-grade AEs, and PBD dimer SG3199 and calicheamicin were associated with increased risks of grade \u2265 3 AEs. SN-38, PBD dimer SG3199, and MMAEs cause adverse respiratory effects, such as pneumonia, skin toxicity, and neurotoxicity, while deruxtecan, camptothecin, SN-38, and calicheamicin mainly cause hematologic toxicity and MMAF causes ophthalmic toxicity.",

This toxicity can be categorized into target-dependent toxicity (also known as on-target toxicity, Figure 1(b)), resulting from low target expression in healthy cells, and target-independent toxicity (off-target toxicity), arising from premature payload release, nonspecific endocytosis, or ADC receptor-mediated endocytosis (Figure 1(c)). Detailed mechanisms of ADC toxicity were extensively reviewed in previous articles. 2,17 l three components of ADCs-mAb, payload, and linker-can contribute to their toxicity, though the payload is primarily responsible for the majority of reported adverse effects. 18,19 imilar toxicities have been frequently reported with ADCs utilizing the same payloads. For example, grade \u2a7e3 anemia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy were frequently observed in ADC with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payloads, such as enfortumab vedotin (EV), brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and pinatuzumab vedotin. 20 Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and hepatic toxicity were commonly noted with ADC with mertansine (DM1), such as T-DM1. 20 Common payload-related toxicities are summarized in Table 1. \n\nWhile the linker appears nontoxic, its stability profoundly influences the overall toxicity profile. Linkers are categorized as either cleavable or noncleavable, depending on the presence of a chemical trigger within their structure. 21 A non-cleavable linker, lacking a chemical trigger, remains stable in systemic circulation until lysosomal release following internalization into target cells. By contrast, cleavable linkers possess a chemical trigger within their structure, enabling cleavage by envi-release in extra-tumoral compartments. 22 This instability enhances ADC efficacy through bystander effects 22 ; however, premature payload release is associated with increased off-target toxicity. 2,19,23",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51].\n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to",

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

            "text": "Following ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.",

Among DNA inhibitors, DNA damaging agents such as kanamycin and PBD, as well as topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin derivatives, may cause different toxic reactions, such as liver toxicity or gastrointestinal reactions (Nguyen et al., 2023). \n\nFinally, linkers play a crucial role in the effectiveness of ADCs. Although non cleavable linkers exhibit higher stability in plasma, ADCs drugs also have better tolerance in vivo. However, in the majority of ADCs approved by the FDA, particularly those utilized in solid tumors, cleavable linkers are the preferred option. This is due to the fact that cleavable molecules acting as linkers can influence the activation of specific sites and the killing effect of bystanders, which is of particular importance for solid tumors that typically express multiple antigens (Kondrashov et al., 2023). The cleavable linker is crucial for inducing bystander effect (Bargh et al., 2019). ADCs containing cleavable linkers are internalized by tumor cells with high antigen expression, and the drug is degraded in lysosomes, releasing free toxins that can directly kill target cells or reach the tumor microenvironment, attacking surrounding tumor cells with low or no antigen expression (known as bystander cells), thereby exhibiting the bystander effect (Giugliano et al., 2022). However, the bystander killing effect may also pose some challenges, such as increasing the risk of non-specific toxicity, as the payload may affect non tumor tissues. Therefore, the design of ADC needs to find a balance between achieving bystander killing effect and controlling non-specific toxicity.",

Unstable linkers can lead to premature release of the payload in the plasma, leading to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity [93]. The use of non-cleavable linker is an option; however, most payload requires conjugation via cleavable linker to achieve full potential. Nonetheless, linker is not the only component determining therapeutic window; the surface antigen, mAb structure, the degree of payload loading, payload type, and conjugation method can all impact ADC efficacy and toxicity profiles. \n\nTo date, no ADC delivering SMI targeting KRAS itself has been devised.

This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

            "text": "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy [34]. The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC. \n\nIn addition to the entry of released payload into non-targeted cells via passive diffusion across plasma membranes, the non-specific endocytosis of the intact ADC may also contribute to the off-site delivery of payload. Non-specific endocytosis may be influenced by the physicochemical properties of ADCs, including hydrophobicity and charge. Since most of the drug-linker compositions utilized in ADC technology are highly lipophilic, the hydrophobicity of the ADCs is often proportional to the drug loading (i.e., drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR). In a study by Hamblett et al., several anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADCs with DARs of two, four, and eight were evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity [35]. It was observed that the ADCs with higher DAR values had a faster systemic clearance, a lower tolerability, and a narrower therapeutic index than the ADCs with a lower DAR.",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

Off-target side toxicity remains a significant safety concern, hindering ADC development. Mechanistically, each of the three components of ADCs can contribute to their side toxicities. For instance, the non-specific expression of targeted antigens in normal cells can mistakenly deliver ADCs to the wrong site. Premature deconjugation of the toxic payload in circulation represents a key mechanism for severe side toxicity associated with the majority of ADCs. Notably, most of the FDA-approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, yet they are more vulnerable to plasma proteases and other enzymes compared to non-cleavable linkers. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may exhibit a favorable safety profile. However, they usually experience low efficacy issues. Thus, future studies developing novel strategies to overcome this unwanted toxicity are warranted.",

The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive). \n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect. The first FDA-approved ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae , used a hydrazine-based acid-cleavable linker. One of the most recently approved agents, Trodelvy \u00ae (sacituzumab govitecan), is using polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer technology.",

            "text": "The analysis of linker types was limited because only two approved ADCs-belantamab mafodotin and trastuzumab emtansine-utilize non-cleavable linkers, precluding meaningful comparisons across groups. Linkers are considered critical for ADC safety because they influence payload release. Designing linkers requires a careful balance between chemical stability and the controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. The ADC must remain stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the cytotoxic component, which could result in off-target toxicity. At the same time, the linker must allow for the effective release of the cytotoxic agent within the target cell after the ADC is internalized. The chemical composition of the linker, along with the conjugation method and site, plays a critical role in determining the DAR, as well as influencing the therapeutic index, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the ADC. In general terms, cleavable linkers may lead to faster payload release, potentially increasing off-target effects, while non-cleavable linkers generally improve ADC stability in circulation. In this context, recirculation of the ADCs can be higher for those with non-cleavable linkers. Additionally, ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) exhibit reduced heterogeneity in blood levels, which may lower the risk of extra-exposure to the payload [17]. In addition, the optimization of linkers could increase efficacy and safety. For instance, exo-linkers provide a two-step activation mechanism, where the first cleavage event exposes a secondary recognition site, ensuring greater stability in circulation and precise drug release in the tumor microenvironment [18]. Tandem-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, incorporate multiple cleavage mechanisms (e.g., protease-sensitive + redox-responsive) to enhance payload release efficiency within tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity, offering a promising strategy for next-generation ADCs [19].",

Recently, Burke et al reported PEGylated \u03b2-glucuronide-MMAE linkers that improved PK stability of ADCs with eight DARs, and increased potency in xenografts compared to the non-PEGylated controls (Burke et al., 2015 7 ). However, clinical improvement of the therapeutic window for ADCs using glucuronic acid-based linkers has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers: In contrast to the cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers that possess potent antitumor activity were unexpectedly discovered. Non-cleavable thioether and maleimidocaproyl (mc) linkers were initially synthesized for use as controls for the evaluation of cleavable linker conjugates. However, ADCs linked with these non-cleavable linkers, such as huC242-MCC-DM1 and cAC10-L4-MMAF, were as active as the conjugates with the cleavable linkers (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006). Studies on the mechanism of action of the non-cleavable linker conjugates showed that antibody degradation of ADC components in lysosomes, following internalization, was necessary and resulted in release of \"active\" cytotoxic payload derivatives. Interestingly, the payload from non-cleavable ADCs remained covalently bonded to the linker via the residues to which the linkers were conjugated (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006;Alley et al., 2008). This payload derivative then subsequently killed the target cells. Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers. However, additional efficacy from bystander effects are not",

            "text": "The used linkers should comply with two requirements: to have sufficient stability to allow prevent premature cleavage in the bloodstream and to be rapidly cleaved after ADC internalization to release the antineoplastic [63][64][65]. There are two different categories based on the release mechanism of the antineoplastic: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The release mechanism of cleavable linkers is based on several characteristics of the physiological environment: (i) low pH values of the intracellular compartment compared to the neutral pH of the extracellular compartment (acid-labile linkers), (ii) the presence of proteases that release the drug at the area of junction (proteasecleavable linkers) and (iii) the high glutathione concentrations that reduce disulphide bridges (disulphide-linkers) [66]. On the contrary, for non-cleavable linkers, there is no inbuilt chemical trigger to break the linker and release the cytotoxic payload. After ADC internalization in the target cells, the monoclonal antibody is metabolized by the lysosomal proteolytic machinery into aminoacids, triggering the release of the antineoplastic bound to the linker and the amino acid appendages [67] (Figure 3). It should be considered that the ADCs developed using non-cleavable linkers are more stable. Moreover, this release mechanism prevents a premature drug release, reducing systemic toxicity [68]. Nevertheless, it is required and efficient internalization and lysosomal trafficking. This release mechanism could also affect the drug effect, specially comparing with the use of cleavable linkers. In fact, the most used linkers in ADCs are cleavable linkers: acidcleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers (specially cathepsin cleavable-linkers), and disulfide-containing-reducible linkers [69]. \n\nThe selection of the linker depends on the antineoplastic payload, the monoclonal antibody, and the antigen target.",

            "text": "Linkers are short bridges that bind the drug to the antibody covalently. The stability of linkers is a significant challenge faced in ADC use. In blood circulation, a stable linker will keep the drug tightly intact to the antibody and perform intercellular cleavage after reaching the targeted cell. Linker acts as a critical parameter in ADC designation as it influences the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients. An unstable linkage will degrade and release the drug before reaching the targeted cell, leading to off-target cytotoxicity. Thus, an ADC's safety and efficacy will significantly reduce with an unstable linkage. The two main types of linkers include cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Although non-cleavable linkage performs better than the cleavable, the most suitable linkage for each ADC will be selected mainly based on its stability with the functional group of ADC and environment [149]. \n\nTo exert their cytotoxic effects, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an ADC drug with a noncleavable linker such as thioether, must be internalised by the target cell for the antibody and degraded before drug release. But since this type of ADC often comprises a potent tubulinbinding maytansine derivative which is DM1, the cleaved drug product would not reach neighbouring cells to exhibit bystander killing activity due to the low drug penetration (positively charged drug). As a result, non-cleavable ADCs are indeed efficacious against target antigen-expressing cells after internalisation and are favourable to malignancies with high and homogeneous antigen expression [145]. Despite the unpredictable translational consequences from pre-clinical to clinical trials, obtaining the most optimal dose would lead to a more precise therapeutic index assumption. It is recommended to use integrated linker design approaches to attain the highest intratumoural payload PK profiles by driving above the threshold dose [151].",

To demonstrate the effect of linker instability of ADC on toxicity, she presented the case study from Polson et al. 15 In this case, anti-CD22 antibody was conjugated to DM1 using linkers with various stabilities, and it was shown that: (1) un-cleavable linkers resulted in slower deconjugation and drug release in the systemic circulation, (2) cleavable linkers resulted in higher magnitude of weight loss in rats compared with non-cleavable linkers, and (3) more stable linkers resulted in reduced systemic toxicity of ADCs in rats as monitored by changes in AST, ALT, WBC, platelet, and neutrophil levels. As a case study to demonstrate the effect of ADC catabolism on ADC toxicity, Dr Schutten presented results showing increase in toxicity of trastuzumab-mc-vc-PAB-MMAF ADC by increasing the DAR. She also presented data from Junutula et al. 16 comparing THIOMAB-drug conjugates (TDC) with ADC, where it was shown that TDC resulted in slower catabolism of antibody compared with ADC, resulting in better toxicity profile for TDC conjugate. \n\nTo explain the unwanted ADC-mediated cytotoxicity, Dr Schutten first focused on the toxicity resulting from targeted binding of ADC to normal tissues expressing antigen. She presented a case study with the ADC-targeting leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), which is a marker for colon stem cells and postulated marker for colon cancer stem cells. It was observed that the LGR5-targeting ADC resulted in an on-target (intestinal stem cell-targeted) toxicity, leading to blunted or fused villi. She also presented data from CD22-targeting ADCs, where target-dependent depletion of replicating B cells by anti-CD22-vcMMAE ADC was observed in the monkeys.",

            "text": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].",

Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

Ideally, the linker should not interfere with the chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxicity, since the cytotoxic agent-linker by-product is what generates the innocent bystander effect. 16 In addition, the linker may serve to counteract resistance to the cytotoxic drug, since hydrophilic linkers generate metabolites that are not substrates for efflux or drug-expulsion active pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 17 wo main types of linkers are currently used in the development of ADCs: cleavable and non-cleavable. 17 leavable linkers are stable for as long as they are circulating and efficiently release the drug after the ADC is endocytosed by the tumor cell. Non-cleavable linkers remain bound to an amino acid of the antibody after its lysosomal degradation. This type of linker is unsuitable for inducing the innocent bystander effect, since the amino acid-linker-cytotoxic agent complex does not spread outside the tumor cell. 16 oth types of linkers take advantage of lysines or cysteines reactivity in the antibody to form covalent bonds. Conjugation to lysines is efficient, but it generates multiple antibody species with differences in the number of cytotoxic drug molecules and their localization. 18 In addition, since many reactive lysines are found in the C H 2 domain, conjugation increases ADC aggregation. 19 Conjugation to cysteines requires for them to be in their reduced form and, thus, if those that form interchain disulfide bridges are employed, linkers with two reactive groups must be used in order to allow the bridge to regenerate. This strategy allows better control of the number of molecules of the conjugated cytotoxic drug, but still, more than 100 ADC different species can be generated. 18 he diversity of species affects ADC's stability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 20",

            "text": "ADCs are designed to be target specific missiles. However, one of the major challenges with ADCs is off target toxicities that are a result of the cytotoxic small molecules released into the blood circulation prematurely. The risk associated increases depending on the toxicity profile linked to the cytotoxic small molecules [105]. The off-target toxicity liked to mertansine (DM1) is hepatotoxicity and thrombocytopenia; MMAE is linked to peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and the possibility of anemia; MMAF is linked to ocular toxicity [105][106][107]. In terms of the metabolic profile of ADCs, increased clearance rises from ADC hydrophobicity due to high drug loading of hydrophobic small molecules [65,108]. An in vivo study involving xenograft models compared the effect of a high drug loading of MMAE conjugated to anti-CD30 mAb with different DARs (2, 4 and 8) on ADC clearance. The results indicated that the higher the drug loading, the higher the clearance rate. In this study, the ADC with the DAR of 8 was most rapidly cleared [109].\n\nFurthermore, in addition to increased clearance rates, ADCs are also prone to aggregation. ADC aggregation is an obstacle in initial stages in the development of an ADC. It causes structural modification which can hinder its binding ability to the antigen. Apart from this, degradation by aggregation presents a major challenge in terms of meeting the guidelines for stability testing in order to gain eligibility for registration of the prescription medicine. Guidelines have been provided for this by the regulatory agencies such as the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA. This is discussed further in Section 6.3.\n\nMoreover, linkers have an essential role in maintaining the stability of ADCs in the systemic circulation. They are classed as non-cleavable or cleavable based on their release mechanism. The bystander effect is usually exhibited by ADCs with cleavable linkers, which has the potential to impact neighboring healthy cells [15,50,75]. It was argued that the bystander effect is not a limitation; in most cases it can be beneficial especially for cancers that have",

For example, valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) and phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), which confer excellent stability and PK/PD profile to ADCs, have been used in many ADCs for preclinical and clinical evaluations. In addition, the ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors [51,53]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated [54,55]. In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities [54].",

Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43].

On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease.

Apart from the improved linker stabilities, more potent microtubule-targeting agents (such as auristatin and maytansinoids derivatives) were used as the cytotoxic payload to improve the general potency of ADC [1]. \n\nNonetheless, the second-generation ADC still utilizes non-specific site conjugation for the incorporation of antibodies, which generally produces ADC as heterogeneous mixtures with the drug to antibody ratio (DAR) varying from zero to eight. Furthermore, lower potency could be one of the problems due to competition from those unconjugated antibodies available in the product [90]. Additionally, off-target toxicity is still prevalent due to the non-differentiated triggers present in healthy tissue; for instance, the Val-Cit linker becomes unstable in the presence of carboxylesterase 1C (Ces 1C) enzyme, as reported in recent research on mouse models [7]. Similar to second generation ADC, the third generation ADC predominantly uses enzyme cleavable linker, albeit applying it in sidespecific conjugation to the antibody to improve the pharmacokinetics as well as its DAR [94]. \n\nAlthough with continuous and extensive efforts, the conventional ADC with internal trigger-linker is still plagued with relatively poor therapeutic index, which has limited the implementations in the pharmaceutical industry, where there were 23 out of 55 conventional ADCs that were terminated due to this very same reason [95].",

            "text": "The chemical linker in ADC conjoins cytotoxic payload to the antibody, stabilising the circulating ADC in the bloodstream upon administration. The functional group of linkers and the conjugation site determine the performance of ADCs in terms of circulating half-life, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles, and therapeutic window [14]. Disulfide, thioether, and hydrazone functional groups combine antibodies to the cytotoxic agent through intermolecular interactions. Currently, available linkers based on mechanisms of payload release are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological environment in the systemic circulation, such as pH or proteases available to release cytotoxic payload from the carrier. For example, the acid-labile linker in Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin is cleaved under low pH conditions. In contrast, protease cleavable linker in Brentuximab Vedotin is cleaved by proteases such as Cathepsin-B and plasmin. The cleavage of disulfide linkers in mirvetuximab soravtansine depends on high glutathione concentrations [15]. Non-cleavable linkers form non-reducible covalent bonds with amino acids on the antibodies. Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation [16]. In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 [2]. This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity. One of the popular non-cleavable linkers is the polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker due to its excellent water solubility, lack of toxicity and low immunogenicity.",

The stability of the linker can exert a considerable influence on the toxicities that might be associated with the active component of the ADC [11]. The most stable linkers will only release the chemotherapeutic component of the ADC in a target-specific manner; however, less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage, resulting in a broader toxicity profile [11]. In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments [19]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue [19]. Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development [3,16].",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. The cAC10-L4-MMAF in which cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic auristatin derivative MMAF via a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker was approximately as potent as cAC10-L1-MMAF with a dipeptide linker in vitro against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo (Figure 5) [48,49].",

The results here show that linker choice and the potential for premature payload release among ADCs can affect their systemic toxicity and efficacy. It will, therefore, be critical in the design of future ADCs to find the appropriate balance between the highest potential efficacy and associated systemic toxicities [49]. In this regard, contemporary studies are focused on the development of novel ADC linkers that can be released conditionally within the tumor microenvironment to increase both the specificity of drug delivery and anti-tumor efficacy. The ideal ADC design should aim for high therapeutic index that balances off-target toxicities, taking into consideration factors such as linker cleavability, DAR, and payload membrane permeability [50]. The results presented here suggest one critical consideration in achieving this balance during future ADC development for cancer patients will be linker design and the potential for premature payload release.",

Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

            "text": "In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

An ideal linker enables the payloads to remain firmly attached to the antibody in circulation, while ensuring valid release of the payloads inside the cancer cells. The linkers of ADCs can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable [7]. Non-cleavable linkers commonly have great circulation stability, but rely on lysosomal degradation to release payloads. However, payloads with non-cleavable linkers display a reduced cell permeability and bystander effect. By contrast, cleavable linkers can be broken down by tumor-associated enzymes to release the payload [24]. Cell permeable payloads with cleavable linkers exert bystander effects, but are associated with off-target toxicities. For ADCs of breast cancer, the thioether linker used in T-DM1 is non-cleavable, while the linkers used in T-DXd and SG are cleavable [11]. Therefore, the optimal linker should balance stability, efficacy and safety of ADCs.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH Enzyme-labile \u00df-Glucuronide linker Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment. Mylotarg, for example, was generated by conjugating calicheamicin with mAb against the CD33 antigen through an acid-cleavable hydrazine linker [52]. Protease-cleavable linkers are also used to keep ADCs intact in systemic circulation and allow easy release of the cytotoxic drugs from ADCs by lysosomal enzymes within cancer cells.",

            "text": "Linkers play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and safety of ADCs. It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

Linkers, which are generally divided into cleavable and non-cleavable types, are designed to be stable in the bloodstream while allowing efficient release of the small molecule cytotoxin after internalization in the target cell [58]. The stability of antibody-drug linkers in systemic circulation has been a key focus in safety evaluations, since premature loss of the small molecule prior to ADC target cell internalization can result in off-target toxicity from non-specific drug release [59]. Strategies to develop ADCs with more stable linkers and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs have been viewed as critical to the effort to improve ADC pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles [13,60]. \n\nAn insufficiently stable linker was thought to represent a possible liability for Mylotarg, although subsequent ADCs utilizing similar acid-labile hydrazone linkers, e.g., inotuzumab ozogamicin and milatuzumab-doxorubicin, have shown good stability in human plasma and serum [14]. However, a comparison of ADCs containing hydrazone linkers with those using protease-sensitive dipeptide linkers showed that the peptide-linked conjugates were much more stable in buffers and plasma than the corresponding hydrazone conjugates, and as a result exhibited more specific delivery and lower systemic toxicity [61]. These results illustrated the importance of conjugation and linker chemistry in achieving a favorable therapeutic index. \n\nSpecies differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies.",

            "text": "One of the fundamental lessons learned from the first gen- eration of ADCs is that a suitably stable linker is as vital as the antibody and payload for maximization of therapeutic efficacy of the ADC. The ideal linker is systemically stable so that biophysiochemcial property of ADC are similar to that of the unconjugated antibody, but are still able to release the payload at the target site. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel linkers for ADCs, and the most broadly evaluated and utilized linker platforms include both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers: The cleavable linkers include chemically-labile (e.g., hydrazones and disulfides) and protease-labile linkers. These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (van Der Velden et al., 2001;Ulbrich and Subr, 2004). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003;Erickson et al., 2006;Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency.\n\nThe peptide-based linkers are also designed to be retained in the ADC formin circulation, but to release their payload upon cleavage by specific intracellular proteases. For example, Adcetris \u00ae uses the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, which is hydrolyzed by",

Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

Linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers can for example be split in the acidic environment of the lysosomes and therefore ensure a controlled releasing of the payload from the antibody. Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must undergo a complete proteasomal degradation before the payload is released. In some cases, this degradation does not lead to a complete separation of the payload from the antibody, so residues of the antibody can remain attached to the drug molecule. The remaining antibody residues could potentially interact with the function of the drug [16,19].",

She presented data on weight loss in mice administered an antibody conjugated to DM4 through either a cleavable or non-cleavable linker. The difference in the highest non-toxic dose was nearly 3-fold, suggesting that the non-cleavable linker could increase the safety margin for an ADC. However, she also presented data on antitumor activity that suggested the cleavable linker may be active against a broader array of tumor types compared to the non-cleavable linker. Taken together, the data for the two types of linkers suggests that a compromise between safety and activity may be required.\n\nThe impact of the cytotoxic element on the safety and efficacy of ADCs was Dr. Blanc's final topic. She discussed clinical data for ADCs that included either a DNA-binding drug or a maytansinoid. These ADCs had differences in the maximum tolerated dose of 20-to 80-fold. She noted that no conclusions can be drawn from the data on adverse events. Dr. Blanc emphasized that achieving a sufficient pharmacological index was critical to ADC development, and that ADCs that included both types of drug have had issues with toxicity or efficacy, e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin, AVE9633. In the case of AVE9633, there were no dose limiting toxicities at 260 mg/m 2 , but the ADC was not effective despite the fact that all the sites on tumor cells were saturated. Dr. Blanc reiterated the point also made by Dr. Lutz that diversity of mechanism of action is desirable because not all tumors respond to the same drug. Dr. Blanc concluded by noting that the challenge of ADC development is to find the right targets, especially regarding the safety profile and capacity to internalize the drug; select the right cytotoxic agent based on the indication; select the best antibody, likely based on an empirical approach; and find a linker that is adapted to the type of tumor and provides the desired safety profile.\n\nCalicheamicin antibodies and beyond were discussed by Hans-Peter Gerber (Pfizer BioTherapeutics).

            "text": "Linkers are the most important and intricate part in the development of a successful ADC, since they form the link between the therapy and antibody. Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers.",

Generally, the properties of linkers can be altered by the cytotoxic payload release mechanism 191 . Cytotoxic payload in ADC technology must be released into the cell to exert its therapeutic activity, thus ADC linkers should be chosen based on their stability to keep ADC intact during circulation and capable of cleaving inside the targeted cell 191,192 . Linker stability is defined based on lack/low level of cleaving agents (e.g., protease or reductive agents) in the bloodstream compared to the cytoplasm 163 .\n\nThe current linkers used in ADCs are also broadly classified as cleavable and noncleavable linkers based on where they are cleaved into the cytoplasm. Cleavable linkers are those containing a conditional cleavage sites sensitive to be cleaved immediately after ADC internalization, such as VC, SPDB, SPP, and hydrazine which can be triggered through protease reactions, glutathione reduction, and acidic pH, respectively 163,164 . Noncleavable linkers are stable from early to late endosome transition and their cytotoxic partner is just released by degradation of antibody in lysosomes, e.g. MCC and MC linkers that link Ab to the payload via thioether linkage 190 .\n\nCharacteristics of ADC target such as copy number, internalization rate and level of homogeneity should be considered in conjugation method and linker selection. For instance, ADC with disulfide-linkage has been shown to have more cytotoxic activity than the same ADC with thioether linkage when they were directed to the tumor cell lines expressing a low copy number of targeted antigen 17 .\n\nCleavable linkers may increase the possibility of bystander effect 27 .

            "text": "ADCs have been designed as a platform for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents directly into cancer cells. The objective was to increase their activity, with a significant reduction in side effects and treatment-related complications. Indeed, most of the approved ADCs have a better overall safety profile than chemotherapy, in headto-head comparisons. However, as we have seen summarized in this review, some \"chemotherapy-related\" side effects (such as hematological toxicity, nausea/ vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) have been reported, together with new uncommon toxicities (ILD, ocular disorders). In particular, ADCs may cause toxicities through different mechanisms, depending on the chemical properties of the payload (i.e., hydrophilic), the drug-toantibody ratio (DAR), as well as the stability of the linker (cleavable or not) and the expression of the target in non-cancer tissues. Payloads of the currently available ADCs are drugs initially developed for intravenous use and some of them have been known for decades (Supplementary Table S9). Interestingly, some of the systemic AEs described here are similar to those reported in the older trials with the free respective payloads or parent compounds, clearly suggesting that significant amounts of payload may recirculate in the bloodstream. \n\nIn fact, due to the proteolytic-rich tumor microenvironment, 87 a cleavable linker may release unpredictable amounts of its payload at the extracellular level. While this property is considered a strength in terms of antitumor activity (the bystander effect), on the other hand, it allows the free payload to re-enter the bloodstream, causing toxicities in other sites (off-tumor, off-target). On the other hand, it has been noted that ADCs with more stable linkers may be able to interact with albumin as a carrier, prolonging the patients' exposition to the drug. 88 n addition, ADCs have also peculiar toxicities related to antibody/epitope recognition, as in case of the ADCs targeting the Trop2 receptor, widely expressed on skin and mucosae.",

These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

            "text": "Antibodyedrug conjugate (ADC), comprising a monoclonal antibody (mAb), the cytotoxic payload and the linker, has developed rapidly in recent years and is gradually revolutionizing clinical cancer therapy. This technology appeared a century ago 1 , but it is becoming mature in the past 5 years. Currently, 10 ADCs have been approved and more than 80 ADCs are at different phases of clinical trials 2e8 . \n\nThe linker connects the antibody and the cytotoxic payload and is a key component in the function of ADCs. The linker imparts the following characteristics to ADCs: (1) high stability in the circulation, and (2) specific release of payload in the target tissue. These seemingly contradictory requirements of stability and release lead to the major challenge in the development of linkers. To achieve the above requirement, various linkers have been developed and can be divided into two types according to their cleavage method. The first type is the cleavable linker, which has a chemical trigger in its structure that can be efficiently cleaved to release the cytotoxic payload in the tumor. More than 80% of the clinically approved ADCs employ cleavable linkers 9 , such as inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) 10,11 . The other type of linker is noncleavable. In contrast to the cleavable linker, there are no chemical triggers in this structure, and the linker is part of the payload. This type of linker has been employed only in adotrastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) among the approved ADCs 12 . \n\nAlthough ADCs have achieved great success, future development is increasingly constrained by the linkers. The defects of the classical linkers employed in the marketed ADCs include the following aspects: (1) the nonspecific release of payloads in nontumorous tissues, leading to off-target toxicity and a limited therapeutic window. The most notable case is that of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) developed by Pfizer.",

            "text": "This is because only a small fraction of the ADC dose reaches its target, with some payloads being prematurely released, exposing healthy cells to the drug [77]. The linker technology in ADCs contributes to off-target toxicities, especially with cleavable linkers that may release the payload too early [78]. And ADC payloads are typically more toxic than traditional chemotherapy, leading to serious side effects in non-target cells [79]. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of ADCs, such as rapid clearance or excessive accumulation, can further impact their toxicity and efficacy [80]. In addition, ADCs are developed to limit their exposure to healthy tissues, they are associated with quite manageable toxicities, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue being among the most frequent ones. Unfortunately, the large amount of data provided by several clinical trials also highlights the presence of severe toxicities (grade 3 or higher) that include peripheral neuropathy and hematotoxicity [81]. Trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, both targeting HER2 + , have also been linked to an increased risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis [82]. Tumor cells may develop resistance to ADCs through mechanisms like downregulating antigen expression, increasing drug efflux, or altering metabolic pathways. To address these challenges, new antibody formats, delivery systems, non-internalizing targets, cytotoxic agents, and site-specific bioconjugation methods are being explored to improve ADC development. \n\nThe therapeutic potential of ADCs is immense, but several key challenges need to be addressed, including drug resistance, intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity, and the risk of TRAEs. Emerging ADC modalities, such as bispecific and dual-drug ADCs, show promise in overcoming resistance and tumor heterogeneity [83]. Additionally, novel designs featuring conditionally active antibodies, known as probody-drug conjugates, could enhance tumor specificity and reduce adverse events [84].",

            "text": "These therapeutic effects have most recently been achieved, largely due to new ADC linker chemistries that stabilize the ADC in the bloodstream and maximize the tumorspecific delivery of the cytotoxic payload [11]. Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action [14]. Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes [15]. Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing [16]. Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC [17,18] and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers [19][20][21]. Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14].",

Furthermore, it outlines the integral features of current and newly developed linkers. Linkers fall into one of two categories: cleavable or non-cleavable. They have an important role in maintaining the stability of the ADC to avoid premature release of the highly cytotoxic drug cargo in the circulation which leads to an array of systemic toxicities. The cytotoxic drug cargo has a pivotal role in exerting cell death and apoptosis upon reaching the tumor site. They are classed depending on their ability to damage DNA or inhibit tubulin polymerization. The features and application of the payloads used in ADC conjugation are delineated in this review.\n\nAmidst the success and excitement in the progress of ADC development lies other complexities and limitations, including rapid ADC clearance and drug resistance mechanisms that hinder these target specific missiles from exerting their optimal effects. Outlined in this review are some proposed strategies to overcome these limitations. Protein aggregation is one of the major hurdles in ADC development; management and control of aggregation can be challenging for ADCs. The review illustrates the common causes of aggregation and characterization techniques that can assist in detecting the presence of aggregates. Further investigation regarding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of the proposed strategies as well as other mechanisms of resistance that tumor cells use to evade treatment is required.",

            "text": "According to the mechanism of payload release, the linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable 19 . Cleavable linkers were designed with a built-in chemical trigger to cleave the linker. They exploit the distinct characteristics between tumor cells and the systemic circulation to precisely release cytotoxic drugs. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers were usually designed with amino acid functional group to connect to the payload. Upon entering into the cells and particularly lysosomes, the amino acid-based linkage is cleaved via a proteolytic reaction to release the payload with an amino acid appendage 20 . The chemical properties of the linker affect the stability of the ADCs and the release of the payloads, which is also the major factor determining the toxicity of the ADCs 21 . An ideal linker is expected to be stable in the blood circulation and the anticancer drug payload should not be released prematurely in the blood to avoid causing non-specific toxicity to healthy tissues. When the ADCs reach the tumor surface and are transported into the lysosome, the linker should be rapidly disassembled to release the payload and exert an antitumor effect 7,22 . Another important property of the linker is hydrophilicity. It has been shown that linkers with too many hydrophobic groups tend to promote aggregation of the ADC molecules and cause severe hepatotoxicity 23,24 .",

            "text": "Target-independent uptake toxicity [15], dose-limiting neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [3][4][5][6]8,16] are major causes of concern in ADC development. It has been shown that ADC treatment often leads to neutropenia in cancer patients [17], especially when employing ValCitPABC-MMAE. Zhao et al. [17] employed purified neutrophil elastase, a serine protease, to evaluate the in vitro stability of ADCs with a cleavable valine-citrulline linker (vc-MMAE), or a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker (mc-MMAF), and showed that the ValCit linker was readily cleaved by elastase to release free MMAE, whereas the MC linker was not. \n\nA number of recent review articles have covered ADC linkers designed on cleavage mechanisms by lysosomal enzymes like cathepsins, phosphatases, pyrophosphatases, sulfatases, \u03b2-galactosidase, and \u03b2-glucuronidase, as well as via the reduction of disulfide linkages by glutathione [18][19][20][21][22]. In this mini review, we attempt to capture the most recent developments in the design of peptide linkers with improved selectivity towards specific cleavage enzymes in lysosomes and increased stability in plasma.",

            "text": "Linkers are a critical component of the ADC and are key to the design of a safe, potent, and selective ADC [86]. Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects [86]. Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism [86]. Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment [86]. Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants [86,94]. Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome [86]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life [86].",

            "text": "The conjugating linkers in ADCs are generally classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones, which behave quite differently in a biological system, and produce distinct in vivo forms of released toxin. Specifically, cleavable linkers (e.g., valine-citrulline dipeptide, hydrazine, and disulfide bridge) could be sensitive to cancer cell-specific intracellular properties, such as expression of certain protease, pH, and glutathione, and thus carrying the potential to achieve selective release of payloads [3]. By comparison, non-cleavable linkers contain no specific release mechanism and rely on intracellular proteolytic degradation following ADC internalization [3]. From an analytical perspective, while ADCs with cleavable linkers release free payload in a biological system, those with non-cleavable linkers usually release active payload-linker-amino acid moieties that are produced after the complete degradation of ADCs [3]; consequently, different analytes should be targeted. \n\nDue to the high complexity of ADCs, analysis of these compounds is uniquely challenging, especially in a biological system. For instance, both the small-molecule payloads and the protein portion need to be analyzed. In addition, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is an important parameter describing the number of payloads conjugated to the antibody since the DAR species could dynamically change in vivo, which brings additional challenges for bioanalysis. Compared to other traditional methods, liquid chromatographyemass spectrometry (LC-MS) has the unique capability in ADC analysis, since it can broadly analyze small molecules, intact proteins, digested proteins, as well as specific domain of proteins with the molecule-level resolution. Therefore, LC-MS represents a highly versatile and valuable tool and has played an indispensable role in ADC characterization, both quantitatively and qualitatively. \n\nIn the initial development stage, especially for linker and payload discovery, LC-MS is highly valuable in providing structureactivity relationship information [4]. LC-MS has also been widely employed in characterization of the physicochemical properties of ADCs, which have profound effects on the safety and efficacy profile [5].",

Ideal linkers should ensure ADCs stability in the bloodstream but release payloads at the tumor site. \n\nThe conjugation site has a significant impact on the stability and pharmacokinetics of ADCs. Site-specific binding produces homogeneous ADCs whose properties can be tailored to maximise therapeutic range (7). \n\nLinkers can be categorised into cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release the payload based on some factors of cancer cell such as pH, reducing agents and lysosomal protease. While cleavable linkers have the advantage of providing a bystander effect, they have the disadvantage of increased toxicity in normal tissues. Conversely, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasm, so that they release payload only after complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody and limit premature release of payload. Whereas these features of non-cleavable linkers offer less toxicity, bystander effect is not expected because of the extremely low cell membrane permeability. Among the 13 approved ADCs, cleavable linkers are the most common (11 of 13) and noncleavable linkers are only two (trastuzumab emtansine, belantamab mafodotin).",

Non-cleavable linkers rely on complete degradation of the antibody component of ADC by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which eventually liberates a payload molecule linked to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody (Fig. 8). As such, when coupled with a non-cleavable linker, the payload structure must be carefully selected and designed so that payload can exert comparable or even better anti-tumor potency in such a modified form. For that purpose, it may be necessary to examine PK/PD and toxicity profiles of all possible metabolites of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers. A successful example of ADCs using a non-cleavable linker is the humanized anti-HER2 antibody-maytansine conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, or Kadcyla \u00ae ) (LoRusso et al., 2011;Verma et al., 2012).",

            "text": "In this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

            "text": "The use of EVCit or similar peptide linkers (e.g., EVA, DVCit, DVA) could serve as a simple but powerful solution to salvage many types of ADCs previously abandoned due to linker instability in mouse models. The high polarity of the EVCit linker could also help mitigate the aggregation and fast clearance issues associated with hydrophobic high-DAR ADCs 38 . In addition, EVCit linkers may be preferentially chosen over non-cleavable linkers in the future design of various ADCs. Non-cleavable linkers are designed to withstand proteolytic degradation in circulation. They have been successfully used for constructing potent ADCs along with MMAF 39 , monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) 40 , and emtansine (DM1) 7,8 . However, the use of non-cleavable linkers reportedly attenuates or nullifies ADC potency of some payload molecules including doxorubicin 39 , monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) 34,39 , a hydrophilic auristatin derivative 41 , and a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) 34 . Attenuation of ADC potency arises because non-cleavable linkers lack a defined cleavage mechanism; after intracellular protein degradation, final active metabolites retain the linker component. It has been demonstrated that this drawback can be circumvented in some cases by fine-tuning the chemical structures of the linker and payload 42,43 . However, the success of such efforts depends on the choice of the linker installation sites, conjugation modality, and payload. Indeed, as we have demonstrated in this and previous reports 29 , our branched linker technology requires both adequate spacers and cleavable mechanisms within the linker scaffold for maximal ADC potency. These components are critical to alleviate the structural congestion and to ensure rapid payload release in an active form from each linker arm. \n\nIn summary, our findings support the conclusion that the EVCit linker technology is a significant contribution to efforts for developing next-generation ADCs and other drug conjugates.",

The ideal linker should maintain stability in the bloodstream since the ADC should not release the cytotoxic drug before reaching its target and thereby cause off-target toxicity. In addition, the linker should readily release the drug after internalization [27]. From the viewpoint of intracellular stability and manner of degradation, linkers are divided as non-cleavable and cleavable [23]. Non-cleavable linkers are generally very stable in body fluids and solely depend on lysosomal degradation to release their payload. In contrast, cleavable linkers have instability under the low pH, protease-enriched environment of lysosomes, or high level of intracellular glutathione [15]. For this reason, cytotoxic substances affect nearby cells regardless of target antigen expression [18].",

Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut). The comparison of the Tab profile with the conjugated antibody profile allows for an assessment of linker stability as shown conceptually in Fig. 5, where the conjugated antibody concentrations for the more unstable linker decline much faster compared to that of the stable linker. \n\nDifferent types of linkers used on the same antibody can impact its pharmacokinetics as illustrated by the following examples. The pharmacokinetics of anti-HER2 ADCs was determined in mice using disulfide linkers with different hindered structures (32). The clearance of the ADC decreased with the increase in the degree of hindrance of the disulfide linker as follows: SPDP-DM1 (least hindered) > SPP-DM1 > SSNPP-DM3 > SSNPP-DM4 (most hindered).",

However, conjugates containing cleavable linkers have been shown to be more effective than the corresponding analogs containing non-cleavable linkers [20,35]. The linker must be carefully selected to remain intact during circulation, and to release the drug at the site of disease. Premature drug release often leads to systemic toxicity, as well as decreased drug efficacy. An example is neutropenia, a commonly reported toxicity in ADCs containing the valine-citruline protease cleavable linker, due to the premature release of the drug and action of the cytotoxic payload in the bone marrow [36]. Another frequently employed cleavable linker is the disulfide bond, which is cleaved under reductive conditions. Tumor cells contain a higher concentration (100-1000\u00d7 fold higher) of glutathione (GSH) compared to the extracellular concentration. GSH is a potent reductive agent, reacting readily with disulfide bonds [37,38]. A GSH stability assay was used to mimic the intracellular release of the cytotoxic payload. We determined that DM1 was fully released from ePSMA-DM1 within 6 h. Compared to other DM1-containing SMDCs, the release of the payload takes longer for our compound, even though the disulfide linker is not sterically hindered [30].\n\nUsing an NAALADase enzymatic assay to evaluate binding to PSMA, we determined that ePSMA-DM1 had an IC 50 value approximately 20-fold worse than the IC 50 value of PSMA-617 (45.3 \u00b1 1.84 nM vs. 2.19 \u00b1 0.78 nM). While both compounds are based on the EuK binding moiety, structural modifications in the linker region and the addition of the drug affected the binding due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions inside the binding pocket of the protein [39,40]. The radiochemical evaluation of ePSMA-DM1 with In-111 and Lu-177 also showed that the compounds were stable in formulation",

            "text": "ADCs were initially expected to have a wide therapeutic window based on the ADC design concept. Although their therapeutic window is indeed wider than that of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and they have made highly toxic payloads druggable, ADCs still have a relatively narrow therapeutic window compared with most mAbs (Figure 1). Toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy and cytopenia may limit the number of dosing cycles that patients can tolerate, resulting in dose delays, dose reductions, or study discontinuations. Widening the therapeutic window remains one of the most important challenges in ADC development. \n\nUnderstanding the key drivers of ADC efficacy and safety is important to further improve ADC design to achieve a better therapeutic window. As shown in Figure 2, 7 the following mechanisms hypothetically contribute to ADC efficacy and safety and thus affect the therapeutic windows. ADC efficacy is hypothetically driven by target-dependent uptake; catabolism of an ADC results in releasing cytotoxic payload inside the tumor cell, which induces tumor cell killing. In addition, the on-target bystander effect may also occur when the cytotoxic payload is cell-permeable, diffusing through the tumor cell and killing neighboring tumor cells. The unwanted toxicity of ADCs may occur through several different mechanisms, namely nonspecific uptake of ADC by normal tissues, on-target and off-tumor toxicity due to target expression in vital normal tissues, and the associated bystander effect for the types of payloads that are cellpermeable. In addition, extracellular deconjugation and release of payload, which is determined by linker stability, may also contribute to the off-target toxicity. \n\nUnderstanding the above key drivers of ADC efficacy and safety is necessary for further improving ADC design and achieving a better therapeutic window. Numerous reviews are available that have covered this topic in significant depth. Briefly, the identification of tumor-specific targets that enable efficient ADC internalization in tumor cells while having minimal expression in normal tissue is important. Linkers should be relatively stable while in systemic circulation but release the payload efficiently once the ADC is internalized into the tumor cells.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now established as an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There are currently seven FDA-approved ADCs, with at least 60 more in clinical development. 1 The success of ADCs arises from the combination of the exquisite cell-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule chemotherapies. However, for the mAb and drug to exert their maximum therapeutic potential, the covalent linker between the two groups must exhibit the following properties: (1) high plasma stability; the long circulatory lifetimes (t 1/2 > 1 week) of ADCs places stringent stability requirements on the linker to avoid off-target payload release. (2) High aqueous solubility to aid bioconjugation of lipophilic payloads and avoid antibody aggregation. (3) Release of a potent cytotoxin from the antibody in the target cell. 2 The majority of ADCs employ antibodies that target internalising antigens, overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon antibody-antigen binding at the target cell, the ADC is endocytosed and trafficked to the highly hydrolytic lysosomal compartments, where the antibody is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 3 In the case of a non-cleavable linker, the active intracellular cytotoxin is released as the linker-payload with the terminal amino acid from the mAb still attached. 4 Conversely, a cleavable linker is designed to release the unmod-i\ue103ed drug at this point, or upon subsequent entry to the cytosol.\n\nCleavable linkers are generally preferred to non-cleavable linkers in ADC research for a number of reasons. 5 First, traceless drug release allows the unmodi\ue103ed payload to perform its intracellular function without an unwanted linker appendage, thereby maximising cytotoxicity. Second, the unmodi\ue103ed payload can be uncharged, allowing it to diffuse into 'bystander' tumour cells that may not be expressing the target antigen. This 'bystander effect' provides an important mechanism for eradicating tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression. 6 Enzyme",

            "text": "A vital component of an ADC is the linker that constitutes the connection between payload and antibody. Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

            "text": "Dose-limiting (DL) hematological toxicities, especially thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, are among the most severe AE commonly reported for the approved ADCs [5,16,65]. These are primarily attributed to Ag-independent off-tumor targeting, which can result from various mechanisms. These can be either non-specific uptake by Fc receptor-expressing cells (e.g., platelets) or via macro-or micro-pinocytosis processes, or eventually, premature payload release into the systemic circulation due to unstable linkers. As a result, highly perfused organs, like the bone marrow, alongside the liver, kidney, spleen, or gastrointestinal tract, with high cell renewal, can be exposed to ADC-induced toxicity, as for standard chemotherapy [2,5,6,16]. \n\nIn some cases, the observed AE seems not correlated with the payload type or MOA, as within-class differences in toxicity profiles have also been described. For instance, auristatin MMAF causes ocular toxicities, while MMAE, which belongs to the same auristatin class, does not. Interestingly, this phenomenon has been reported for MMAF constructs bearing non-cleavable linkers. The charged payload complex that generates upon linker processing cannot diffuse out of the corneal epithelia, unlike the lipophilic MMAE, which is typically released from cleavable linkers. This evidence suggests that certain drug-linker combinations may contribute to specific off-target AE by altering the physicochemical properties of the construct [2,5,6,16]. \n\nOccasionally, regardless of the payload, on-target toxicities can also occur and relate to the healthy tissue expression of the target Ag. Indeed, most clinical and preclinical ADC targets are tumor-associated rather than tumor-selective [2,5,6,16]. However, this is not a \"one-fits-all\" situation, as some ADC targets with appreciable expression in non-malignant tissue, like Trop-2 or HER2, give no AE at those sites. A potential reason may be insufficient Ag expression or its spatial sequestration or distribution on the surface, limiting binding accessibility.",

ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers. However, additional efficacy from bystander effects are not expected with non-cleavable drug conjugates, presumably due to the cell's impermeability to the \"hydrophilic\" drug-linker complex. However, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates was observed .\n\nSome ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed in vivo efficacy that was better than ADCs with cleavable linkers. For example, the anti-CD70-mcMMAF conjugate demonstrated an improved therapeutic index, as a result of higher MTD and antitumor efficacy in various renal cell carcinoma models compared with anti-CD70-vcMMAF conjugates (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Similarly, the thioether-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) conjugate showed improved efficacy, PK, and tolerability compared to the disulfide-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). The thioetherlinked huC242-MCC-DM1 conjugate, however, showed more unfavorable in vivo efficacy in xenograft tumor models than the disulfide-linked huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate, even though the thioether-linked conjugate had improved stability with comparable in vitro efficacy as did the huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate (Tolcher et al., 2003;Kellogg et al., 2011). Therefore, the ultimately achieved therapeutic window of the ADC with non-cleavable linkers will likely be dependent on the biology of the target, the target cells, and the delivery of antibody for subsequent lysosomal degradation.

Among the cleavable linkers, multiples subtypes such as acid labile linkers (e.g., hydrazine linkers), were used to produce the FDA approved Gemtuzumab ozogamicin. These hydrazine linkers are pH sensitive and usually dissociate from mAbs through hydrolysis in lysosome-like microenvironmentsvery acidic-or hypoxic tumor regions [56,93,144]. \n\nOther forms of cleavable linkers include valine-citrulline dipeptides and disulphide linkers, which respectively rely on enzymatic cleavage (e.g., cathepsin B, cysteine protease) under acidic lysosomal conditions and high level of reduced glutathione [31,145]. Conversely to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are inherently stable in plasma with reduced side effects, which favor repeated treatment cycles [31,110]. It then ensues that the type of chemical conjugation of the payloads to ADCs are very critical, as they significantly influence ADC stability, clinical efficacy, DAR and pharmacokinetic behavior [137,146]. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include lysine or cysteine amino acid conjugations, which tend to generate different DARs or necessitate partial cysteine reduction [31,147]. Lately, efforts to improve ADCs homogeneity through site-specific conjugation of mAbs to toxic payloads, have been performed using SNAP-tag technology.",

            "text": "Cytotoxic payloads, which are smallmolecule drugs, are engineered to selectively eliminate tumor cells [30]. Due to the limited bioavailability of ADCs-only approximately 2% reach the target tumor site following intravesical administration-the payload compounds must possess high toxicity, typically with IC50 values in the nM to pM range [18]. The efficacy of an ADC in delivering cytotoxic agents depends on three primary factors: the number of target cell surface antigens available for antibody binding, the internalization efficiency of the antigen-antibody complex, and the release of active cytotoxic agents from the intracellular antigen-antibody complex. Currently, ADC payloads exert their therapeutic effects primarily by disrupting microtubule polymerization and inducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage [31]. This approach emphasizes the targeted and precise mechanism of ADCs in eliminating cancer cells. \n\nLinkers. Cytotoxic payloads in ADCs are conjugated to the antibody via a linker, which must remain stable in vivo to ensure ADC integrity until it reaches the tumor cell. However, this linkage should be easily cleaved upon internalization. Maintaining ADC stability during circulation is essential to prevent premature payload release due to linker degradation, which could cause damage to healthy tissues. Simultaneously, ADCs must be capable of efficiently releasing their cytotoxic payloads once internalized by the target cells. Linkers are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Non-cleavable linkers include two main categories: thioether and maleimidocaproyl [32]. Cleavable linkers are further divided into three types: acid-cleavable, reducible disulfides, and those cleaved by exogenous stimuli [33]. Within the cleavable category, linkers can be potential of pH-sensitive, protease-sensitive, or glutathione-sensitive, based on their specific characteristics [34,35]. Cleavable linkers are designed to break down in response to the distinct conditions of the tumor microenvironment, promoting the release of small molecule payloads.",

            "text": "The linker in ADCs connects the antibody with the cytotoxic drug. It plays a critical role in the stability of ADCs and the release profiles of payloads, consequently influencing the therapeutic index of ADCs. An ideal linker should limit premature payload release in plasma while facilitating the active release of drugs at the desired target sites. Most ADCs employ two types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. The first ones are designed to cleave under specific conditions, such as in a low-pH environment or in the presence of proteolytic enzymes [5]. \n\nThe cytotoxic payload is the active component that exerts cytotoxicity upon the internalization of ADCs into cancer cells. These compounds must remain stable under physiological conditions and possess functional groups suitable for conjugation with the antibody. To date, the cytotoxic payloads utilized in ADCs primarily comprise potent tubulin inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents [8,9]. In this light, the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) represents the average number of payload molecules (ranging from 2 to 8) attached to each monoclonal antibody. While ADCs with higher DARs exhibited greater potency in vitro, preclinical evidence demonstrated that they may have higher toxicity and a lower therapeutic index [10]. \n\nFollowing intravenous injection, ADCs bind to their target antigens and undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization within the cell. Once inside the cell, the cytotoxic payload carries out its cytotoxic role through its interaction with microtubules or DNA. In addition, apoptotic cells or ADCs may release the cytotoxic component into the extracellular space, potentially inducing cell death in neighboring cells, a phenomenon known as the \"bystander effect\" [11]. \n\nThe current review aims to explore the past, the present, and the future of ADCs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of advanced SCLC (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Diverse ADC properties are also impacted by linker chemistry, including specificity, stability, potency, and toxicity [21]. Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

            "text": "Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. \n\nNanomaterials 2021, 11, 1755 15 of 25 binds with a high specificity to the antibody to minimize off-target toxic side effects to healthy cells. The number and density of target antigen molecules on the surface of CSCs affect the extent of the ADC engulfment by tumor cells. Further, antigen secretion by the CSCs to the circulation should be minimal to limit the circulatory detection of the ADCantigen and activation of the immune system. Table 1 summarizes the list of surface antigens on tumor cells used in designing antibody-drug conjugates for different types of cancers [104,106]. Another factor is the selection of an antibody to target the antigens on the surface of CSCs with a high specificity, strong binding affinity, and long circulation half-life for prolonged uptake and retention by the tumor tissue. The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107].",

            "text": "The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107]. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADC is affected by the choice of linker that connects the antibody to the drug molecule. The linker should stabilize the ADC in circulation but provide a mechanism for the release of the payload when the ADC reaches the tumor site. Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. ADCs possess a higher tumor selectivity and cytotoxicity, compared to other targeted delivery approaches [103]. In a recent study, natural phospholipids were mixed with PTX and SLM conjugated to monoclonal antibody 2C5 to form PTX/SLM-ADC immunoliposomes for targeted delivery to bulk tumor cells and CSCs in TNBC. The in vitro studies with MDA-MB-231 TNBCs and HER2-positive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells showed a specific uptake of PTX-ADC and SLM-ADC by bulk tumor cells and CSCs, respectively [109].",

            "text": "Key examples of toxicities include the expression of HER2 and Nectin-2 on cardiomyocytes and skin, causing cardiotoxicity and skin toxicity, respectively [107]. Due to the unique makeup of different ADCs, adverse effect profiles vary and may be unique to the ADC, highlighting the importance of being able to provide reference guides for the individual drugs [108]. Early in ADC development, premature release of ADC payloads causing higher toxicity was associated with linker instability. To reduce this, the half-life of the ADC needed to be 10 times that of the payload itself [109]. Another key parameter to minimise premature drug release and toxicity is the polarity of the linker. This balance enhances payload coupling and reduces immunogenicity, while maintaining an appropriate payload delivery [110,111]. If the cytotoxic agent is too hydrophobic, this can change the antibody properties, leading to aggregation or conjugation. These balances can influence drug efficacy and tolerability [55]. Neutropaenia is a common and important toxicity of ADCs, particularly of MMAE-based ADCs with valine-citrulline linkers. With ADCs that contain a valine-citrulline linker and MMAE payload, neutropaenia occurs because neutrophils in the bone marrow produce serine proteases, which subsequently cleave the valine-citrulline linker and lead to the premature extracellular release of MMAE, and neutrophil death [112]. Another potential limitation of ADCs is in cancers that possess a dense tumour stroma. High-molecular weight drugs, including ADCs, have limited ability to penetrate dense tumour stroma to reach the required target [51].",

            "text": "Noncleavable linkers have the characteristic that following ADC lysosomal degradation the cytotoxic payload remains active while still being attached to the linker and an amino acid residue. T-DM1 is an ADC that uses a non-cleavable linker (Junttila et al, 2011;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). \n\nCleavable linkers use different methods to release cytotoxic drug, increasing the possibility of the bystander effect. There are acidsensitive linkers that will release the free drug in the low pH conditions in lysosomes or endosomes. Such a mechanism was used by gemtuzumab ozogamicin and its linker was characterised by certain plasma instability (Hamann et al, 2002;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). Inotuzumab ozogamicin, now in phase II trials, uses the same linker and it is more stable (Boghaert et al, 2008). Another type of cleavable linker are lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers with the licensed example of brentuximab vedotin (Senter and Sievers, 2012). A third type are glutathione-sensitive linkers that benefit from the higher concentration of glutathione in tumour cells. (Sapra et al, 2011). Each approach has different advantages and disadvantages, so the choice of the linker can only be determined by taking into account all the other components of the ADC. \n\nCytotoxic payload. To create an effective ADC, it is imperative to have a potent cytotoxic payload. The first generation of ADCs used classical chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin and methotrexate with the benefit of a well-known toxicity profile (Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). Repeated studies, however, have shown that the actual concentration of the cytotoxic payload in tumour cells is minimal with only 1-2% of the administered dose reaching the tumour (Teicher and Chari, 2011).",

The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have nonreducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. General basic structure of an ADC. An ADC consists of a chimeric or humanized (less immunogenic) antibody that has strong binding activity to an antigen expressed on the surface of a lymphoma cancer cell. Antibodies should have a higher half-life in circulation to be delivered to the target cell surface. Antibodies are linked to payloads of different structures (mainly, tubulin inhibitors or DNA interacting), which are highly effective drugs with ideal drug/antibody ratio. The linkage between the antibody and payload is through cleavable or non-cleavable linkers, which should have precise binding, stability in circulation, and ensure efficient payload distribution at their targets.

            "text": "For example, the review discussed eight different ADCs under clinical development that incorporated the same vc-MMAE linker-payload composition. Each MMAE ADC was advanced to Phase II clinical investigation at a very similar dose (i.e., within the narrow range of 1.8 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg). All eight MMAE ADCs demonstrated similar DLTs (severe bone marrow toxicity, sepsis, and severe motor neuropathy). This same toxicity profile is shown for all FDA-approved vc-MMAE ADCs, including polatuzumab vedotin [19], enfortumab vedotin [20], and tisotumab vedotin [21]. Similarly, in a review of clinical ADC data published between 2010 and 2014, Masters et al. found that the prevalent grade 3/4 toxicities associated ADCs were consistent with their payload class [12]. For instance, severe anemia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy were commonly reported for MMAE ADCs. For DM1 ADCs, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and hepatic toxicity are typically observed, and severe ocular toxicity is consistently reported for MMAF and DM4 ADCs. Recently, Saber and Leighton performed a follow-up analysis of 15 IND applications for ADCs containing PBD-dimer payloads submitted between 2013 and 2017. They found that the toxicity profiles of the PBD-ADCs were highly comparable, with common adverse events including vascular leak syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal events, metabolic effects, musculoskeletal events, neuropathy, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and kidney injury [22]. The observations found in these studies were consistent with the findings from a recent systemic review and meta-analysis conducted by Zhu et. al. on common and severe treatment-related adverse events associated with ADCs in clinical trials between 2000 and 2022 [23].",

An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (40). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (40). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (65). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (66). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted.",

            "text": "linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5). Indeed, the only marketed ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has an acid-cleavable linker (28). We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that, indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release as well as differing properties of the metabolites.\n\nAlthough cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the same target can sometimes",

Cleavable linkers are used in combination with payloads being only fully active after lysosomal degradation (e.g., MMAE or calicheamicin) [38]. To prevent the cleavage of the linker in blood circulation resulting in unspecific cytotoxicity, the ADC linker has to be stable until the ADC reaches its target cell. To this end, cleavable linkers are usually sensitive to conditions specifically found in lysosomes (e.g., acidic condition or lysosomic proteases (cathepsin B, glycosidase, phosphatase)) or high intracellular glutathione concentrations [38] and thereby release the payload only after endocytosis is achieved, leading to death of the target cell [38] (Figure 2). \n\nRegarding non-cleavable linkers, the drug is active after internalization and enzymatic digestion of the antibody into the lysosome, allowing the release of an active metabolite, amino acid-linker-drug complex (e.g., trastuzumab emtansine) [7]. Non-cleavable linkers allow increased ADC stability, leading to reduced toxicity in non-target tissues [7]. Payloads such as MMAF or DM1 are classically used in this setting.",

DM1 was coupled to the lysine residue of trastuzumab via a non-cleavable linker, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [21]. Since the linker was non-cleavable, T-DM1 could turn to an active state only by digestion in the lysosome after internalization. T-DM1 was an effective drug for HER2-positive breast cancer; hence, it was approved by the FDA in 2013 [22]. Linker improvements in second-generation ADCs achieved better plasma stability and harmonized DAR distribution. The cytotoxicity and coupling of payloads in second-generation ADCs were also improved, and the increase of payloads' water solubility reduced the occurrence of antibody aggregation. \n\nIn addition, some of the second-generation ADCs utilized cleavable linkers, such as Adcetris and Polivy for lymphoma treatment [23,24]. These ADCs with cleavable linkers can cause a bystander effect in vivo, referring to the phenomenon that payloads can be released and kill surrounding cells. Despite the considerable safety advances of secondgeneration ADCs, the shadow therapeutic window due to off-target toxicity is still a challenge for ADCs [25].",

Linkers are classified as cleavable and non-cleavable based on their cleavage mechanisms 20,21 , and are important for the eventual therapeutic index of the ADC 20 . Cleavable linkers are designed to break down and release the cytotoxic payload of the ADC in response to factors associated with the tumor; thus, by using the disparities between tumor cells and the systemic circulation, the payload is released in a guided, precise way. Cleavable linkers are divided into two classes, chemical (which include disulfide and hydrazone bond) and enzyme linkers (peptide and glucuronide bond) 20 . Hydrazone is a pH-sensitive linker, which allows for the ADC to remain stable in the systemic circulation and is hydrolyzed at specific pH (e.g., pH 4.8 induces release of the payload in lysosomes 20,22 . The degradation of cleavable linkers, therefore, can vary depending on a number of specific features, either outside or inside the target cell, such as external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulfide linkers) 23 . Recent cleavable linkers (e.g., enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)) 21 are stable in the systemic circulation, in contrast to non-cleavable linkers, e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1). Non-cleavable linkers, meanwhile, are comprised of stable bonds which are more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in blood; following the internalization of ADCs by lysosomes or proteases, and subsequent antibody degradation, cleavage then occurs which then leads to release of the payload 23 .",

In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

The linker should be sufficiently stable in circulation to allow the payload to remain attached to the antibody while in circulation as it distributes into tissues (including solid tumor tissue), yet should allow efficient release of an active cell-killing agent once the ADC is taken up into the cancer cells [5]. Linkers can be characterized as either cleavable, where a chemical bond (or bonds) between the payload and the attachment site on the antibody (usually an amino acid) can be cleaved intracellularly [16][17][18], or as non-cleavable, where the final active metabolite released within the cell includes the payload and all elements of the linker still attached to an amino acid residue of the antibody, typically a lysine or a cysteine residue, following complete proteolytic degradation of the ADC within the lysosome of the cell [19][20][21]. \n\nThe design goal for an ADC is to harness the potent tumor cell-killing action of the payload to an antibody, while retaining the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of the immunoglobulin, as well as any intrinsic biologic or immunologic activity it may have [5-7, 21, 22]. Much of the selection of the optimal antibody, the ideal linker-payload chemistry, and the optimal number of payload molecules linked per antibody molecule, are determined empirically, with a focus on maximizing the therapeutic index of the ADC [5,22].",

Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

Two main types of linkers exist: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, while cleavable linkers include chemically unstable and enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, chemically unstable linkers can undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of tumors to release drugs efficiently, but their stability in the blood circulation is relatively poor, which usually leads to premature drug delivery [73,81,82]. The emergence of enzyme-sensitive linkers has solved this problem by improving stability and delivery efficiency through specific cleavage using specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors [83,84]. Non-cleavable linkers release the drug by enzymatic complete degradation within the lysosome, which has the advantage of high stability and low off-target toxicity, but their low release efficiency and inability to produce a bystander effect need to be optimized by optimizing the payload structure to improve the efficacy [85].",

Unsurprisingly, both resistant cell lines were found to have decreased linker-payload metabolites compared to the parent cells, although it is uncertain whether this is driven by decreased HER2 expression, decreased ADC processing, or both [28]. In line with the notion that payload release may involve different ADC trafficking requirements depending on the linker status, a recent study using CRISPR screening demonstrated that cleavable linker ADCs are rapidly processed immediately after ADC uptake and trafficked into the early endosome, while non-cleavable linker ADCs require further lysosomal delivery to successfully release the payload. Additional targeted library screening identified that the depletion of sialic acids sensitizes cells to ADC toxicity by boosting ADC lysosomal delivery, potentially by reducing ADC recycling [40].",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers have also proven to be very potent. The release mechanism is believed to occur via internalization of the ADC, followed by the degradation in the lysosome, resulting in the release of the drug while still attached to the linker. As such, when the payloads could maintain the antitumor effects even if being chemically modified, the non-cleavable linker is a good choice. \n\nEarly studies that described non-cleavable linkers were aimed at amine-to-thiol coupling. One advantage of these linkers is their greater stability in the circulation compared with cleavable linkers, which can potentially improve the therapeutic index because it may be better tolerated. Senter found that MMAF, conjugated to a MAb via a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker (cAC10-L4-MMAF), was approximately as potent as when conjugated via a cleavable peptidic linker (cAC10-L1-MMAF) against a large panel of cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at a dose more than three times higher than the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. The half-lives of such non-cleavable linkers in circulation are much longer than those of earlier-generation cleavable linkers (Figure 8). Nearly all animals that received single ADC injections at 2 mg antibody component/kg body weight were cured. When lowering the dose to 1 mg/kg, there were two of six and three of six animals cured by cAC10-L1-MMAF4 and cAC10-L4-MMAF4 ADCs, respectively [81,82]. \n\nThe structural formulas of cAC10-L1-MMAF and cAC10-L4-MMAF.

            "text": "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

DM1 was coupled to the lysine residue of trastuzumab via a non-cleavable linker, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [21]. Since the linker was non-cleavable, T-DM1 could turn to an active state only by digestion in the lysosome after internalization. T-DM1 was an effective drug for HER2-positive breast cancer; hence, it was approved by the FDA in 2013 [22]. Linker improvements in second-generation ADCs achieved better plasma stability and harmonized DAR distribution. The cytotoxicity and coupling of payloads in second-generation ADCs were also improved, and the increase of payloads' water solubility reduced the occurrence of antibody aggregation. \n\nIn addition, some of the second-generation ADCs utilized cleavable linkers, such as Adcetris and Polivy for lymphoma treatment [23,24]. These ADCs with cleavable linkers can cause a bystander effect in vivo, referring to the phenomenon that payloads can be released and kill surrounding cells. Despite the considerable safety advances of second-generation ADCs, the shadow therapeutic window due to off-target toxicity is still a challenge for ADCs [25].",

            "text": "It is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis. In most cases, it may be expected that the payload is eliminated from the body by a clearance (CL) process such as renal filtration, biliary excretion, or hepatic biotransformation, where the pathway of elimination and the efficiency of the free payload CL is not influenced by the site of the payload release (i.e., within plasma due to premature linker hydrolysis, or within targeted or non-targeted cells following endocytosis). The fundamental pharmacokinetic theory predicts that the cumulative exposure to the released payload in plasma (e.g., as measured by the cumulative area under the free payload plasma concentration v. time curve, AUC) is a simple function of the ADC or payload dose and the payload CL (i.e., AUC = dose/CL). As such, poor linker stability is unlikely to influence payload AUC in plasma. However, poor linker stability is expected to decrease the ratio of payload exposure in targeted sites relative to plasma, such that poor linker stability is expected to decrease the ratio of on-site to off-site ADC cytotoxicity (decreasing efficacy relative to toxicity). With the recent advancement of linker technology, several ADCs have been developed using cleavable linkers with substantially improved stability (i.e., relative to those employed in first-generation ADCs, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Yet, they still face the challenge of non-selective payload deconjugation in circulation due to the susceptibility of the linkers to plasma proteases for peptide-based linkers, to plasma reactive thiols for disulfide-based and maleimide-based linkers, or to serum esterases for alkyl carbamate linkers [27][28][29][30].",

If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity. Tandem cleavable linkers are novel linkers that incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety and require tandem enzymic cleavage events (47). These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

For maximum clinical efficacy, they should be chosen in conjunction with the payload and antibody [32]. The point at which the payload is offloaded is determined by the linker design (deconjugated). The selection of coupling chemistry and linker has an impact on the DAR of an ADC. Cleavable linkers comprise motifs that are susceptible to enzymatic cleavage by proteases, hydrolysis at acidic pH, or redox processes taking place in lysosomes or early or late endosomes. Lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody backbone is required for non-cleavable linkers to liberate the payload, as is the case with succinimidyl 4-N-maleimidocaproyl, which is utilized in T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine). The electric charge and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the payload may thus be influenced by linkers [33]. This has two consequences, one of which is to impair the capacity of the payload to diffuse across membranes, thereby avoiding or inducing a bystander effect on adjacent cells that do not express the antigen. As a result, intracellular concentrations of the payload may be altered, and primary or acquired drug resistance may develop. While existing linkers in clinical trials are specifically engineered to facilitate the internalization of ADCs, efforts are underway to develop new linkers that are designed to target ADCs that do not require internalization [34].",

            "text": "The linker is a key component of ADCs because it affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) aspects, such as drug stability into the bloodstream, tumor cell permeability, the number of payload molecules carried by each Ab (i.e., drug-to-Ab ratio, DAR) and the extent of the bystander effect. The main role of a linker is to connect the Ab to the payload, while the drug circulates in the bloodstream [16]. If linkers are unstable in plasma, the payload may be released prematurely, with consequent challenging systemic toxicity and reduced payload delivery at the tumor site [17]. Of note, numerous ADCs carry potent cytotoxic warheads, with toxicity profiles unsuitable for systemic delivery [3]. Another important role of the linker is to ensure an adequate release of the payload within tumor cells [3,18]. \n\nLinkers typically consist of two classes: cleavable and non-cleavable [3]. Cleavable linkers break down in cancer cells and release the payload in response to environmental factors, such as pH (acid-labile linkers), reduction-oxidation conditions (disulfide linkers) or proteolytic enzymes (protease-cleavable linkers). Although cleavable linkers show overall stability into the bloodstream, they may decay in plasma over time [17]. Conversely, noncleavable linkers consist of stable bonds in plasma and resistance to proteolytic degradation, so that the payload is released upon cleavage relying on lysosomal degradation of the entire Ab-linker complex [9,17]. Lower membrane permeability may affect these type of linkers [9].",

Non-cleavable linkers tend to be more stable than their cleavable counterparts, but they rely on lysosomal degradation of the entire antibody-linker construct for payload release.

In human plasma, Kadcyla \u00ae catabolites, MCC-DM1, lysine-bound emtansine (Lys-MCC-DM1), and DM1 have been detected at low levels. Cytotoxic effects of Kadcyla \u00ae result from DM1-containing catabolites (primarily Lys-MCC-DM1) binding to tubulin, which disrupts microtubule networks, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death at sub-nanomolar concentrations [72]. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that Kadcyla \u00ae mediates ADCC [69]. \n\nUndoubtedly, the approval of Kadcyla \u00ae in 2013 was a big win for Swiss drug maker, Roche.

This six-fold increase in potency can be explained by the traceless release of MMAE, compared with the modi\ue103ed MMAEmetabolite released from non-cleavable ADC 4, whose tubulin-binding activity is expected to be lower. Gratifyingly, arylsulfatecontaining ADC 2 and ADC 3 compared similarly with the dipeptidic ADC 5; both were also 5-10 times more cytotoxic than non-cleavable ADC 4 (Fig. 6a). The similar performance of these arylsulfate-and dipeptide-ADCs suggests that the arylsulfate linkers are also being cleaved in the cells following ADC internalisation. Contrastingly, ADC 1 was non-toxic across both HER2positive cell lines, demonstrating that ortho-amide containing arylsulfate linkers are unsuitable for ADCs. The complete lack of cytotoxicity indicates that the in vitro sulfatase cleavage of ADC 1 is occurring at an insufficient rate and the maintained presence of the anionic sulfate group adjacent to the auristatin payload inhibits its tubulin-binding ability.\n\nAll \ue103ve ADCs were non-toxic towards the HER2-negative MCF7 cells up to 3 nM, validating the stability of the linkers in media and the retained functionality of the mAb to bind and internalise with the HER2 antigen (Fig. 6b).

            "text": "Yet, they still face the challenge of non-selective payload deconjugation in circulation due to the susceptibility of the linkers to plasma proteases for peptide-based linkers, to plasma reactive thiols for disulfide-based and maleimide-based linkers, or to serum esterases for alkyl carbamate linkers [27][28][29][30]. \n\nIn contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin [25]. These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes [31]. Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy [32]. This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment [33]. ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization [32]. Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

They are generally stable in the blood, but speedy lysate in low pH and protease-rich lysosomal environments and release effector molecules. In addition, if effector molecules can cross membranes, tumors can be eliminated through the potential bystander effect.

Schematic of ADC components and their role in ADC design, engineering and functions. The Fab region (A) is responsible for antigen recognition and binding, and can lead to ADC internalization. Therefore, the Fab region needs to be targeted to tumor-associated antigens that are homogenously expressed on tumor cells, ideally with little or no expression on normal cells. The payload is attached to the antibody via a cleavable or non-cleavable linker (B). Non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete degradation of the antibody after internalization of the ADC, whereas most cleavable linkers are cleaved by different mechanisms depending on the linker (i.e. proteases, reduction) and some cleavable linkers do not depend on ADC internalization for payload release and can result in higher off-target cytotoxicities. The hydrophobicity of linkers can play a vital role in the biodistribution of an ADC. Linkers can be attached non-selectively via lysines or the hinge thiols of cysteines, or antibody engineering can be performed for site-specific linking. The payload (C) is responsible for ADC toxicity and is usually a small hydrophobic molecule, able to cross cell membranes and cause cell death by targeting the cytoskeleton or DNA. Once cleaved from the antibody payloads can enter other (tumor) cells, resulting in further tumor killing (i.e. bystander effect) as well as off-target cytotoxicity when",

            "text": "The primary emphases of linker design for ADCs are the ability to cleave active drug from the ADCs into the targeted cancer cell and the ability to remain stable in systemic circulation. The early ADCs (3-4) with an acid labile hydrazine bond were designed to release the active drug into the target cells using the acidic environment of the endosomes and lysosomes. Efficient release of cytotoxic agents was demonstrated in acidic buffer, but studies of ADC incubation under physiological conditions reported slow release of the agents. 42) Because release of drug in circulation could lead to systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index owing to degradation of the ADCs, it was thought that an effective linker design has to balance the necessity of better stability in circulation and efficient cleavage in the target cell. GO (5) consists of calicheamicin linked to the antibody via 4-(4\u2032-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid (AcBut) linker as a hydrazone bond linker. 19) The AcBut linker was carefully chosen after screening a set hybrid linkers with good stability at pH 7.4 and almost complete hydrolysis at pH 4.5 at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. 43) GN-35 ( 7) contains a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide and self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbamoyl (pABC) linker. 27) The dipeptide (valine-citrulline) is recognized by cathepsins (such as cathepsin B) which are enhanced in tumors. 44,45) Thus, this dipeptide was stable in circulation until it reached tumor cells and the payload was selectively released into tumor cells. Moreover, MMAE itself was released by 1,6-elimination and decarboxylation of self-immolative pABC, and exerted an antitumor effect. \n\nIn contrast, T-DM1 (8) adopted a non-cleavable linker not triggered by a drug-release mechanism to achieve greater stability in systemic circulation. 33)",

However, non-cleavable ADC 4, which lacks a cathepsin-cleavable sequence within the linker scaffold, showed 1.8-4.2-fold higher EC 50 values than those of cleavable ADC 3a (Fig. 3c, d, Supplementary Fig. 11, and Supplementary Table 3). These results suggest that existence of a cleavage mechanism is a key to maximize cell killing potency of ADCs constructed using our branched linker platform. \n\nValidation of ADCs in vivo. Finally, we evaluated the ADCs in vivo using mouse models. We first assessed PK profiles of VCit, SVCit, and EVCit ADCs 3a-c using BALB/c mice. Mice were treated with intravenous injection of each ADC or the parental N297A anti-HER2 mAb (3 mg kg -1 ). Blood was collected periodically via the tail vein. Concentrations of total mAb (both conjugated and unconjugated) and intact ADC (conjugated only) in blood were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig. 12, and Supplementary Table 5). All ADCs showed similar clearance rates as that of the parental mAb (t 1/2\u03b2 = 14.9 days), indicating that installing glutamic acid or serine at the P 3 position did not negatively impact the clearance profile (Fig. 4a). As expected, EVCit ADC 3c showed no significant loss of payload caused by cleavage in circulation (t 1/2\u03b2 = 12.0 days). In contrast, VCit and SVCit ADCs 3a, b quickly lost MMAF (t 1/2\u03b2 = 2.0 days and 2.4 days, respectively), demonstrating that the VCit and SVCit sequences installed on the mAb-branched linker system were unstable in circulation.",

            "text": "Currently, the number of survivors for cancer patients is increasing due to the rapid development of novel anticancer therapies. Although the mechanism of antitumor action of chemotherapy drugs is clear, the mechanism leading to peripheral neuropathy may differ, leading to the unpredictability of peripheral neuropathy occurrence and development. The occurrence, severity, and duration of symptoms vary widely among individuals. To achieve better, comprehensive, and satisfactory efficacy, further in-depth and extensive exploration is necessary, and there is still a long path ahead in this area of research. \n\nOne especially attractive route might be the improvement of ADC technology to reduce the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy associated with ADC therapy. Traditional ADCs often utilize random conjugation methods, which can result in heterogeneous mixtures with varying drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR). However, site-specific conjugation techniques, such as enzymatic conjugation or site-specific bioconjugation, were recently developed to allow for precise and controlled drug attachment to specific sites on the antibody. 126 It can enhance ADC stability, improve pharmacokinetics, and reduce off-target toxicity, potentially minimizing peripheral neuropathy. For instance, Matsuda et al. have developed a site-specific chemical conjugation method using IgG Fc-afinity reagents. 127 It could significantly expand the therapeutic index of ADC compared to stochastic conjugation methods. Through site-specific conjugation technology, Pavel Strop et al. generate several highly loaded ADCs that exhibited good safety profiles with higher exposure in comparison to the conventional conjugates. 128 Moreover, payload diversification is expected to play a key role for reducing the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Since MMAE is the main driver for ADC-induced peripheral neuropathy, the development of novel and potent cytotoxins (such as pyrrolobenzodiazepine monomers/dimers, indolino-benzodiazepines or cyclopropabenzindolone monomers/dimers) as the ADC payloads would be effective to mitigate the side effects of peripheral neuropathy. 129",

However, low levels of glutathione is also present within the circulation (2.8\u02d80.9 \u00b5M) [23]. Increasing levels of disulphide steric hindrance through the insertion of methyl groups has proportionally reduced their untimely release within the circulation [24]. Lorvotuzumab mertansine (IMGN901) is the most clinically advanced ADC employing a hindered disulphide linker. This anti-CD56 targeting ADC with a maytanisinoid (DM1) payload has shown efficacy against Merkel cell carcinoma in early phase trials and has been granted orphan status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [25].\n\nThe second class of ADC linking strategies involves the use of non-cleavable thioether linkers that require the post-internalisation degradation of the ADC complex within the lysosomal and endosomal compartments. This disintegration results in the release of a cytotoxic agent still attached with the linker and an amino acid from the original antibody attachment site [26]. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has successfully used a non-cleavable linker to combine a maytansinoids toxic to the anti-HER2 trastuzumab antibody [27]. Non-cleavable linkers have improved stability in the bloodstream, longer half-lives, and hence reduced risk of off-target toxicity [28]. T-DM1, for example, has a serum stability of more than three days [29]. The success of each linking strategy is context-dependent, with advantages and disadvantages for each. The conjugation method used to combine the linker to exposed residues on the surface of antibody is another pivotal step in the manufacture of a successful ADC.",

            "text": "Notably, the linker molecule is an essential factor related to ADC's specificity, stability, safety, and overall therapeutic index. Its ultimate role is to bridge the Ab with the cytotoxic drug with characteristics to avoid ADC's aggregation and early release of cytotoxic payloads in plasma, ensuring its release specifically at the targeted site [78]. They are developed to enhance their stability in the circulatory system for an extended period and effectively deliver the cytotoxic payload to the desired site. The linkers are generally divided into two categories named cleavable linkers that can release the cytotoxic payloads into the target cell's cytosol in the presence of specific environmental factors such as hydrazine linkers used in Gemtuzumab and ozogamicin release the cytotoxic drug in reaction to the acidic endosomes and lysosomes [79]. They can also be cleaved when reducing agents, and proteases are present, for example, the presence of cathepsin B presence or glutathione release in considerable amounts. Non-cleavable linkers rely on the breakdown of mAbs with the help of enzymatic hydrolysis activity of proteases to deliver the linker-payload complex component of ADC as they are invulnerable to proteolytic degradation. They are more often preferred than cleavable linkers due to the improved stability and additionally, they perform considerably better in vivo, with early payload release, according to studies and hence less likely to result in systemic toxicity because cleavage of both the mAb and the linker primarily takes place in the lysosome after internalization [80,81]. In RA-affected tissues, macrophages and neutrophils are present extensively leading to high protease activity. That means cleavable linkers specifically those sensitive to proteases (Valine-Citrulline peptide linker) or acidic environment (hydrazone) can be utilized for ADC synthesis.",

Endocytosis, lysosomal function, and medication efflux pumps are also linked to resistance. The development of novel cytotoxic agents and the innovation of linkers and conjugation technology will help to break through the competition of ADCs. \n\nIdentifying additional agents that can generate \"immunesynergy\" has been a major focus since the initial successes of ICIs. Some ADCs payloads can induce ICDs.

            "text": "The average DAR is calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated payload vs. total antibody, and the change of average DAR could indicate ADC deconjugation in vivo [94]. However, a highly specific immunoaffinity enrichment is commonly required to isolate free payload with conjugated ADCs, which not only is feasible in many projects, but also impedes conjugated payload quantification in tissue samples. An alternative and simpler method is using protein precipitation followed by on-pellet linker cleavage [91]. \n\nBy comparison, given the inherent feature of non-cleavable linker, payloads conjugated by non-cleavable linkers are often indirectly determined by multiplying in vivo average DAR measure using intact LC-MS with total antibody concentration [57]. That being said, direct quantification of small-molecule forms of payloads conjugated with non-cleavable linkers has recently been explored, where the target analytes are payload-linker-amino-acids or payload-linker-peptides after extensive or site-specific digestion [93]. Such attempts are currently limited to ADCs with site-specific conjugation. Hyung et al. [126] developed an LC-MS method for quantification of conjugated payload of an engineered, cysteineconjugated ADC with non-cleavable linkers in plasma sample. After a rough enrichment using protein A, the ADC was subjected to tryptic digestion, which produced a unique peptide-linker-payload moiety for quantification. In another case, an ADC that contained maytansinoid tubulin inhibitor DM1 conjugated to engineered cysteine residues through a tri-glycine-containing peptide linker (CX1) was investigated [127]. A tryptic peptide containing cystinelinker-payload was selected as the surrogate for quantification of the conjugated payload.",

Thus, the linker is crucial for a perfect ADC, and it determines the stability, efficacy, and even the ability to overcome MDR. The basic requirement of the linker is to make the payload attach to the antibody, stabilize the payload in the circulation system, and is labile to release the free payload into cancer cells when the antigen-antibody complex is formed (Doronina et al., 2006).

On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic payload after an ADC has been internalized by the cell [21]. In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration.",

            "text": "The linker plays a crucial role since its properties greatly influence the ADC's pharmacokinetics, therapeutic index and efficacy (Hughes, 2010;Flygare et al, 2013;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). The ideal linker should be stable so that the ADC does not release the cytotoxic drug before reaching its target and causing off-target toxicity. At the same time it should be able to release the drug efficiently once internalised (Teicher and Chari, 2011). \n\nAnother important factor is how many of the drug molecules will be loaded onto the antibody: the drug-antibody ratio (DAR). Attaching too few of the drug molecules will lead to decreased efficacy. Attach too many and the ADC will become unstable with altered pharmacokinetic properties, increased plasma clearance, reduced half-life and increased systemic toxicity (Perez et al, 2014). The currently licensed ADCs with proven activity are produced by nonspecific conjugation to lysine residues and to some degree consist of an undesirable heterogeneous mixture of ADCs containing drug molecules with high There are ongoing efforts for more homogeneous ADCs with increased number of drug molecules stably linked to the Ab. The optimal DAR is undetermined and highly dependent on other ADC variables; however, more commonly the ADCs aim to attain a DAR close to 4. (Hamblett et al, 2004;Teicher and Chari, 2011). Site-specific conjugation, has been an important step in ADC development, enabled the production of homogeneous ADCs with the desired and prespecified DAR by using techniques such as engineered cysteine residue, non-canonical amino acid incorporation or modification of peptide tags (Panowksi et al, 2014;Agarwal and Bertozzi, 2015). Linkers can be divided in non-cleavable and cleavable. Noncleavable linkers have the characteristic that following ADC lysosomal degradation the cytotoxic payload remains active while still being attached to the linker and an amino acid residue.",

Herein, ADCs with tubulin-binding payloads were associated with PN and exhibited diverse characteristics. \n\nMost ADC-induced AEs can be attributed to the payload 13 . ADCs with the same class of linkers/payloads typically exhibit similar toxicity profiles and maximum tolerated doses, irrespective of the target antigen and the level of antigen expression in healthy tissues 14 . The prevalence of ADC-induced grade 3/4 toxicities is consistent with their payload class, as demonstrated by a review discussing clinical ADC data 15 . After ADC dosing, the released payload quickly enters systemic circulation, where premature deconjugation of the payload results in plasma exposure to the free payload (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) 16. It is estimated that only 0.1% of the injected ADC dose reaches the intended diseased cell population, whereas the majority of the administered dose is metabolized \"off-site\" within non-targeted healthy cells, resulting in unintended toxicity 17,18 . Lipophilic payloads have high permeability across plasma membranes, resulting in payload release into non-targeted cells, which could lead to unwanted cytotoxicity. Over 80% of approved ADCs possess lipophilic and cleavable linkers 19 . In addition to the released payload entering non-targeted cells through passive diffusion across plasma membranes, non-specific endocytosis of intact ADC may contribute to the off-site payload delivery 20 . \n\nBecause small-molecule payloads typically employ the same mechanism of action as traditional anticancer chemotherapy agents following release from a monoclonal antibody, the payload can induce the same typical chemotherapy-related toxicities, including hematologic and non-hematologic AEs 15  www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

Given that the hybrid nature of ADCs includes a small molecule component, it is conceivable that some of common ADCassociated toxicities may be due to the small molecule component and not due to the antibody or linker components [2,12]. The analysis performed on approved ADC therapeutics indicated that many of the doselimiting toxicities, including bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity and neuropathy, are related to the small molecule component [1,13]. Better understanding of these mechanisms of antigen-dependent and/or -independent cytotoxicities induced by ADCs is warranted for future ADC development strategies.",

            "text": "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

The improved integrity and stability of ADC indicates higher anti-tumor efficacy and better pharmacokinetics [17,35], which will be further evaluated in vivo using xenografts mouse model in future. \n\nThe comparison between our study and reported data was summarized in Table 2. It is clear that the ADCs that were prepared with the optimized process showed high anti-cancer toxicity and the IC 50 values were similar to previous publications, but the viability of cancer cells post treatment was lower than most reported data, indicating a better cytotoxicity. In addition, the anti-cancer toxicity was affected by ADC preparation process, targeted cell line, treatment timeline, detection assay, etc.",

            "text": "There are two types of linkers, cleavable and noncleavable. An appropriate linker is not only required to prevent degradation during systemic circulation but also to facilitate the quick and efficient release of the drug inside the tumor cells [35]. Non-cleavable linkers release their conjugated drug only after antibody degradation. For example, for Kadcyla which has a non-cleavable thioether linker, lysosomal membrane proteins are required to first transport the drug catabolite out of the lysosomal compartment & then exert a therapeutic effect [36]. Barok et al. [37] established that non-cleavable linkers are more susceptible to ADC resistance in tumor cells because any faulty linker degradation will not lead to functional drug release. \n\nBV is composed of protease-cleavable valine-citrulline peptide, where the MMAE does not depend on the degradation of the antibody backbone. Thus, it leads to much faster payload release after ADC internalization compared to a non-cleavable linker [38]. However, a faulty linker cleaving or non-cleaving can lead to an ineffective payload discharge. As per a study conducted by Caculitan et al. [39], valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker showed broad-spectrum specificity to different types of cathepsins, including cathepsin B, cathepsin L, cathepsin K, etc. [39]. Since only cathepsin B is postulated to be highly expressed in HL cells, and normal cells have other kinds of cathepsins, this phenomenon could be very deleterious as it would induce toxic side effects on other normal cells [40]. \n\nA defective linker thereby affects the cytotoxic drug delivery in many ways from the drug not reaching the target, to off-target toxicity and the drug not being able to dissociate from the mAb and the linker, thereby overall promoting resistance.

Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]. Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42]. \n\nases, such as cathepsin B, which are overexpressed in several cancer cell types [45].

            "text": "There have also been studies that use mathematical modeling to characterize the systemic PK of MMAE-conjugated ADCs. Chen et al. built a minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict drug-drug interactions for MMAE-conjugated ADCs in humans [9]. The population PK modeling approach has also been employed to investigate the PK variability of brentuximab vedotin in adults [10] and pediatrics [11]. However, these models did not serve the purpose of predicting the whole-body distribution of MMAE. On the other hand, the vc-cleavable-linker is commonly used for MMAE-conjugated ADCs, which is different from the non-cleavable linker used in Adotrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) [12]. Once MMAE-conjugated ADC is internalized, the vc-linker can be cleaved by protease in the lysosome, and free MMAE is released to the systemic circulation. As such, the PK of unconjugated MMAE behaves the same as MMAE administrated in the free form. Therefore, the development of a PBPK model for free MMAE can be useful to characterize the PK of unconjugated MMAE following the administration of MMAE-conjugated ADCs, and for the development of exposure-response relationships to predict the toxicity of these ADCs. \n\nIn this manuscript, we have investigated the whole-body biodistribution of MMAE in tumor-bearing mice, and we have developed a PBPK model to characterize the plasma, tissues, and tumor PK of MMAE. The PBPK model for MMAE developed here can further serve as a framework for the development of a platform PBPK model for MMAE-conjugated ADCs [13].",

            "text": "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

            "text": "The cleavable linkers normally take advantage of the difference of tumor microenvironment and normal physiological environment to release the payloads that may be membranepermeable and can produce the bystander effect. The non-cleavable linkers need to meet the requirement that the antibody and linker must be disconnected after the formation of the antigen-antibody complex enter the lysosomal trafficking. This may cause the bystander effect that is a passive transport process to weaken, caused by the membrane-impermeability of linker-payloads connected with polar amino acids. Both types of linkers have their advantages and disadvantages, which are applied to the clinical trials (Chari et al., 2014;Bialucha et al., 2017). However, about 2/3 ADCs used cleavable linkers in the current clinical trials (Lambert and Berkenblit, 2018), in which mainly are dipeptide linkers and disulfide linkers. The non-cleavable linkers are not only more stable to escape from the off-target toxicities than cleavable linkers (Lu et al., 2016), but also may overcome the barrier of multiple-drug resistance (MDR) (Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015;Beck et al., 2017;Nasiri et al., 2018) for the reason that the payload connected with polar amino cannot be a substrate of MDR1, which will improve the MDR phenomenon. However, the non-cleavable linkers need a more elaborate process to produce activity such as the internalization and metabolism of the antibody in the lysosome, which is a prerequisite to release active payloads to exert killing activity (Rosenberg, 2006;Lambert and Berkenblit, 2018), and the polar amino-linker-payload also needs a distinct transporter to carry it from the lysosome to cytoplasm to work (Hamblett et al., 2015;Kinneer et al., 2018;Lee et al., 2018b), which makes the design of ADC more complex to limit the utilization of non-cleavable linkers.",

            "text": "Many cleavable linkers are currently utilized in ADCs, such as acid-labile hydrazones, reducible disulfides and enzyme-cleavable linkers (e.g., valine-citrulline). Several FDA-approved breast cancer ADCs, including sacituzumab govitecan, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, have cleavable linkers (Figure 3). Most of the cleavable linkers are susceptible to intracellular cleavage. However, chemical and enzymatic cleavage triggers may exist extracellularly [18,19]. Further, expiring tumor cells may release high concentrations of intracellular species (including glutathione and protease) into the TME, which facilitate the development of non-internalizing ADCs. Non-internalizing ADC mechanisms may involve targeting membrane proteins, the TME and the tumor stroma or vasculature. As a result, non-internalizing ADCs provide a wider choice of antigen targets, avoid insufficient internalization and trafficking to the lysosome, improve the bystander effect, and enhance tumor penetration to deeper cancer cells (Figure 4B). Internalizing ADCs' tumor cells can acquire resistance mechanisms. However, non-internalizing ADCs may reduce the drug resistance. \n\nInternalization is key to the effectiveness of ADCs with cleavable linkers. However, increasingly, several indications suggest a contrary mechanism. The dying tumors may release the intracellular linker triggers into the extracellular TME, facilitating the noninternalizing mechanisms of ADC. These linkers may be incorporated into non-internalizing ADCs. Therefore, the concept that the linker must persist in circulation before internalization and detachment within the cancer cells may need to be modified for non-internalizing ADCs. The linkers comprising ester or carbonate groups with modest stability in circulation have been utilized in integration with antibodies targeting the stromal constituents in the TME, permitting a persistent local drug release into tumors. Carbonate linkers already have been proven in a clinical setup (Sacituzumab govitecan). This linker type may be utilized only with moderately cytotoxic payloads.",

Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42].",

The chimeric antibody cAC10 targets CD30 and is rapidly internalized upon binding, which makes it a suitable candidate antibody to be used in an ADC format. Brentuximab vedotin consists of the cAC10-directed antibody and the microtubulin inhibitor MMAE linked via cathepsin cleavable valine-citrulline linker. A clinical efficacy comparison of the anti-CD30 ADC brentuximab vedotin and the unconjugated anti-CD30 antibody demonstrated 75% vs 0% OR, respectively, clearly favoring the ADC approach. The toxicity profile of anti-CD30 ADC was discussed briefly, with neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy as the main observed toxicities. This can be linked to the fact that nerve cells are more sensitive to microtubulin inhibition drugs than other cells. Next, data on the stability of the ADC was presented. The vc-MMAE product exhibited a half-life of approximately 1 week in mice and monkeys. It was suggested that MMAE in serum is partly responsible for the demonstrated toxicity profile.\n\nTo improve the toxicity profile, efforts were made to avoid the reversible fragmentation reaction of maleimide taking place, which results in detachment of the toxin from the antibody and thereby causing unwanted side effects. Avoiding this reaction resulted in a more stabilized ADC, showing enhanced efficacy and an improved toxicity profile. As an example a decrease in neutropenia in rats was shown. Another improvement was made by reducing the hydrophobicity of the ADC product, which could be an underlying cause of accelerated clearance. The drug-linker was engineered such that unnecessary hydrophobic elements were eliminated, which resulted in an improved PK profile and increased therapeutic window. Implementing a more hydrophilic MMAE product with a DAR of 8 resulted in a higher efficacy than the DAR 4 variant, which was the opposite for the hydrophobic MMAE product.

Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

            "text": "We examined seven potential ADC targets for the treatment of NHL, and in all cases, the cleavable-linker ADC SPP-DM1 was  effective in xenograft models. Our observation that SPP-DM1 ADCs have activity even when the antibodies to the targets are poorly internalized seems to be a general characteristic of cleavable-linker ADCs with membrane-permeable drugs. For example, CD21 is poorly internalized (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3), yet anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was effective in our model. Similarly, others have shown an anti-CD20-AcBut-calicheamicin, which also recognizes a poorly internalized target (Fig. 3) and uses an acidcleavable linker, is effective in a xenograft model, whereas anti-CD20-amide-calicheamicin with an uncleavable linker is not (27). A likely mechanism that would explain why cleavable linkers are broadly effective and less sensitive to the biology, particularly the trafficking, of the target, is that following antibody binding, the linker is cleaved in the extracellular space and free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach it's target. One line of evidence for this mechanism is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1; anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE is efficacious, but substitution of MMAF for MMAE on this conjugate results in an inactive ADC. MMAF is a more potent drug than MMAE, but is charged and relatively membrane-impermeable (7); thus, the efficacy of the MMAE conjugate in this experiment must be due to extracellular cleavage of the linker followed by cell permeation of the liberated drug. Although the data presented suggest that cleavable linkers are broadly active, our data also show that the cleavable linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5).",

In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

In vitro studies concluded that MMAF was less cytotoxic than was MMAE, because the charged carboxylic acid group hinders its ability to diffuse into the cells [71,83]. Different linking strategies including acid-labile or proteolytically cleavable linkers as well as non-cleavable linkers have been evaluated in auristatin ADCs. The proteolytically cleavable linkers are introduced to keep ADCs stable in systemic circulation and allow their easy release of the cytotoxic drugs by specific intracellular proteases such as cathepsin B [85]. The ADC SGN-35 was prepared by conjugating MMAE to a CD30-specific mAb via a protease-cleavable dipeptide linker, valine-citrulline (val-cit) as stated above [17,[86][87][88][89]. The val-cit peptide can be hydrolyzed through lysosomal proteases, then the paraaminobenzyl (PAB)-MMAE subsequently undergoes self-immolation to release the original MMAE (Scheme 5) [85]. This is one of the ADCs on the market approved by the FDA in August 2011. ADCs have also been designed to conjugate to cAC10 with mal-caproyl-vc-PAB MMAF and mal-caproyl-MMAF to give a protease-cleavable linkage and a non-cleavable linkage, respectively (Scheme 4B) [90,91]. Initial studies showed that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with non-cleavable linkage is higher than that with cleavable linkage. However, in some cases, the cytotoxicity of MMAF ADCs with cleavable linkage is more potent than that with non-cleavable linkage.",

            "text": "In addition, the coupling site of ADC drugs may also modulate the stability and pharmacokinetics of ADCs. A low DAR reduces ADC efficacy, whereas a high DAR increases the chance of aggregation, leading to reduced plasma stability. ADC toxicity due to joint instability is an important factor that causes neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy in patients, 67 limiting the widespread use of ADC drugs. Therefore, the use of more advanced linker technology to reduce toxicity to normal cells while retaining the beneficial chemical properties that kill cancer cells, improving the coupling site action to create a more homogeneous ADC and increasing the stability of ADC drugs are bottlenecks in ADC drug development. \n\nReceptor-mediated off-target effects are also important factors in ADC-associated adverse reactions. The IgG constant structural domain is highly conserved, allowing for the initiation of effector immune functions through the interaction of the Fc receptor with other components of the immune system, and normal cells can mediate the nondependent internalization of their targets by recognizing and binding the Fc receptor to the antibody component of ADCs. Fc\u03b3R is known to be responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via the Fc receptor, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and cytokines and causes the release of inflammatory mediators. In ADCs, Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector functions may be involved in target-independent uptake and cytotoxicity in normal cells. Alternatively, Fc\u03b3R is an endocytosis cell surface receptor and may mediate ADC internalization, leading to targetindependent toxicity in normal cells (Figure 3). 66 here are still few studies on the mechanism of adverse reactions caused by TROP-2 ADC drugs in lung cancer patients, and understanding the mechanism of adverse reactions will help optimize TROP-2 ADC drugs. It is believed that with the joint efforts of researchers to overcome the shortcomings and challenges of existing ADCs, the next generation of ADC drugs will benefit more oncology patients.",

            "text": "A typical ADC is composed of a mAb, a toxic payload, and a linker. A specific mAb forms the backbone of the ADC. It determines the specificity of the treatment and the location where the payload will be delivered. As such, an ideal antigenic target of a mAb needs to be (1) highly or uniquely expressed in cancer but not normal cells; \n\n(2) located on the surface of the cancer cells, which can be easily targeted by the circulating mAb; and (3) such antibody-antigen interaction can trigger endocytosis of the ADC [207]. Cell membrane proteins such as CD-33, CD-22, CD-30, CD-79b, and HER-2 with high preferential expression in malignant cells are commonly used in ADC development [211]. \n\nLinkers are another important component of ADCs, including both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are designed to remove the payload from mAb through enzymatic deconjugation or the tumor microenvironment, such as in hypoxia or acidic conditions [216]. Specifically, hypoxia increases the expression of nitroreductase by several magnitudes in comparison to that in normoxic cells [217]. Taking advantage of this feature, Wang et al. recently developed the first hypoxia-sensitive ADC using a nitroimidazole-based linker, achieving a 27-fold cytotoxicity enhancement in hypoxic cancer cells [218]. Enzymes such as lysosomal protease, \u03b2-glucuronidase, sulfatase, and glutathione are broadly used for target-specific payload release. In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds bridging mAb to payloads; such bonds are usually resistant to enzymatic degradation, and the payload was eventually released postdegradation of the mAb in the lysosomes of tumor cells [219]. One example of this class is the FDA-approved trastuzumab Emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae ) used for HER2-positive breast cancer.",

            "text": "Linkers are molecular sequences that covalently connect the antibody to a cytotoxic payload. Their main roles are to prevent the premature release of the payload in the circulation while ensuring its release at the target site. Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads [45]. Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity [46,47]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells [48]. Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers [32,49]. One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) [50].",

Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties [2,6]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) [2,[6][7][8]. All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect [2,7].",

It has been reported that athymic nude mice quickly clear exogenously introduced IgGs 35 . Therefore, to prevent fast clearance of administered ADCs, tumor-bearing mice were preconditioned by intravenous administration of human IgGs (30 mg kg -1 ) 36,37 . A single dose of each ADC (1 or 3 mg kg -1 ) or vehicle control was injected intravenously into tumor-bearing mice. Tumor volume and body weight were measured every 3 days. No significant toxicity caused by administration of either ADC was observed over the course of study (Supplementary Fig. 14). A single dose of EVCit-based ADC 3c at 3 mg kg -1 was curative and no tumor regrowth was visually observed in either model at the end of study (Fig. 4c-f). Furthermore, ADC 3c was potent even at a lower dose (1 mg kg -1 ) in the JIMT-1 model and all five that received this treatment survived over the course of study (Fig. 4c, e). In contrast, VCit ADC 3a exhibited only partial inhibition of tumor growth despite the high in vitro cell killing potency. Almost all mice that received this treatment died or reached a humane endpoint that required euthanasia before the end of study (four out of five mice dead in the JIMT-1 model; all five mice dead in the KPL-4 model) (Fig. 4c-f). Taking into account the molecular structure of ADC 3c, these results demonstrate that the EVCit cleavable linker system can fully elicit the therapeutic potential of ADCs in mouse models even if it is spatially sequestered from the mAb through a long spacer.",

Third, linkers may be cleaved intracellularly by thiol-disulphide bond exchange potentiated by thiols such as glutathione, which are expressed more highly in cancer cells compared with non-malignant cells [18,19].\n\nOn the other hand, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers depend entirely on internalisation followed by complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the entire conjugate to release the toxic payload [20].Non-cleavable linkers offer the advantage of increased plasma stability of the ADC complex, thus reducing the likelihood of premature payload release.This could potentially provide a larger therapeutic window and greater tolerance compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [21].\n\nDepending on the payload targets, which most often are tubulin or DNA, the liberated cytotoxic payload then leads to microtubule disruption in the cytosol or DNA damage in the nucleus, ultimately resulting in tumour cell death via apoptosis [3] (Figure 1C).",

            "text": "One of the pioneering ADCs was brentuximabvedotin (Adcetris) whose design paved the way for additional approved ADCs sharing identical drug-linker chemistry (Fig. 2b) 30 . To construct brentuximab-vedotin, the anti-tubulin drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was conjugated to CD30 targeting antibody brentuximab through a maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (MC-VC-PABC) linker 31 . Upon binding CD30 expressing lymphoma cells, brentuximab-vedotin is internalized and cathepsins cleave the linker at the valine-citrulline dipeptide. This triggers self-immolation of the PABC moiety resulting in release of free MMAE that arrests cells in G 2 /M. Theoretically, ADCs are the \"magic bullets\" that systemically locate and kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. However, the clinical experience with ADCs has revealed shortcomings, including toxicity and resistance [32][33][34] . ADC toxicities are classified as \"on-target\" or \"off-target\". Expectedly, ADC targeted receptors are not exclusive to cancer cells. Therefore, ADCs bind non-cancerous cells in a receptor-specific \"on-target\" manner with the drug payload damaging normal tissues. In addition, \"offtarget\" effects occur independent of target receptor engagement. Mechanisms for ADC \"off-target\" toxicity include: 1) linker instability prematurely releasing drug 2) non-specific ADC internalization by attaching nontargeted receptors, and 3) bystander effects occurring when ADC cleavage in target cells releases the drug from antibody constraint which then freely diffuses into adjacent non-cancerous cells. The cumulative clinical experience suggests \"off-target\" mechanisms drive toxicity since side effect profiles of different ADCs can be grouped together by drug payload and not targeting antibody 33 . In a recent meta-analysis, the incidence of significant ADC toxicities (grade \u2265 3) was reported to be 46.1% and included hematologic and neuropathy 35 .",

Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [20]. \n\nHydrazone linkers are susceptible to acidic pH conditions in endosomes and lysosomes, and release the drug by hydrolysis. Disulphide linkers are susceptible to reductive environment in the tumor cells due to high levels of glutathione produced in tumor cells [21]. Non-cleavable linkers release drug after ADC complex degradation post internalization. The antibody portion of ADC gets degraded in lysosomal and endosomal compartments releasing a linker bound drug molecules [22]. It is considered that non-cleavable linkers contribute to high stability in blood stream, longer half-life, and reduced toxicity to ADCs [23,24]. In contrast to cytotoxic drugs that require chemical conjugation to antibodies, antibody cytokine conjugates can be developed as fusion proteins.",

            "text": "An effective linker needs to be stable during circulation because the release of drugs in the blood stream will affect ADCs' pharmacokinetics, thus leading to toxicity and lower therapeutic index 48,52 . Once the ADCs are internalized into tumor cells, the linker needs to be cleaved, rapidly releasing drugs 7,53 . One critical factor that should be taken into consideration is the DAR. Too few drug molecules on each antibody result in decreased efficacy, while excessive DAR will lead to poor pharmacokinetics of ADCs because of higher hydrophobicity and lower solubility 14,47 . It has been reported that the DAR of most clinical trials ADCs are in the range of 2.0e4.0 14 . \n\nLinkers used in typical ADCs can be divided into noncleavable and cleavable linkers 4 . Noncleavable linkers usually rely on the lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic drugs which are attached to the linker and an amino acid residue of the antibody 54,55 . For example, brentuximab vedotin was designed to use a noncleavable linker (succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, SMCC) to crosslink the maytansinoid to the HER2 antibody 56 . \n\nThe structure of cleavable linkers includes a position of cleavage between the antibody and the drug 3 . Usually, based on the cleavage mechanisms, cleavable linkers can be classified into three groups. (i) Acid sensitive, such as hydrazone linkers, that are cleaved in the lysosome because of low pH environment. For example, the hydrazone linker is used in both GO and InO. In addition, although acid cleavable linkers are designed for maintaining stability during circulation and release drugs in the acidic environment, it has been reported that acid cleavable linkers could be associated with nonspecific release of the drugs 57 . (ii) Lysosomal protease sensitive, such as valineealanine and valineecitrulline peptide linkers, that are designed to release drugs after cleavage by intracellular proteases.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the concept of an ADc is compelling, and hundreds of ADcs have been built, studied, and tested. Since Mylotarg's first approval, 15 ADcs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both solid and hematological cancers (table 1, Sasso et al. 2023)-including Mylotarg which returned to the market in 2017 with a lower suggested dose and a revised dosing schedule-and over 100 ADcs are currently in clinical trials, with more than 200 ADcs in preclinical development. \n\nwhat we have learned over two decades of research, is that each component of an ADc (the antibody, linker, and payload) confers pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties that provide more on-target activity, but also a concomitant exposure to the rest of the body that results in off-target toxicities (colombo and Rich 2022; Sasso et al. 2023). to expand the therapeutic window, much research has been devoted to the development of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that improve the stability, hydrophobicity, and specific release of the cytotoxic payloads. ideally, linkers are stable in circulation and release payload in cancer cells. to achieve this dual functionality, linkers with diverse release triggers have been developed including pH sensitive linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers (i.e. specifically cleaved by cathepsins, glycosidases, or sulfatases), and photo-sensitive linkers. the unique properties of these linkers convey functionality to ADcs, but an in-depth analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review (Su et al. 2021). in addition, a collection of different cytotoxins with various mechanisms of action and potencies have been used to reduce off-target effects (Beck et al. 2017). A critical consideration when designing an ADc is how protein engineering and the chemistry of conjugation can determine the individual components of the conjugate, and consequently, affect its overall stability, PK, efficacy, and safety. Here we discuss advances in protein engineering strategies and emerging technologies that are being developed to improve the functional properties of ADcs.",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

            "text": "ADCs using the disulfide linkers have inferior potency in vivo due to the more rapid clearance of payloads compared with the non-cleavable thioether linkers that displayed more potent activity (Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). The trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) consists of noncleavable thioether linker and a maytansine derivate, which has better anti-breast cancer activity. The linker contained a cyclohexane carboxylate and a maleimidomethyl group. The ionized metabolite cannot kill surrounding normal cells due to its impermeability after ADC metabolized, thus the ADC has a better safety (LoRusso et al., 2011). The non-cleavable linkers are stricter in the choice of antigens compared with cleavable linkers, yet fewer toxicities (Polson et al., 2009). Zhang et al. (2016) reported that using methy-and cyclobutyl-substituted disulfide with efficient immolation demonstrated more potent killing activity than cyclopropyl-substituted disulfide with nonimmolation. Also, this reflects that the immolation of the linker is imperative to the potency of ADC (Zhang et al., 2016). However, the anti-tumor activity is more determined by the cleavage of the linkers only when payloads require complete cleaving to exert activity (Caculitan et al., 2017). Thus, new research could focus on developing payloads that do not require the production of pharmacological effects with prototype drugs. Also, future studies could focus on developing some novel technologies of payload-linker to improve the activity of ADCs such as SYD985 based on a cleavable linker-duocarmycin payload (NCT03262935) (Dokter et al., 2014).",

Increasing the steric hindrance of a linker (e.g., SPDB-DM4 linker payload construct) can enhance the stability of the ADC in circulation, with the aim of reducing non-specific toxicities. Cleavable linkers are mostly cleaved from the payload in endosomes or lysosomal compartments via a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones); protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide); thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (disulfide, carbonate). Conversely, non-cleavable linkers (MC and SMCC) require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody, generating a toxic payload with charged lysines or cysteines (Table 1).",

Therefore, measurement of residual unconjugated payload and related compounds is designated as a CQA for ADC products, which must be routinely monitored [113]. In an in vivo system, unconjugated payloads refer to the payload forms deconjugated in plasma or target tissues postdosing [12]. Plasma level of unconjugated payload closely correlates with off-target toxicities [47]. Intra-tissue distribution of unconjugated payload is also of great importance in understanding efficacy and toxicity of ADCs [114]. In this regard, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has been proved to be valuable by visualizing spatial distribution of unconjugated payload [115]. \n\nThe forms of unconjugated payload from cleavable and noncleavable linkers are often different owing to the disparate release mechanisms. Specifically, deconjugation of an ADC with cleavable linkers releases the free cytotoxin, while an ADC with non-cleavable linker mainly produces more complicated formats such as amino acid-linker-payload moieties after near-complete degradation of the antibody [3]. It should be noted that catabolism of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers might produce free cytotoxins as well, which is also characterized in pharmacokinetics studies [116]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers primarily release free cytotoxin; consequently, LC-MS-based analysis of unconjugated payload from these agents usually employs the same strategy as that for quantification of the cytotoxin.",

            "text": "The primary advantages of ADCs are that they can act as prodrugs during systemic circulation and finally release the free drugs at the target tumor cells. The operation mechanism of successful ADCs is depicted as below (Figure 3). Relying on highly targeted tumor antigen recognition and effective internalization, ADCs recognize and bind to a specific tumor antigen on the cell surface, then internalization of ADCs is conducted through endocytosis. Once entering the tumor cells, the ADCs are transferred to the endosome or lysosome which digest the potential linkers or antibodies and actively release cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, linkers play a crucial role in releasing the potent drug at target tumor cells. Linkers are classified according to different categories in terms of the mechanism of drug release and their stability in circulation, including cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers [32,42]. Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease. The optimal linkers designed to conjugate the cytotoxic drugs to monoclonal antibodies must meet the particular requirements imposed by the factors described above.",

            "text": "With both ADC and ACNP technologies, the selective release of the chemotherapy at the disease site is of paramount importance. In this case of ADCs, this is primarily due to the potential for side effects if healthy tissues are exposed to the highly potent payload. To prevent side effects, ADCs are mostly designed so the drug will only be released upon internalisation into the target cell. This often requires complex linker chemistry, using either cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are usually cleaved in response to a change in the physical environment such as the lowering of pH in the lysosome or presence of a lysosomal cathepsin-labile motif. With non-cleavable linkers, release of the payload is dependent on the general degradation and metabolism of the ADC in the endo-lysosomal lumen [29]. \n\nIn ACNPs, as the linker is used to conjugate the antibody to the polymer or lipid, the release of the drug is independent of this. Drug release in these formulations is therefore simply a consequence of both drug diffusion and particle degradation. Whilst almost impossible to prevent some leaching of the drug from nanoparticles unless covalently attached, the use of lower potency chemotherapies as described earlier may mean an acceptable premature release can be tolerated [30]. A strategy that has been explored to maintain drug inside polymeric nanoparticles until uptake, is the use of ion-pairing which serves to hold the drug within the nanoparticle longer through electrostatic interactions, limiting early release and providing a longer therapeutic window once at the disease site [30].",

It is one of the key factors related to the stability of ADC and payload Fig. 3 The important target antigens from tumor cells (overexpressed and driver genes) and tumor microenvironment (vasculature and stroma) are used for the development of ADC. Created with BioRender.com release profiles, and is therefore important for the ultimate therapeutic index of ADCs. An ideal linker should not induce ADC aggregation, and it is expected to limit premature release of payloads in plasma and to promote active drugs release at desired targeted sites. Depending on the metabolic fate in cells, two types of linkers including cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been employed in most of ADC drugs. \n\nCleavable linkers take advantage of the environmental differences between the systemic circulation and tumor cells to accurately release of the free cytotoxic drugs, and they can be further categorized into chemical cleavage linkers (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) and enzyme cleavage linkers (glucuronide bond and peptide bond). 41 Hydrazone is a typical acid-sensitive (pH sensitive) linker. Hydrazone linked ADCs are generally stable in blood circulation but hydrolyzed to release the cytotoxic payloads in lysosome (pH 4.8) and endosome (pH5.5-6.2) upon internalization into the targeted cancer cells. 42 However, hydrolysis of the hydrazine bond is not completely confined to the lysosomes, and occasional hydrolysis also occurs in the plasma, resulting in reduction of targeting efficiency and off-target effects. 43 So far, hydrazine linker containing ADCs are mainly used in hematological malignancies. For example, gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin both use the hydrazone to link calicheamicin with mAbs for the treatment of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), respectively. Disulfide bond based linker is another chemically sensitive cleavable linker that is sensitive to reductive glutathione (GSH). 44",

            "text": "The goal of nonclinical toxicology studies is to predict potential safety risks in humans. The predictive value of nonclinical safety studies of ADCs can be enhanced by the appropriate choice of animal test species and knowledge of the mechanism by which adverse effects are produced or which attributes of the ADC drive the observed toxic effect. Some of the factors which influence toxic responses to ADCs and the translatability of nonclinical toxicology results to clinical use, including those involved in interspecies differences in toxic responses, are discussed in this review. Each ADC component, i.e., antibody, linker, and small molecule, needs be considered when selecting the appropriate test species and interpreting study results, which adds to the complexity of evaluating ADC safety in nonclinical studies. \n\nIn an examination of possible reasons for the failure of animal studies to predict the peripheral neuropathy seen clinically with the vc-MMAE ADC platform, several possibilities were hypothesized and evaluated in detail [67]. After considering possible roles of antibody, drug, and linker, the authors concluded that differences in dosing regimen and the resulting differences in the level of and duration of exposure to MMAE in the peripheral nerve tissue are the most likely explanation. These pharmacokinetic parameters provide a critical basis for animal to human comparisons for any therapeutic, not specifically in relation to ADC use. However, the systematic manner of evaluation performed for this linker-drug is nonetheless instructive. This assessment included the consideration of possible species differences in antigen expression, type and stability of linker, and properties of the cytotoxin. These and other authors have also emphasized the importance of using sensitive techniques (in, e.g., neurotoxicity and ocular toxicity assessments) in appropriate nonclinical species in order to improve the predictive capability of the animal model. \n\nExamples of nonclinical and clinical toxicity results reported during the clinical development of ADCs for oncology indications demonstrate that each component of the ADC can play a role in the observed effects and should be considered when designing and interpreting the nonclinical safety studies.",

Use of cleavable linkers is a more traditional approach where the cytotoxic drug is intended to be released after being processed inside the cell. Examples of cleavable linkers-based ADCs include: gemtuzumab ozogamicin (pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers), sacituzumab govitecan, brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumavedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan (proteasesensitive linkers) and mirvetuximab soravtansine and indatuximab ravtansine (glutathione-sensitive linkers) (20,60). Even though they are specifically designed to maintain stability during circulation, it has been suggested that nonspecific drug release may occur in case of acid cleavable linkers, which can be overcome by using non-cleavable linkers. Both types of linkers are featured in the FDA approved list of ADCs with their own advantages (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The linker is a very essential part of protein conjugation, especially for ADCs. Linker chemistry can be tuned to impart adequate stability for protein drugs [150]. As mentioned above, PEGylation is an example of using hydrophilic PEG linkers to improve drug efficacy [151]. There are many factors to consider when choosing linkers for ADCs. Nevertheless, one of the most important of them is the stability of the linker throughout its presence in the plasma, while it must break down as soon as it enters the target cell (in the form of a conjugate with ADCs) and leads to the activation of the released anti-cancer drugs [152]. There are cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The cleavable linkers are cleaved by chemical or biochemical changes in the environment such as acidic changes for hydrozone linkers and glutathione or high pH values for disulfide linkers. Some other cleavable linkers contain enzymatic digestion sites and are sensitive to the enzymes inside the vesicle such as valine-citrulline di-peptides for cathepsin B enzyme. On the other hand, the non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete digestion of the antibody after entering the vesicle [153]. \n\nAmong the important reasons that led to the removal of Mylotarg from the marketing list in 2010 were items such as the instability of the hydrazine linker and its payload release [154,155]. More recently, Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) 1 with a non-cleavable linker is the first generation of ADCs approved for the treatment of HER2 (human epider-mal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer. Second-generation ADCs targeting HER2, trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985), was characterized to supersede T-DM1 by overcoming all resistance using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload, duocarmycin (DUBA) via different conjugation chemistry.",

            "text": "The immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorlyor non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing. However, the design of such linker systems is beyond the scope of the current review. The readers are advised to refer to an excellent recent review article by Ashman et al. for a comprehensive account on this topic [55]. In addition to linker design, site-specific conjugation using engineered antibodies and enzyme systems now enables the development of homogeneous ADCs with superior PK properties. The use of a site-specific conjugation method also allows for payload attachment at sites that can enhance systemic stability of the prepared ADCs. The use of improved linker-payload designs and highly active payloads in combination with site-specific conjugation chemistry will lead to more successes in the ADC field in the future.",

            "text": "First, Dr. Zacholski introduced the landscape of ADCs in the United States and the pharmacology of ADCs. Currently, there are 13 FDAapproved ADCs: six ADCs are approved for solid tumor cancers, and seven are approved for hematologic malignancies (Table 2). ADCs have been on the US market for over a decade with the first antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, receiving FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia in 2000; however, the majority of ADCs have been approved within the last five years. ADCs are comprised of three components (Fig. 1) which are integral to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The first component is a monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for a tumor-associated antigen that has low to no expression on other tissues. The second component is the drug conjugate also known as the payload, which is typically a conventional chemotherapy agent that causes cell death after cell internalization and payload release. Commonly used drug conjugates include anti-microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and DNA intercalating agents. These are extremely potent compounds that cannot be safely given outside of the ADC system. The last component is the linker, which attaches the monoclonal antibody and the drug conjugate together. The linker maintains the stability of the drug conjugate to the monoclonal antibody in the systemic circulation but it can efficiently release the payload within the target cell. Off-target, off-tumor effects or toxicities may occur as a result of linker degradation or instability in systemic circulation. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable, which relates to the release mechanism. Cleavable linkers release their conjugate in a physiologically optimal environment such as low pH or high glutathione concentrations. Non-cleavable linkers form bonds with amino acid residues on monoclonal antibodies, and as a result, are more stable in the bloodstream. Non-cleavable linkers depend on lysosomal degradation of the monoclonal antibody in lysosomes.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are mAbs that are chemically linked to cytotoxic agents. Although the concept exists for decades, only recent advances in linker, drug, and antibody technology have turned ADCs into valuable therapeutic agents as illustrated by the recent approvals of brentuximab-vedotin (Adcetris) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, marketed as Kadcyla). In addition to these approved ADCs, more than 30 other ADCs are currently in clinical trials of which the majority are based on linker-drugs (LD) that are similar to those used in brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 (1,2). Like many ADCs in development, both brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 carry tubulin binders (an auristatin and a maytansinoid, respectively) that inhibit tubulin polymerization and cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of the targeted cell. Linkers are either cleavable linkers, for example, peptide linkers (such as the di-peptide valine-citrulline used in brentuximab-vedotin) or non-cleavable linkers, for example, amide or thioether linkers (as used in T-DM1) that depend on complete degradation of the mAb in the lysosome and subsequent release of the cytotoxic agent.\n\nAlthough the marketed ADCs have an improved therapeutic index (TI) compared with classical nontargeted chemotherapeutic agents, there is still room for improvement. Brentuximab-vedotin, for example, reaches its MTD in human patients at 2.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is determined by induction of peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (3)(4)(5). Similarly, the MTD of T-DM1 is 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is also driven by unacceptable thrombocytopenia and hepato-toxicity at higher dosages, and is accompanied by peripheral sensory neuropathy as well",

            "text": "The basic principle of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is to enhance the tumor selectivity of cancer treatment with highly cytotoxic small molecules by covalently linking them to antibody molecules directed against tumor-specific cell surface antigens. Although it sounds simple, this underlying principle has proven very difficult to implement in practice, as illustrated by the fact that two decades of ADC development efforts by biotech and pharma companies have so far only yielded four FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved, commercially available products. Currently, more than 150 ADC programs are being actively pursued in different stages of preclinical and clinical development [1]. Although few, the success stories prove that a therapeutic window can be achieved with ADCs despite the required use of payloads that are 100-1000 fold more cytotoxic than standard chemotherapeutics. Such extremely high cytotoxic potency of the payloads is necessary because only a very small portion of the applied dose of an ADC is actually delivered to the targeted tumor (depending on the antibody used between 0.003%-0.08% of injected dose/g tumor), while the vast remainder distributes throughout the body, where it is antigen-independently taken up and catabolized by non-target cells. Therefore, it is not too surprising that clinical dosing is limited by adverse effects that are typically off-target and are determined primarily by the combined effect of the linker/conjugation chemistry and the payload used. \n\nADC linkers are either non-cleavable or cleavable. In the latter case, depending on the chemical nature of the linker, either low pH or lysosomal enzymes or reducing conditions promote cleavage, which allows the payload to escape from endosomes or lysosomes to the cytosol and to exert its cytotoxic effect. In the case of non-cleavable linkers, the antibody has to be completely degraded in lysosomes to allow cytosolic escape of the active metabolite which consists of the payload still attached by the linker to the single amino acid residue it has been conjugated to.",

            "text": "The linker component of the ADC, through which the covalent chemical bond between the drug and the antibody is created, should be chosen rationally, based on the mechanism of action of the antibody (whether internalizing or not) and limit potential chemical modifications to the drug in order to avoid loss of cytotoxicity. One of the main aims for the effective systemic delivery of an ADC is that the drug is released only at the target site; the linker, thus, must be stable enough in a biological environment (i.e., blood circulation) to avoid unwanted release of the pharmacological molecule. \n\nThere are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion [24]. A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell [25,26]. Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases [27]. Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells.",

            "text": "The most used non-cleavable linkers are alkylic and polymeric. For example, the MCC amine-to-sulfhydryl bifunctional cross-linker contains a cyclohexane ring structure that through steric hindrance protects the resulting thioether bond from hydrolysis [46]. The greatest advantage of non-cleavable versus cleavable linkers is their improved plasma stability; that results in reduced off-target toxicity in comparison to conjugates with cleavable linkers and thus provides greater stability and tolerability [47,48]. It is noteworthy that non-cleavable ADCs often have less activity against tumors due to the heterogeneity of target antigen expression where a bystander effect is an important contributor to therapeutic efficacy [49]. As described earlier, non-cleavable linkers require mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization to release the drug to the site of pharmacological activity in the cytosol. If the payload is linked to a charged amino acid such as lysine) with a Pi < 9.5, this will prevent escape of the drug by diffusion through the cell membrane and result in higher levels of drug-accumulation in the tumor cell which as a consequence should overcome the limitations of any bystander effect. In summary the major advantage of non-cleavable linkers is that they minimize drug release into the circulation thus limiting non-specific toxicity whilst maintaining, good in vivo stability [50]. \n\nUsually, non-cleavable linkers contain a thioether or maleimidocaproyl group. Examples of non-cleavable linker-based ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), an anti-mitotic drug, where it was demonstrated that the drug is more potent if linked via a simple alkyl chain to the antibody. Conjugation effected with a non-reducible thioether linker demonstrated very good activity in both in vitro and in vivo [51].",

Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker had similar potency, but a higher therapeutic window, than the corresponding ADCs containing a protease-cleavable linker. 233 In addition to chemical reactivity, the physicochemical properties of the linker as a whole should also be considered. Since ADCs contain more hydrophobic surface area than naked antibodies, they are generally more prone to aggregation. 230 Additionally, hydrophobic drugs are more likely to be substrates for the transporter MDR1. 61 Therefore, polar linkers that contain solubilizing groups like sulfonate and PEG not only reduce ADC aggregation propensity, but also potentiate elimination of MDR1-expressing cells (assuming the polar functionality is retained in the final warhead). 234,235 As a result, properties like potency, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic index can all be improved by using charged or polar linkers. 236 Presence of charge in the final drug moiety also largely determines its ability to elicit the bystander effect, as only uncharged molecules efficiently cross lipid membranes to reach neighboring cells. Whereas S-methyl metabolites originating from disulfide linkers are uncharged and therefore enable bystander killing, amino acid-conjugated payloads with noncleavable linkers are charged and less likely to elicit these effects. 237,238 It should be noted that toxicity to neighboring cells can be favorable (in the case of targeting tumors with heterogenous antigen expression) or unfavorable (when the primary casualties are healthy cells).",

Some ADCs, including brentuximab vedotin comprised of the payload MMAE conjugated via a cleavable linker, exert the bystander effect [111,112]. The disulfide linkage is another example of a cleavable linker, which exhibits bystander cytotoxicity, however, the thioether linkage, which is a non-cleavable linker, does not exhibit bystander activity [46,75]. ADCs with disulfide linkage demonstrated superior cytotoxic activity than with the thioether linkage [46]. Non-cleavable linkers are unlikely to exhibit the bystander effect as the antibody needs to be completely degraded after internalization, rather than the linker, for the drug to be released.\n\nInterestingly, although attachment of the PEG moiety overcomes the issues associated with decreased physical stability of the ADC as a result of hydrophobicity, the presence of anti-PEG antibodies in the circulation can detect and degrade the PEG moiety following any injection consisting of PEG polymer particles. To overcome this obstacle, the use of zwitterionic polymers can substitute for PEG. It has an advantageous prolonged circulation and resists degradation by the immune system following injection [113].\n\nAnother factor that presents a challenge is drug resistance. Payload internalization and retention is majorly impacted by acquired drug resistance mechanisms such as a low level of the target antigen on the tumor cell [105].",

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity [129,130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload [131]. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment [101]. \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

MMAE is a highly potent microtubule-targeting agent which blocks tubulin polymerization to arrest cancer cell division and has been used in at least three approved ADCs and multiple ADCs in clinical studies. Once the ADC is internalized, MMAE is released, typically by lysosomal cleavage, and leads to the efficient killing of the cancer cell. In some instances, MMAE also diffuses into the surrounding cells to exhibit a bystander effect. \n\nThe design and properties of the linker that connects MMAE to chMC-813-70 play a critical role in determining the therapeutic efficacy of ADC. The linkers lacking sufficient plasma stability tend to release toxic payload in circulation before reaching the target site and cause undesired toxicity. In addition to its stability, the linker must be cleaved in the tumor cell to release the payload once ADC is internalized. Cleavable linkers are designed to take advantage of the extra-and intracellular tumor microenvironments, such as differences in pH or overexpression of specific lysosomal enzymes (e. g., cathepsin B is overexpressed in various cancers). The cathepsin B-specific sequences like valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) have been coupled with p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (Val-Cit-PABS) and is one of the most commonly used cleavable linker for ADC development.

Conversely, to reduce the undesirable systemic toxicity from payload molecules permeating out of the tumor cells, ionizable payloads (e.g., containing carboxylic acids) can be used [29].

Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

            "text": "However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132]. Another type of non-enzymatic cleavable linker is the disulfide linker, which is stable in bloodstream but reduced to free thiols by a high intracellular concentration of reduced glutathione. Upon internalization, the drug-linker is released to cytosol after antibody degradation or linker cleavage in lysosome, and the disulfide bond in the linker is reduced by cytosolic glutathione. Anetumab ravtansine [97] and mirvetuximab soravtansine [133] (see above) are examples of ADCs with disulfide linkers, as well as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin whose linker contains not only the hydrazone moiety but also a disulfide linkage (Figure 3b) [134]. The serum stability of disulfide linkers depends on the substitution on the \u03b1-carbon atoms of the disulfide linkage [130]. Linkers with an unsubstituted disulfide bond were readily cleaved in circulation, and ADCs with such linkers showed a higher toxicity and a lower efficacy. On the other hand, ADCs with highly substituted disulfide linkers (e.g., Tmab-SSNPP-DM4 in [130]) had comparable stability to the ADC with a non-cleavable linker, with up to ~80% of the ADC retaining its conjugated drugs in vivo after seven days. \n\nEnzymatically cleavable linkers are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, most notably cathepsin B, which is overexpressed in many cancers [135].",

            "text": "A novel type of therapy that has recently been investigated in the clinical setting is the antibody drug conjugates (ADC). ADC are mAb against a specific tumor target on the surface of malignant cells that carry a small cytotoxic agent (payload), such as microtubule inhibitors and agents damaging DNA, utilizing a cleavable or non-cleavable linker [139,140]. When it reaches its target, the ADC is internalized with eventual release of the payload into the cytoplasm of malignant PCs, leading to cell death [140] (Figure 3). Cleavable linkers are degradated by enzymes in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells, whereas non-cleavable linkers require processing and degradation of the mAb complex into the lysosomes in order to release the toxic payload [140]. The target of ADC should ideally be a molecule highly expressed on the surface of malignant PCs with very low or no expression on other cell types, including hematopoeitic cells, to avoid systemic toxicity [141]. ADC can also exert their effects via ADCC, ADCP, or CDC [142,143]. a chimeric antigen receptor on their surface, which targets specific tumor antigens of malignant plasma cells. Similarly, bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies targeting both an antigen on the malignant MM cells and simultaneously an antigen on the surface of physiologic T cells, creating an immunologic bridge. ADC are monoclonal antibodies against antigenic epitopes on the surface on MM cells, carrying a cytotoxic payload. The binding of the above agents to their antigenic targets on malignant MM cells leads to activation of the immune system, with subsequent destruction of the MM cells.",

            "text": "The idea behind ADCs is the delivery of a potent cytotoxin to its target using a specific carrier. An ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to the cytotoxic drug via specialized linking molecules. The likelihood of systemic exposure and toxicity is greatly reduced, depending on the molecular target for the antibody part of the ADC and the linker's chemical stability in the circulation. \n\nThe key to obtain a medically relevant ADC is to optimize a few parameters including a suitable target, a powerful cytotoxic payload, an appropriate linker, and the technology to conjugate these at a proper antibody conjugation site. [1] This shows the degree of complexity in the field of ADC design and production. Currently used cytotoxic payloads derive from microorganisms (Micromonospora echinospora, Actinomycetes spp.), plants (Maytenus spp.), small-molecular-weight drugs (tubulin inhibitors, DNA cross-linking molecules), or even sea animals such as the sea hare (Dolabella auricularia), and have been further modified to exploit their potential. [2] Antibody-drug conjugates use cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. [3] The first group includes pH-sensitive, glutathione-sensitive, lysosomal protease-sensitive, and \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers. Their main disadvantage is the potential to release the payload in the blood stream, and therefore increase systemic toxicity and decrease effectiveness. Non-cleavable linkers remain stable in the blood stream and the whole ADC complex undergoes degradation within the target cell, leaving a payload-linker remnant with retained activity. Moreover, there is another major challenge that appears in any anti-cancer therapy, which is multi-drug resistance. It is either inherent or acquired, and may result from altered expression of the target antigen, different signaling pathways, or overexpression of efflux transporter proteins. [4] Virtually all used payloads may become potential substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and perhaps modifying the linking molecules of ADCs will effectively overcome this issue.",

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

            "text": "Abs exhibit specific binding to epitopes as antigens. Thus, Abs can demonstrate a highly selective distribution to the cancer cells based on cancer antigens. Drug delivery into the brain across the membrane can be carried out via RMT using anti-receptor mAbs with cargos [57]. Similarly, mAbs, as vectors, particularly ADCs, can deliver payloads into cancer cells across the membrane. Structurally, canonical ADCs consist of mAbs and payloads through suitable linkers that are non-cleavable or cleavable (Figure 1). Several classes of cleavable linkers for ADCs have been developed [58]: (i) pH-sensitive cleavable linkers such as hydrazones, (ii) reductively cleavable linkers, (iii) enzymatically cleavable linkers such as cathepsin B-labile Val-citrulline (Cit) dipeptide, (iv) self-immolative linkers such as p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) (Figure 3) [59], and (v) other mechanistically cleavable linkers. Moreover, intriguingly, although the maleimidomethylcyclohexane-1carboxyl (MCC) linker is a non-cleavable linker, lysine-MCC-DM1 (MW1089.69) (Figure 4) was isolated by lysosomal enzymes and transferred from lysosomes to the cytoplasm via carrier-mediated transport using the lysosomal transporter SLC46A3 [23]. The steric hindrance of mAbs inhibits the activity expression of linked payloads. Thus, ADCs do not show cytotoxic activity under normal conditions. ligand 1) Abs, as immune checkpoint inhibitors, block the binding between PD-L1 on cancer cells and PD-1 on T cells [54]. The binding of PD-L1, as a checkpoint protein, to PD-1, as a checkpoint protein, suppressed T cells. Thus, inhibiting PD-1 or PD-L1 allowed T cells to kill cancer cells.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Another modification, using cysteine bridging bifunctional groups is to reduce the maximum number of cytotoxic drugs attached to a mAb from eight to four. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed to obtain site-specific conjugations where sites of attachment of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody are precisely defined. These technologies are as follows: (a) applying engineered cysteine (such as THIOMAB enabling site-specific conjugation on only the heavy chain of the antibody) [38]; \n\n(b) introducing unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis to proteins and antibodies (such as incorporating p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine into an IgG1) [39]; (c) using enzymatic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate site-specific conjugations (such as using engineered glycotransferases, transglutaminases, transpeptidase sortase, or formyl glycine generating enzymes to form the site-specific functionalization of antibodies) [40][41][42][43][44][45]; and (d) using tubulin-tag labeling strategies [46][47][48].",

            "text": "Selecting a linker between the mAb and the cytotoxic agent is also important for ADC development. A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Another modification, using cysteine bridging bifunctional groups is to reduce the maximum number of cytotoxic drugs attached to a mAb from eight to four. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed to obtain site-specific conjugations where sites of attachment of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody are precisely defined. These technologies are as follows: (a) applying engineered cysteine (such as THIOMAB enabling site-specific conjugation on only the heavy chain of the antibody) [38]; \n\n(b) introducing unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis to proteins and antibodies (such as incorporating p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine into an IgG1) [39]; (c) using enzymatic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate site-specific conjugations (such as using engineered glycotransferases, transglutaminases, transpeptidase sortase, or formyl glycine generating enzymes to form the site-specific functionalization of antibodies) [40][41][42][43][44][45]; and (d) using tubulin-tag labeling strategies [46][47][48].",

(A) Each ADC, as a monoclonal antibody, consists of a crystallizable fragment (Fc) and an antigenbinding fragment (FAB) portion, the latter consisting of 2 light and 2 heavy chains, each of which has a constant and a variable domain, which is responsible for the binding affinity to the mutated protein (orange bars). This interaction is critical because antigenic mutations account for resistance to ADCs. (B) The payload (yellow arrow) is bound to the Fc through a linker (green arrow). This binding can be divided into cleavable and not cleavable. Indeed, while the latter are more stable in the bloodstream, and their degradation is not possible without specific proteolytic enzymes, the cleavable ones are divided in acid-sensitive, protease-sensitive, or glutathione-sensitive and are more susceptible to hydrolysis. This mechanism is closely related to the \"bystander effect\": the more easily a payload is released, the greater the clinical effect, such as adverse effects.

Non-cleavable linkers are based on thioether or maleimidocaproyl and require lysosomal proteolysis, whereas cleavable linkers are peptide-, disulfide-, or pH-dependent and are released through hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage, or reduction (Lu et al., 2016;Kostova et al., 2021). \n\nAlthough ADCs are highly efficacious compared with conventional small-molecule chemotherapy agents, their adverse reactions should not be ignored. Several clinical trials of ADCs have shown a variety of ocular adverse events (AEs) during ADCs treatment. In 2015, Eaton et al. conducted a comprehensive review of ocular adverse reactions to ADCs in human clinical trials, in which the most common ocular adverse effects included blurred vision, keratitis, dry eyes, microcystic epithelial changes, and corneal deposits (Eaton et al., 2015;Raheem et al., 2023). The exact process of ADCs-induced ocular toxicity is unknown, potential reasons include: First, ocular tissues may sustain harm as a result of linker-carrier instability, which causes the circulating carrier to release prematurely. Second, bystander effect: target antigennegative cells nearby are subjected to harmful effects from the free payload of the ADCs. Third, normal cellular uptake: through receptordependent and non-receptor-dependent (non-specific endocytosis) methods, normal cells may take up and transport intact ADC medicines, which could be harmful to the eyes. Fourth, drug particularity: certain ADCs such as the medenosine derivative DM4 and auristatin analogs (such as monomethyl auristatin F MMAF and monomethyl auristatin E MMAE), can directly cause cytotoxicity in corneal epithelial cells, leading to apoptosis and microcystic corneal epithelial alterations. Therefore, with the advent of ADCs, any ocular toxicity caused by ADCs should be of concern. \n\nNevertheless, comprehensive studies on ADCs-related ocular AEs are still lacking.",

Since similar toxicities were also common among patients within phase I/II trials of naked auristatin payloads [65,66], deconjugation of the payload from the antibody with systemic release of the neurotoxic microtubule inhibitors can thus be deduced. Payload release from presumably noncleavable thioether bonds has been also demonstrated [67]: during the \"thioether fragmentation reaction\" the cytotoxic moieties were shown to be transferred to the unpaired C34 cysteine residue of serum albumin. Identification of albumin as a covariate affecting the pharmacokinetics of the recently FDAapproved SMCC-linked anti-HER2 trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) [68] might explain at least in part payload-related systemic toxicities observed in late clinical development [69]. Lately, application of self-hydrolyzing maleimide drug linkers has been shown to reduce off-target bone marrow toxicities in rats through enhanced ADC stability [70], which holds promise for future clinical development of such ADCs. While ADCs under current development represent a unique treatment option they create a series of challenges in engineering, chemistry, and safety. Alternative payloads with reversible, easily manageable systemic toxicities, yet also high antitumoral efficacy, such as ONC in the present study, represent valuable alternatives.",

            "text": "A particular emphasis has been placed on understanding mechanisms of ADC toxicity, in large part because ADCs of the 2013 era-heterogeneous conjugates bearing antimitotic payloads-exhibited prominent off-target effects, such that the dose-limiting toxicities were typically observed in nontarget-expressing tissues. In 2015, Saber and Leighton [11] published a systematic review of toxicity studies submitted in 20 investigational new drug (IND) applications and concluded that ADC toxicity was not driven by target antigen but rather by linker/payload. ADCs sharing the same linker/payload composition tended to reach the same maximum tolerated dose, even when their target antigens showed endogenous expression in completely different tissue/organ compartments. This sobering observation revealed how far the field still has to go in terms of achieving specific cytotoxic payload delivery to tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. But it also offers a possible explanation for the high failure rate of 2013-era ADCs. It is likely that the lack of clinical benefit observed for some ADCs was the result of an inability to dose to an efficacious level due to off-target toxicities driven by the linker/payload. Indeed, de Goeij and Lambert [12] compared dosing requirements to achieve preclinical efficacy in mouse tumor models with clinically achievable doses for a number of ADCs and concluded that, in many cases, the clinical dose was insufficient for the ADC to reach its maximal potential effect.",

Membrane-permeable payloads readily distribute into bone marrow and into differentiating hematopoietic cells [157]. The deconjugation of intact ADCs within extracellular fluid within the bone marrow compartment may also contribute to myelotoxicity, as differentiating neutrophils secrete serine proteases that can cleave ADC linkers [157]. In addition to the off-target mechanisms mentioned above, target-dependent mechanisms may also contribute to neutropenia for ADCs targeting leukemic antigens [77,[158][159][160]. In a recent systemic analysis, Haubner et al. quantified the expression of leukemic stem cell makers. Several of them, including CD33, CD123, and CLL-1, exhibited a high expression level not only in leukemic stem cells but also in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which are precursors for neutrophil production [161].",

Antigen binding is followed by endocytosis, where the ADC-antigen complex is internalised within the cancer cell. Next, the payload cytotoxin needs to be released from the mAb in order to mediate cell death; in the case of non-cleavable linkers, the internalised complex is broken down via proteolysis within lysosomes, releasing the cytotoxic payload inside the cell, whereas the mechanism of payload release for ADCs with cleavable linkers varies according to the specific linker used. In all cases, the liberated payload subsequently binds to its target, leading to cell death via apoptosis [92].",

Furthermore, this ADC disposition model offers a conceptual framework for the design of ADC and facilitates the preclinical-toclinical translation. The PK model described above has been applied in auristatin-based anti-5T4 antibody-drug conjugates (Shah et al., 2014). It was discovered that the stability of the payload on the ADC and tumor size are the two most influential factors to the payload exposure in plasma. The linker controls the stability of payload and its dissociation from the antibody. The occurrence of extracellular dissociation increases the systemic exposure of toxic payload and results in a severe adverse effect. Therefore, it offered a rationale to modify the linker to increase the stability of the payload on ADC. Also, the sensitivity analysis suggested an increase in tumor size may lead to a rise in payload exposure in plasma. When tumors are small and avascular, ADC could only diffuse from the tumor periphery to the tumor. However, as a tumor grows and becomes vascularized, ADC can quickly enter the tumor by diffusion from the vasculature. Subsequently, the payload released from ADC inside of the tumor would also increase and diffuse to the systemic circulation. The author suggested that the difference in tumor size between animals and patients should be considered during the preclinical-toclinical translation.",

Additionally, there is ongoing development of target antigens like c-Met (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor), a hepatocyte growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 3 (HER3), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), which plays a role in stabilizing early melanoma cells, and CD30, a tumor necrosis factor receptor and tumor marker, for various ADCS applications [125][126][127]. \n\nRegarding linkers, the current research and development landscape primarily focuses on 64 cleavable linkers and 11 non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers encompass various types, including acid cleavable, GSH cleavable, Fe(II) cleavable, cathepsin cleavable, glycosidase cleavable, phosphatase cleavable, and sulfatase cleavable. Non-cleavable linkers include SMCC linker and MD linker. Recently, photo-responsive cleavable and bioorthogonal cleavable linkers have emerged alongside non-cleavable Mal-PAB linkers. \n\nAmong the studied payloads, auristatin-based and mertansine-based payloads dominate the field. Auristatin-based payloads, including MMAE and MMAF, are extensively employed. Auristatin, derived from Dolastatin 10 isolated in Dolabella auricularia, exhibits potent proliferation inhibition across various cancer types. It induces apoptosis by disrupting tubulin assembly and inducing cell cycle arrest. Mertansine-based payloads like DM1 and DM4 possess remarkable cytostatic activity at specific concentrations. However, they have associated toxic side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and nerve cells due to a lack of target specificity. Research efforts are underway to enhance target specificity through ADC conjugation to mitigate these side effects [118,120].",

            "text": "The advancement of self-immolative linker chemistry has also improved the stability and tolerability of ADCs utilizing cleavable linkers. In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design [196]. Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs [198]. This linker technology has achieved significant success with its application in four MMAE-ADCs out of the twelve approved ADCs. In addition, the PABC spacer also has been used in the development of PBD-based ADCs, including the approved ADC loncastuximab tesirine. Recently, Pillow et al. have developed sophisticated self-immolative spacer chemistry that enabled direct conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to engineered cysteine residues [30]. This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology [199]. In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency.",

Non-cleavable linkers, being the most stable type, generally result in better tolerability, but ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate superior efficacy, partly attributable to the bystander effect. 14 The payload typically consists of a highly potent small molecule with nanomolar to picomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The payloads of FDA-approved ADCs for solid tumors currently fall into three classes: microtubular inhibitors (auristatins, maytansinoids), topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, SN-38-active form of irinotecan), and alkylating agents (duocarmazine). 15 The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) refers to the average number of drug molecules conjugated to an antibody in an ADC. \n\nIt is a critical parameter in ADC design, influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the conjugate. A higher DAR may increase the drug payload, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy, but it could also impact stability and increase the risk of off-target effects. On the other hand, a lower DAR may provide better stability but may limit the overall drug payload. Finding the optimal DAR is crucial in ADC development to balance therapeutic benefits and potential challenges. 16 ADCs were first approved for hematologic malignances (lymphoma, multiple myeloma), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 17 Among gynecological cancers, mirvetuximab soravtansine has been recently approved by the FDA for relapsed platinum resistant ovarian cancer. 17 ncerning CC several targets are under evaluation, but TF is the most investigated.",

By contrast, only the ADCs targeted to CD79b and CD22 were effective with the uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 conjugates (blue lines, Figs. 1D and 2B).\n\nIn light of the relative specificity for the MCC-DM1 ADCs observed for CD22 and CD79, we decided to further explore these two antigens as targets. We tested anti-CD22 and anti-CD79b MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and MC-MMAF conjugates in relevant xenograft   (Fig. 4).\n\nCD79b and CD22 are expressed only in the B-cell compartment and are both expressed on the surface of most NHL cells (21,23). Furthermore, ADCs targeted against CD22 or CD79b worked with all linker-drug combinations tested, suggesting that these two antigens are particularly robust and attractive targets.\n\nADCs with uncleavable linkers exhibit reduced toxicity in rats when compared with cleavable linkers. ADCs with uncleavable linkers might be expected to be better tolerated than ADCs with cleavable linkers, as they should release less drug into systemic circulation, reducing the risk of toxicity (7,8). However, this may not necessarily be the case, as even uncleavable linker ADCs are metabolized and may result in bioconcentration of the cytotoxin or its metabolites. We therefore evaluated the toxicity of ADCs with uncleavable and cleavable linker-drug combinations in rats. We used anti-CD22 conjugated to the maytansinoids, SPP-DM1 (cleavable) and MCC-DM1 (uncleavable); and the auristatins, MC-vc-PAB-MMAE (cleavable) and MC-MMAF (uncleavable), as these linker-drug combinations are already in or likely to soon enter the clinic for indications other than NHL (25).

            "text": "Abs exhibit specific binding to epitopes as antigens. Thus, Abs can demonstrate a highly selective distribution to the cancer cells based on cancer antigens. Drug delivery into the brain across the membrane can be carried out via RMT using anti-receptor mAbs with cargos [57]. Similarly, mAbs, as vectors, particularly ADCs, can deliver payloads into cancer cells across the membrane. Structurally, canonical ADCs consist of mAbs and payloads through suitable linkers that are non-cleavable or cleavable (Figure 1). Several classes of cleavable linkers for ADCs have been developed [58]: (i) pH-sensitive cleavable linkers such as hydrazones, (ii) reductively cleavable linkers, (iii) enzymatically cleavable linkers such as cathepsin B-labile Val-citrulline (Cit) dipeptide, (iv) self-immolative linkers such as p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) (Figure 3) [59], and (v) other mechanistically cleavable linkers. Moreover, intriguingly, although the maleimidomethylcyclohexane-1carboxyl (MCC) linker is a non-cleavable linker, lysine-MCC-DM1 (MW1089.69) (Figure 4) was isolated by lysosomal enzymes and transferred from lysosomes to the cytoplasm via carrier-mediated transport using the lysosomal transporter SLC46A3 [23]. The steric hindrance of mAbs inhibits the activity expression of linked payloads. Thus, ADCs do not show cytotoxic activity under normal conditions. So far, 12 ADCs have been clinically approved by the FDA (Figure 5) (Table 1) [60]. All of them are developed for cancer therapy. Their payloads, such as microtubule inhibitors, mechanically show their anti-cancer activity in cancer cells. Thus, they must enter cancer cells across the membrane.",

            "text": "In general, a significant proportion of patients suffered various toxicities, sometimes so severe (or fatal) to require dose reduction or interruption, treatment delays, and supportive medications (Dumontet et al., 2023;Tarantino et al., 2023). Each of the blocks that form an ADC can result in significant side effects when these compounds are administered to the human body. Even if the nature of mAbs is responsible for moderate/severe immunogenic side effects, especially in ADCs preparations using murine and chimeric mAb scaffolds (Kim and Kim, 2015), the primary manifestation of a toxicity profile is highly dependent on the type of payload (Zahavi and Weiner, 2020). Most ADCs used in the clinic are loaded with tubulin inhibitors or DNA-interacting agents that exert their cytotoxic effects in the range of nano-or picomolar concentrations and are highly toxic when used in unconjugated form (Mecklenburg, 2018). Unfortunately, because only a very small percentage of ADCs reach their targets and a part of the payload is released prematurely, a significant portion of the dose is virtually free to interact with numerous non-target healthy cells and cause unconventional systemic or local side effects (Dahlgren and Lennern\u00e4s, 2020). The out-of-target toxicities are closely related to the linker. Non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in plasma and the ADCs are better tolerated by the body. However, in the majority of ADCs used in the clinic and foremost to the ones use in solid tumors, cleavable linkers are preferred as they have shown more benefits, probably due to the bystander side effect. This out-of-cell toxicity has two sides. On the one hand, it may extend the efficacy of treatment to antigen-negative cells found in the tumor niche, to cells that form the core of the tumor mass being less accessible to the ADC (Jain, 2005;Mahadevan and Von Hoff, 2007;Xiao and Yu, 2021), and to cells that have low/heterogeneous expression of the antigen.",

Additional cleavable linker formats include \u03b2-glucuronide linkers, which are hydrophilic linkers responsive to \u03b2-glucuronidase, present in lysosomes and tumor necrotic areas. The hydrophilic composition of linker provides adequate polarity and stability and solubilizes typically hydrophobic payloads [47]. This masking through hydrophilic monodisperse polysarcosine drug-linker configuration (PSARlink) sensitive to \u03b2-glucuronidase, was applied in the production of novel high-DAR ADCs, against T-DM1-resistant cells [48]. Non-cleavable linkers display greater stability than cleavable ones, remaining intact through proteolytic, acidic and reductive conditions. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers depend their cytotoxic effects on the degradation of mAb scaffold. More specifically, the active metabolite is released into cytoplasm upon complete antibody breakdown leaving only a drug-linker-amino acid part [46,49]. Of note, amino acid capping increases hydrophilicity and reduces membrane permeability, influencing the bystander effect [50]. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include non-reducible thioether, as in T-DM1 [29]. Further advances on linker technology have been developed in order to optimize and expand ADCs' utility.",

The recent clinical data from both Adcetris (SGN-35) [76] and Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) [27] conclusively demonstrate that improvements in both clinical activity and patient safety can be achieved with antibody directed drug delivery. There are ongoing efforts to increase ADC selectivity and efficacy by further optimizing linkers, sites of MAb attachment and cytotoxic payloads [77][78][79]. The selection of suitable ADC targets remains a critical challenge to ADC design. Characteristics of the ADC target such as copy number, heterogeneity and specificity of expression, internalization rate, and intracellular trafficking can be used to guide the selection of linker (cleavable or non-cleavable) and the potency and characteristics of the drug released (cell permeable or impermeable). However, further insight into the optimal design characteristics of effective ADCs will be best gained as additional clinical data become available. There are currently over 25 ADCs in clinical development and evolving clinical data from these trials will provide critical insight into the design of next generation ADCs.",

            "text": "ADCs are comprised of three primary components: a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to specific antigens on cancer cells, a linker that connects the antibody to a cytotoxic payload, and the payload itself. The monoclonal antibody enables selective targeting, which is crucial for minimizing off-target effects. The linker, which can be either cleavable or non-cleavable, ensures that the cytotoxic payload remains intact until the ADC reaches the targeted cancer cell. This stability prevents premature drug release, thereby reducing systemic toxicity. Upon reaching the cancer cell, the linker is cleaved to release the cytotoxic agent directly within the cell, maximizing the therapeutic impact of the payload [22,24,31,32] . \n\nThe mechanism of action of ADCs begins with the binding of the mAb to specific antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This binding facilitates the internalization of the ADC through endocytosis, a process that is critical for subsequent drug release. Once inside the cell, the linker is cleaved -often by lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin B -releasing the cytotoxic payload directly into the intracellular environment [33,34] . The released drug can then disrupt vital cellular processes, such as microtubule dynamics or DNA replication, ultimately leading to apoptosis of the targeted cancer cell [35,36] . This mechanism is particularly advantageous over conventional chemotherapy, which lacks the specificity afforded by the targeting capabilities of ADCs [31] . The stability of the linker in ADCs is crucial for ensuring the payload is only released upon reaching the target cell, with cleavable linkers responding to specific intracellular conditions, such as pH changes or enzyme presence, and non-cleavable linkers requiring complete ADC degradation for drug release [5,33] . Additionally, the bystander effect enhances ADC efficacy by allowing the cytotoxic payload to impact neighboring tumor cells, which is particularly beneficial in heterogeneous tumors [29,36] .",

            "text": "Another factor that affects the efficacy of an ADC is the efficient release of the drug from the antibody into the cell cytosol. This is achieved through the disruption of the chemical linkage between the antibody and the toxic payload. Thus, the choice of the linker used may have an impact on ADC efficacy and several different types have been synthesized. Acid-labile hydrazone linkers are designed to be stable within the neutral pH extracellular environment, but become cleaved within the low pH environment of intracellular endosome and lysosome compartments. 60 Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). 61 Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. 61 Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. 62 DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63",

            "text": "As one of the most difficult aspects of developing ADCs, the selection of linkers is critical, as it promotes the biological coupling reaction. Linkers can prevent the premature release of drugs, improve the release of active drugs at the target and promote the stability of the production process (37). At present, ADC linkers that have been listed and are in clinical trials can be mainly divided into two categories, namely, cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1). Cleavable linkers are also divided into hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and enzyme cleavable linkers. Hydrazone linkers are often coupled with doxorubicin, auristatin E, and calicheamicin. gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin, which have been approved by FDA, use hydrazone linkers (38). However, the instability of hydrazone linkers led to the withdrawal of Pfizer's Mylotarg in 2010. It was reintroduced in 2017 after its improvement in hepatotoxicity. Disulfide linkers are often coupled with maytansine and thiol-containing maytansinoid (39). Lorvotuzumab mertansine, coltuximab ravtansine, and anetumab ravtansine, which are in the stage of clinical research, use disulfide linkers. Enzyme cleavable linkers have better plasma stability than the first two kinds of linkers, which can be divided into peptide linkers and b-Glucuronidases linkers. Dipeptide linkers Val-Citrulline-PABC (Val-CIT-PABC) and Val-Ala-PABC (Val-Ala-PABC) in peptide linkers are widely used in ADCs, among which BV, which has been listed, is the most representative. b-Glucuronidases linkers have hydrophilic advantages, which can be coupled with highly hydrophobic drug toxins such as CBI groove binder, psymberin, camptothecin, adriamycin analogues, etc., to prepare ADCs (40).",

JBH492 is a first-in-class CCR7-targeting ADC, comprising a humanized, Fc-silenced anti-CCR7 IgG1 antibody conjugated to maytansinoid microtubule inhibitor DM4 via a cleavable linker. Preclinical studies support avidity-driven differential binding in CCR7-high tumor cells compared to CCR7-low healthy immune cells, and in vivo animal studies demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in multiple clinically relevant lymphoma models (Dang et al. 2022).\n Methods: This is an ongoing first-in-human, open-label, phase I/Ib, multi-center study in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (r/r) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) (NCT04240704), which completed enrollment for dose-escalation phase. Five dose levels of JBH492 monotherapy ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 mg/kg (intravenous administration every 3 weeks [q3W]) were tested with 3 - 7 pts enrolled per dose level. Preclinical data from xenografts predicted tumor stasis at 1.6 mg/kg q3W. The objective of dose escalation was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of JBH492 and to determine maximum tolerated and recommended doses. Pts with r/r CLL and NHL, who failed standard of care therapy (at least 2 prior regimens) and who were intolerant/ineligible to approved therapies, were included; CCR7 expression confirmation was not required prior enrollment.\n Results: Total 25 pts with r/r stage II-IV NHL (n = 24, [adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, 3; cutaneous T cell lymphoma, 4; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 7; follicular lymphoma, 1; Mantle cell lymphoma, 1; marginal zone lymphoma, 2; peripheral T cell lymphoma, 3; others, 3]) and CLL (n = 1) with median age 69.0 y (43 - 85) were enrolled. Mean duration of exposure was 13.5 wks. One pt had dose-limiting toxicity \u2014 grade (G) 3 thrombocytopenia lasting for 13 d. Overall, 23 (92%) pts had at least 1 adverse event (AE) (G \u2265 3, n = 11). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 15 (60%) pts (G \u2265 3, n = 3). Of 6 (24%) pts who had serious AEs (SAEs) (G \u2265 3, n = 3), 2 (8%) had TRSAE. The most frequent AEs (\u2265 20%) included anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia and dry eye (20% each). Two deaths due to underlying disease were reported. PK for total ADC was roughly dose proportional.\n Four NHL pts (2 T-NHL and 2 B-NHL) had partial response (PR) and 2 had stable disease, with PRs observed at doses between 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg q3W. Post data-cut-off, 1 pt with T-NHL achieved CR following 4 cycles of treatment. No correlation between CCR7 expression and response could be drawn (CCR7 expression was observed in all samples from 14 pts).\n Conclusions: The data from this phase I study suggest that targeting CCR7 with JBH492 is a promising therapeutic strategy for lymphoid malignancies with manageable hematological and non-hematological safety profile.

Nectin proteins are cell adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that participate in cell-to-cell interactions and form adhesion junctions between cells. Nectin-4 is widely expressed in epithelial cancers including bladder, breast, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian.\u00a0 By contrast the expression level of Nectin-4 is very low in healthy adult human tissues. Due to this differential expression, Nectin-4 has emerged as a robust tumor associated antigen (TAA) that has been clinically validated in urothelial carcinoma by Enfortumab Vedotin (EV). While approved, EV carries associated toxicity concerns including skin rash, peripheral neuropathy and ocular toxicities that can lead to EV discontinuations and lasting adverse effects. CRB-701 (SYS6002) has demonstrated high affinity Nectin-4 binding (~2ng/ml) across species and has selectivity for Nectin-4 among the Nectin family of proteins (>5000 ng/ml). The antibody retains potent in vitro activity against FcgRI and C1q (<10nM) conferring antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity in vitro. Compared to EV, CRB-701 (SYS6002) reduces free MMAE exposure by 4.8-9.7-fold when adjusted to ADC exposure (AUC) and there is a 2.2-7.4-fold reduction in MMAE in circulation based on Cmax in rats and non-human primates. Collectively these data reflect lower free MMAE in plasma, reducing the risk of MMAE-induced toxicities observed with EV in the clinic. This improved PK and safety profile coincides with a longer half-life of the ADC in plasma potentially reducing the frequency of administration to achieve efficacy. The internalization rate of CRB-701 (SYS6002) was 2-fold faster than EV when assessed in nectin-4 expressing cells.\u00a0 These data may explain the statistically significant reduction in tumor growth observed in a BL0597 patient derived xenograft model (PDX) of bladder cancer with low Nectin-4 protein expression by IHC (H score =50) when compared to EV at the same dose and frequency.\u00a0 Collectively these data suggest that CRB-701 (SYS6002) could demonstrate an improved therapeutic index and PK profile relative to EV and as such could achieve higher tolerated concentrations at lower dose frequency. The stability of the site-specific linker and the reduction in the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) could lead to a differentiated profile clinically that enables higher doses, longer treatment duration and a greater potential in drug combinations in nectin-4 positive tumors.

In preclinical studies, ZV0203 demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to Kadcyla in multiple tumor cell line xenograft models with no noticeable toxicity. GLP toxicity studies indicated that ZV0203 was well tolerated with an estimated therapeutic index of 35. Methods: This was an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation study in patients (pts) with HER2+ advanced solid tumors. Primary objectives were safety, tolerability and RP2D. Secondary objectives included PK, immunogenicity and preliminary clinical efficacy. ZV0203 was administered intravenously Q3W on a 21-day cycle. An accelerated titration design was used for the 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg doses, followed by a 3+3 design for 1.2, 1.8, 2.7 and 3.6 mg/kg dose levels. Results: As of January 18, 2024, 15 pts with solid tumors (breast [11], colorectal [2], gastric [1], lung [1]) were enrolled across doses of 0.3-3.6 mg/kg with a median age of 52 years old (range 35-65), of which 9 pts received prior HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab \u00b1 pertuzumab) and 14 pts completed 21-day DLT assessment (0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg [1 each], 1.2 mg/kg, 1.8 mg/kg, 2.7 mg/kg and 3.6mg/kg [3 each]) with no DLT incidence. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) occurred in 14 (93.3%) pts. The most frequent TRAEs were corneal epitheliopathy [9], elevated liver enzymes [6], dry eyes [6], neutropenia [4], anemia [4], leukopenia [3], and proteinuria [3], and most were grade 1-2 in severity. 5 pts experienced grade 3 TRAEs: lymphocytopenia (1.8mg/kg [1]) , corneal epitheliopathy (3.6 mg/kg [1]) and blurred vision (2.7 mg/kg [2], 3.6 mg/kg [1]), which were manageable during treatment. No unexpected safety signals were reported. TRAEs led to 13.3% (2/15) treatment discontinuation. Among 14 pts evaluated, 5 pts achieved a best tumor response of PR; 4 pts had SD; 1 pt had Non-CR/Non-PD per RECIST v1.1. Thus, disease control rate was 71.4% (10/14). PK results demonstrated that the PK profile of total antibody was similar to that of ZV0203 ADC, whose systematic exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner and remained stable after repeated administration. Concentration of DUO5 remained scarce, suggesting good stability of ZV0203. Conclusions: ZV0203 was well tolerated and showed clinically encouraging anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated pts with HER2 positive cancer. Clinical trial information: NCT05423977 .",

SHR-A1811 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a humanized HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Here, we report data from the phase 1 portion of a phase 1/2 study with SHR-A1811 in patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC (NCT04818333).\n Methods: In this single-arm, dose escalation and expansion phase 1 portion, patients with advanced activating HER2-mutant NSCLC who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting or could not tolerate chemotherapy were enrolled. SHR-A1811 was assessed at doses of 3.2, 4.8, 5.6, 6.4, and 8.0 mg/kg intravenously once every 21-day cycle. Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was guided by Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Dose selected for expansion was determined based on data from dose-escalation phase. The primary endpoints were safety, MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n Results: At data cutoff (Nov 8, 2022), 50 patients were enrolled. All were stage IV with a median of 3 (range 1-8) prior systemic treatments, including HER2-targeted TKI (66%), immune checkpoint inhibitors (68%), and anti-angiogenic drugs (78%). 96% had a HER2 kinase domain mutation. One patient in 8.0 mg/kg dose cohort had dose-limiting toxicities (grade 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). The 4.8 mg/kg dose cohort was expanded to 38 patients. The median follow-up duration was 5.6 months (95% CI 4.2-7.0). 62% of patients remained on treatment. Overall, objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI 26.4-54.8); median duration of response was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.4-13.7); disease control rate was 86.0% (95% CI 73.3-94.2); median progression-free survival was 10.8 months (95% CI 6.7-15.0). All patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). 42% of patients experienced grade \u22653 TRAEs, with the most common ones being decreased neutrophil count (30%), decreased white blood cell count (20%), anemia (16%), and thrombocytopenia (12%). Nine patients (18%) had serious AEs deemed related to SHR-A1811. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was reported in two patients. One death was reported to be treatment related (interstitial lung disease). After single dosing, dose exposure (Cmax and AUClast) of SHR-A1811 increased in a dose-proportional manner. PK parameters of SHR-A1811 and total antibody were similar at all dose levels, with low plasma exposure of free topoisomerase I inhibitor observed.\n Conclusion: SHR-A1811 showed tolerable safety profile and durable antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC.

            "abstract": "Abstract 56 Introduction: CD79b, a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR), is expressed by nearly all B-cell malignancies including NHL. DCDS4501A is an ADC consisting of an anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule disrupting agent via a protease-cleavable peptide linker. DCDS4501A exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in murine xenograft models of B-cell lymphoma. Methods: A Phase I study of DCDS4501A is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biologic activity of escalating doses of DCDS4501A in pts with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL. Pts receive DCDS4501A intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Intrapatient dose escalation based on tolerability at higher doses is permitted. Following determination of the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) based on protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring within 21 days of dosing, additional pts with indolent and aggressive B-cell NHL will be enrolled to further evaluate safety and efficacy based on Cheson response criteria. Here we report the RP2D and preliminary safety and efficacy results. Results: To date, 33 pts have been enrolled (64% male), median age of 65 years (range 20\u201385): follicular lymphoma (FL, n=14), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n=11), MCL (n=4), MZL (n=2), transformed FL (n=1), and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, n=1). Enrolled patients were heavily pre-treated: 29 patients had \u2265 3 prior regimens, all pts had received prior rituximab, and 9 pts received prior high-dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation. Pts received a median of 3 doses (range 1\u201312) of DCDS4501A in 6 dose-escalation cohorts with doses ranging from 0.1\u20132.4 mg/kg. The protocol-specified MTD was not formally reached, however, 2.4 mg/kg DCDS4501A was determined to be the RP2D based on the overall safety and tolerability profile at that dose, which included 1 pt with a DLT of Grade 4 febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) occurring in \u2265 20% of pts were neutropenia (59%), diarrhea (38%), nausea (34%), hyperglycemia (31%), fatigue (31%), constipation (28%), peripheral neuropathy (28%), pyrexia (28%), leukopenia (25%), chills (22%), and cough (22%). Neutropenia (39%) and leukopenia (12%) were the only treatment-emergent Grade \u2265 3 AEs in \u2265 10% of pts. Seven of 12 pts treated at the RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg experienced a Grade 3\u20134 AE: Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia in 5 pts, and anemia, leukopenia and fatigue each in 2 pts. Eight (24%) pts across all dose levels experienced a serious AE (SAE). Four SAEs were reported in 2 pts treated at the RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg: 1 pt with atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, and pneumonia and 1 pt with cardiac failure; in both cases the SAE resolved and study treatment resumed. Treatment discontinuation due to AE occurred in 1 pt each for Grade 3 neutropenia and Grade 3 hyponatremia. One pt had a dose reduction for Grade 4 febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. No deaths were reported within 30 days of the last dose of DCDS4501A. Most cases of neutropenia were observed in the absence of growth factor support. Assessment of Cycle 1 PK after the first dose of DCDS4501A indicated that exposure of antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE, increased with dose. The clearance estimates of acMMAE and total antibody were similar across doses from 0.1\u20132.4 mg/kg; volume of distribution estimates of acMMAE and total antibody approximated plasma volume, which also did not change with dose. These results suggested dose proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposures. Early evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed, including 5 pts with > 50% reduction in target lesion burden at the first on-treatment tumor assessment after 3\u20134 cycles of treatment: 2 with FL, and 1 each with DLBCL, transformed FL, and MCL; 4 pts continue on treatment with DCDS4501A (range 5\u201312 cycles). Two of four pts treated at 2.4 mg/kg evaluable for anti-tumor activity to date had > 80% reduction in target lesion burden at the first on-treatment tumor assessment. Conclusions: DCDS4501A, a novel ADC targeting CD79b, has demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile and encouraging anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated pts with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL. Updated clinical data will be presented. These results support additional clinical evaluation of DCDS4501A in B-cell malignancies. Disclosures: Palanca-Wessels:Genentech: Research Funding.

Patients will be enrolled in dose-escalation (Part A), optional dose-optimization (Part B), dose-expansion (Part C), and optional biology cohorts. Patients in Part A will receive SGN-35C intravenously across various doses. Part B dosing may evaluate doses from Part A. Part C and biology cohort dosing will occur at the recommended dose from Parts A and B. The biology cohort may enroll patients from Parts A, B and C, who consent to protocol-specified research biopsies.\n For Parts A and B, patients must have histologically confirmed R/R classical Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with no appropriate standard therapy available. Patients with PTCL or DLBCL must have CD30 expression \u22651% in tumor tissue from the most recent biopsy or obtained at or after relapse by local testing. For Part C, patients are eligible irrespective of CD30 expression and must provide tumor tissue for evaluation. All patients must be \u226518 years of age and have measurable disease per Lugano as documented by radiographic criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22641. Key exclusion criteria include history of another malignancy within 3 years of first dose, active cerebral/meningeal disease, autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) within 12 weeks of first dose, allogeneic SCT in <100 days, active acute or chronic graft vs host disease and having received immunosuppressive therapy for graft vs host disease, significant cytomegalovirus infection, grade \u22652 pulmonary or interstitial lung disease, or clinically significant lung disease requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids 6 months prior to enrollment, or those with history of clinically significant GI issues.\n Primary endpoints include type, incidence, and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, frequency of dose modifications, and incidence of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints include PK parameters, incidence of antidrug antibodies, objective response rate, duration of response, and complete response rate.

DCDT2980S is an ADC consisting of an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a potent microtubule disrupting agent linked to the antibody via a protease-cleavable peptide linker. DCDT2980S exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in murine xenograft models of B-cell lymphoma and is being evaluated in a Phase I study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biologic activity in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL. Methods: Pts receive DCDT2980S intravenously every 21 days at dose levels 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Intrapatient dose escalation based on tolerability at higher doses is permitted. Following determination of the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) based on protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring within 21 days of dosing, additional pts with indolent and aggressive B-cell NHL are being enrolled to further evaluate safety and efficacy based on Cheson response criteria. Here we report the RP2D and preliminary safety and efficacy results. Results: To date, 35 pts (57% male), median age 66 years (range 30\u201385) have been enrolled: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n=18), follicular lymphoma (FL, n=11), transformed FL (n=4), and small lymphocytic lymphoma (n=2). Enrolled patients were heavily pre-treated: 26 pts had received \u2265 3 prior regimens, all pts had received prior rituximab, and 7 pts received prior high-dose therapy followed autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation. Overall, pts received a median of 4 doses (range 1\u201325) of DCDT2980S in 7 dose-escalation cohorts, and 2 expansion cohorts at the RP2D. All 3 pts treated with DCDT2980S at 3.2 mg/kg developed Grade 4 neutropenia following the first dose, one of which constituted a DLT. No DLTs were reported in the 6 pts treated at 2.4 mg/kg, which is the RP2D. Across all dose levels, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) in \u2265 20% of pts were diarrhea (34%), fatigue (34%), nausea (31%), neutropenia (26%), decreased appetite (23%), vomiting (23%), and peripheral edema (20%). Treatment-emergent Grade \u2265 3 AEs were reported in 9 (27%) pts including 5 out of 9 pts who were treated at the RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg. Overall, neutropenia (24%) was the only Grade \u2265 3 AE in \u2265 10% of pts (24%) and was the only Grade \u2265 3 AE reported in > 1 pt (n=2) treated at the RP2D. Eight (26%) pts across all dose levels experienced a serious AE (SAE) of which one Grade 3 dehydration in a pt treated at 3.2 mg/kg was attributed to DCDT2980S. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 3 pts: Grade 3 neutropenia (n=1) and Grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy (n=2). No deaths were reported within 30 days of the last dose of DCDT2980S. Assessment of Cycle 1 PK after the first dose of DCDT2980S indicated that the exposure of antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE increased with dose. The clearance estimates of both acMMAE and total antibody were similar across doses from 1.0\u20133.2 mg/kg. The volume of distribution estimates for acMMAE and total antibody approximated plasma volume and did not change with dose and suggest dose-proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposures for doses of 1.0\u20133.2 mg/kg. Early evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed. At the RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg, 2 of 3 pts with DLBCL had > 75% reduction in tumor sum of perpendicular dimensions (SPD) and negative PET scans; 1 partial response was noted in a pt with FL treated at 1.8 mg/kg. These 3 pts continue on study, each having received at least 8 cycles of study treatment. Two additional pts with DLBCL receiving 0.5 mg/kg and 3.2\u20132.4 mg/kg had > 50% reduction in tumor SPD and discontinued study treatment after 8 and 6 cycles, respectively, to undergo stem cell transplant. Conclusions: In this early experience, DCDT2980S is well tolerated, has a favorable safety profile and has evidence of anti-tumor activity in in a heavily pretreated pts with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL. Updated clinical data will be presented. These results support additional clinical evaluation of DCDT2980S in B-cell malignancies. Disclosures: Advani:Genentech: Research Funding.

            "abstract": "Background: TRPH-222 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody and maytansine, a potent anti-mitotic agent, joined by a novel linker-conjugation technology (SMARTag\u2122). This approach enables site-specific conjugation of the maytansine payload while tightly controlling drug:antibody ratio (DAR), resulting in a highly stable anti-CD22 ADC resistant to MDR1-mediated efflux and does not mediate bystander killing. The primary objectives of study TRPH-222-100 are to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TRPH-222 monotherapy in patients with R/R NHL.\n Methods: TRPH-222-100 is an open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study comprised of a dose-escalation stage followed by a dose-expansion stage. TRPH-222 was administered IV once every 3 wks to the treatment population which included patients with DLBCL, FL, MCL, and MZL in dose-escalation. Single patient cohorts received doses of TRPH-222 starting at 0.6 mg/kg until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or grade >2 non-hematologic adverse event (AE) occurred, at which time the protocol converted to a 3+3 design. Data are reported here for the completed dose-escalation stage.\n Results: As of 30Jun2020: 22 patients were enrolled (1 patient each at 0.6, 1.2, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/kg; 7 patients at 4.2 mg/kg, 4 patients each at 5.6 and 7.5 mg/kg, 3 patients at 10 mg/kg); 11 indolent (10 FL, 1 MZL) and 11 aggressive histology patients (8 DLBCL, 2 transformed FL, 1 MCL); median age 68 yrs, median number prior therapies 4 (range 1-8) including 5 patients receiving prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant and 4 receiving prior CAR-T treatment. Two DLTs (Grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations; one each at 4.2 and 10 mg/kg) have occurred. Other treatment-related grade \u2265 3 AEs include (see table below):\n No treatment-related Grade 5 toxicities or serious AEs have occurred. Two instances of peripheral neuropathy have been reported; one Grade 2 event increased from baseline Grade 1 (end of Cycle 4), and one Grade 1 event (Cycle 1) in a patient with a history of neuropathic pain. Ten patients (2.0 to 10 mg/kg) have experienced Grade 1 or 2 ocular events, most frequently presenting in Cycles 1-3 as blurred vision and/or dry eyes, which have resolved to \u2264 Grade 1 with dose interruptions and reductions, and lubricant eye drops. The PK profile of TRPH-222 showed a long serum half-life (~5-10 days after first dose), with no unconjugated maytansine detected in samples assessed to date (up to 7.5 mg/kg, assay detection limit 100 pg/mL). No anti-drug antibodies have been detected in samples analyzed to date. Peripheral B-cells were reduced 50-75% after TRPH-222 administration at all dose levels, and 100% CD22 receptor occupancy (assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) was observed at all dose levels. Eleven of the 22 patients remain on study; study discontinuations have been due to progressive disease (n=7; 3 DLBCL, 2 TFL, 2 FL), DLT (n=2; 1 FL, 1 DLBCL), and investigator decision (n=2; 1 DLBCL, 1 FL). Five complete responses (CR: 3 FL, 1 DLBCL, 1 MCL) and one partial response (PR: FL) have been observed at doses from 0.6 to 5.6 mg/kg at the end of cycle 6. Four patients with CRs confirmed at the end of cycle 9 are now off treatment and continuing to be followed for safety and response durability. Remaining patients on study at the data cutoff were in Stable Disease or not yet evaluated for response; data will be updated at the time of presentation.\n Conclusions: TRPH-222 monotherapy is well tolerated through dose-escalation to 10 mg/kg, with a low incidence of AEs commonly associated with ADCs such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common AEs included low grade and manageable ocular findings consistent with known epithelial keratopathy of ADCs bearing microtubule inhibitors. These data, together with 100% CD22 receptor occupancy observed at all dose levels, and CRs/PRs observed at doses levels less than 10 mg/kg, support further assessment of TRPH-222 monotherapy in an expansion cohort currently enrolling R/R FL and DLBCL patients. These results support further clinical studies of TRPH-222, including combinations with other antitumor agents in B-cell lymphoma patients.\n Table\n \n \n Hernandez-Ilizaliturri: Epyzome: Consultancy; Seattle Genetics: Consultancy; Pharmacyclics: Consultancy; Gilead: Consultancy; Amgen: Consultancy; Takeda: Consultancy; Celgene: Consultancy; Karyopharm: Consultancy; Astra Zeneca: Consultancy.

            "abstract": "\n Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are two of the more immunosuppressive cell types in a tumor microenvironment (TME). Although TAMs and MDSCs can be converted from tumor-supporting to tumor-suppressing phenotypes by treatment with proinflammatory immune stimulants (e.g. TLR7 agonists) in vitro, such strategies have proven to be too toxic in vivo because of their systemic activation of immune cells. Therefore, for such immune stimulants to be used to reprogram the immune system in solid tumors, they must be targeted specifically to the immune cells in the TME.\n One strategy for targeting TAMs/MDSCs is to exploit a receptor that is expressed solely on these cell types. Because folate receptor beta (FR\u03b2) is expressed exclusively on myeloid cells and since FR\u03b2 acquires its ability to bind folic acid (FA) only in inflamed tissues, we have previously exploited FA to target attached TLR7 agonists (TLR7a) to FR\u03b2+ TAMs/MDSCs in solid tumors. While significant repolarization of TAMs and MDSCs was observed in this previous study, premature systemic release of the attached TLR7a caused unwanted toxicity. However, since FR\u03b2 was later found to reside in the same endosome as TLR7, we hypothesized that constructing a more stable FA-TLR7a conjugate with a non-cleavable linker should not only prevent premature TLR7a release, but also deposit the FA-TLR7a into an endosome containing a TLR7 receptor, thereby enabling selective activation of TAMs and MDSCs in the TME. The data summarized here confirm this hypothesis. Thus, free TLR7-1A was found to stimulate massive production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 upon addition to human peripheral blood in vitro or injected into live mice, suggesting cells in both species respond aggressively to TLR7-1A. However, performance of the same studies with FA-targeted TLR7-1A stimulated barely or nondetectable levels of the inflammatory cytokines, confirming that FA-TLR7-1A is unable to enter and activate cells that lack a folate receptor (FR\u03b2). More importantly, intravenous administration of FA-TLR7-1A into mice bearing an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor totally blocked metastases and induced tumor regression without causing detectable toxicity. Flow cytometric analyses of the residual tumor tissue further demonstrated that FA-TLR7-1A increased M1/M2 macrophage ratios and elevated infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor masses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a targeted TLR7 agonist can rejuvenate immune cells in a solid tumor without systemically activating the immune system.\n Citation Format: John Victor Napoleon, Fenghua Zhang, Rami A.

While significant repolarization of TAMs and MDSCs was observed in this previous study, premature systemic release of the attached TLR7a caused unwanted toxicity. However, since FR\u03b2 was later found to reside in the same endosome as TLR7, we hypothesized that constructing a more stable FA-TLR7a conjugate with a non-cleavable linker should not only prevent premature TLR7a release, but also deposit the FA-TLR7a into an endosome containing a TLR7 receptor, thereby enabling selective activation of TAMs and MDSCs in the TME. The data summarized here confirm this hypothesis. Thus, free TLR7-1A was found to stimulate massive production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 upon addition to human peripheral blood in vitro or injected into live mice, suggesting cells in both species respond aggressively to TLR7-1A. However, performance of the same studies with FA-targeted TLR7-1A stimulated barely or nondetectable levels of the inflammatory cytokines, confirming that FA-TLR7-1A is unable to enter and activate cells that lack a folate receptor (FR\u03b2). More importantly, intravenous administration of FA-TLR7-1A into mice bearing an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor totally blocked metastases and induced tumor regression without causing detectable toxicity. Flow cytometric analyses of the residual tumor tissue further demonstrated that FA-TLR7-1A increased M1/M2 macrophage ratios and elevated infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor masses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a targeted TLR7 agonist can rejuvenate immune cells in a solid tumor without systemically activating the immune system.\n Citation Format: John Victor Napoleon, Fenghua Zhang, Rami A.

Variable CD30 expression has been demonstrated in several B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL).\n\nMethods A phase 2, open-label, single-arm study is ongoing to evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory CD30-positive NHL, including B-cell neoplasms (Clinical Trials.gov [NCT01421667][1]). CD30 expression is determined by immunohistochemistry per local laboratory; any level of CD30-positive expression is permitted for enrollment. Brentuximab vedotin, 1.8 mg/kg, is administered every 3 weeks by IV infusion. Patients who achieve at least stable disease are eligible to receive continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Correlation between antitumor activity and quantitative CD30 expression is also being explored. This subset analysis presents interim data for patients with relapsed/refractory Bcell neoplasms.\n\nResults Sixty-two B-cell lymphoma patients with variable CD30 expression by central review (range 0\u2013100%) have been enrolled to date. Diagnoses include DLBCL (n=44) and other B-cell neoplasms (n=18) [grey zone lymphoma (n=6), PMBL (n=6), follicular lymphoma (n=3), and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (n=3)]. The median age of all patients was 55 years (range, 16\u201385 years), and the majority had an ECOG performance status of 0/1 (92%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior therapies (range, 1 to 19); 11 (18%) had received prior stem cell transplant. Forty patients (65%) had primary refractory disease, and 47 patients (76%) were refractory to their most recent prior therapy. Fourteen patients (23%) had never responded to any prior therapy. At the time of this analysis, patients had received a median of 3 cycles of treatment (range, 1\u201317 cycles), with a median duration of treatment of 10.5 weeks (range, 2.4 to 57.1 weeks). Twelve (19%) patients remain on treatment.\n\nOf the 43 efficacy evaluable DLBCL patients, 40% achieved an objective response [7 complete remission (CR), 10 partial remission (PR)]; the median duration of objective response was 36 weeks (range, 0.1+ to 62.3+ weeks). Of the 18 efficacy evaluable patients with other Bcell neoplasms, 22% achieved an objective response: PMBL (1 CR), PTLD (1 CR), and grey zone lymphoma (2 PRs). The median duration of objective response was 21.7 weeks (range, 6.1 to 37.1 weeks). CD30 expression levels for patients with a CR or PR were variable and ranged from <1% to 90%. There was no statistical correlation between CD30 expression and response rate.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring in >20% of patients included fatigue (40%), nausea and neutropenia (37% each), pyrexia (32%), diarrhea (31%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (26%), vomiting (23%), and anemia and constipation (21% each). Peripheral neuropathy events have been primarily Grade 1 or 2. Neutropenia (29%) was the only Grade 3/4 related AE observed in >10% of patients. AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 6 patients; the most common reason was peripheral sensory neuropathy (2 patients).\n\nConclusions In this interim analysis of 62 patients with highly refractory B-cell lymphomas, compelling antitumor activity has been observed with brentuximab vedotin.

            "abstract": "Abstract 443 \n\nBackground: Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) is a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) characterized by the uniform expression of CD30. sALCL accounts for 2\u20135% of all cases of NHL; approximately 40\u201365% of patients experience recurrent disease after frontline treatment with few effective treatment options. Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) comprises an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated by a protease-cleavable linker to the potent antimicrotubule agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). A phase 2 study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL (ClinicalTrials.gov #[NCT00866047][1]); updated results of this trial are presented.\n\nMethods: Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg was administered every 3 weeks as a 30-minute outpatient IV infusion for up to 16 cycles of treatment. Determination of efficacy was based on objective response assessments per independent review according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Patients were enrolled between June 2009 and May 2010 at 22 clinical sites in the US, Canada, and Europe.\n\nResults: 58 patients with a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1\u20136) were treated; 57% were male and the median age was 52 years (range 14\u201376). Seventy-two percent of patients had ALK-negative disease, 62% had primary refractory disease (defined as no complete remission (CR) or relapse within 3 months of frontline therapy), and 26% had failed a prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). As previously reported, the objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, the CR rate was 57%, and 97% of patients had a reduction in tumor volume postbaseline. At the time of this updated analysis (data cut May 2011), all but 2 patients had discontinued treatment with brentuximab vedotin; the median number of treatment cycles was 7 (range 1\u201316). The median duration of objective response was 13.0 months (range 0.1\u201319.1+) and the median duration of response for patients achieving a CR was 17.1 months (range 0.7\u201319.1+). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.6 months and median overall survival was not yet reached. Per investigator assessment, the median PFS with brentuximab vedotin was significantly longer than the median PFS achieved with the most recent prior therapy (20.0 months vs. 5.9 months; P value <0.001). All subgroups of patients analyzed in the study achieved a similar level of antitumor activity, regardless of baseline disease characteristics, tumor burden, or prior treatment history. Responses were particularly noteworthy in patients who had never responded to any previous therapy (n=13); in this subgroup of patients, 10 achieved an objective response (77%) and 4 a CR (31%). After discontinuing treatment in the study, 16 patients (28%) received a hematopoietic SCT (8 allogeneic, 8 autologous).

            "text": "Abstract 443 \n\nBackground: Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) is a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) characterized by the uniform expression of CD30. sALCL accounts for 2\u20135% of all cases of NHL; approximately 40\u201365% of patients experience recurrent disease after frontline treatment with few effective treatment options. Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) comprises an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated by a protease-cleavable linker to the potent antimicrotubule agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). A phase 2 study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL (ClinicalTrials.gov #[NCT00866047][1]); updated results of this trial are presented.\n\nMethods: Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg was administered every 3 weeks as a 30-minute outpatient IV infusion for up to 16 cycles of treatment. Determination of efficacy was based on objective response assessments per independent review according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Patients were enrolled between June 2009 and May 2010 at 22 clinical sites in the US, Canada, and Europe.\n\nResults: 58 patients with a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1\u20136) were treated; 57% were male and the median age was 52 years (range 14\u201376). Seventy-two percent of patients had ALK-negative disease, 62% had primary refractory disease (defined as no complete remission (CR) or relapse within 3 months of frontline therapy), and 26% had failed a prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). As previously reported, the objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, the CR rate was 57%, and 97% of patients had a reduction in tumor volume postbaseline. At the time of this updated analysis (data cut May 2011), all but 2 patients had discontinued treatment with brentuximab vedotin; the median number of treatment cycles was 7 (range 1\u201316). The median duration of objective response was 13.0 months (range 0.1\u201319.1+) and the median duration of response for patients achieving a CR was 17.1 months (range 0.7\u201319.1+). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.6 months and median overall survival was not yet reached. Per investigator assessment, the median PFS with brentuximab vedotin was significantly longer than the median PFS achieved with the most recent prior therapy (20.0 months vs. 5.9 months; P value <0.001). All subgroups of patients analyzed in the study achieved a similar level of antitumor activity, regardless of baseline disease characteristics, tumor burden, or prior treatment history. Responses were particularly noteworthy in patients who had never responded to any previous therapy (n=13); in this subgroup of patients, 10 achieved an objective response (77%) and 4 a CR (31%). After discontinuing treatment in the study, 16 patients (28%) received a hematopoietic SCT (8 allogeneic, 8 autologous). The most common adverse events observed in the study were peripheral sensory neuropathy (41%), nausea (40%), fatigue (38%), pyrexia (34%), diarrhea (29%), rash (24%), constipation (22%), and neutropenia (21%). Most AEs in the study were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Ten patients (17%) experienced Grade 3 events of peripheral neuropathy as defined in a Standardised MedDRA Query; no Grade 4 events were observed. In patients with neuropathy, 79% (26 of 33) have experienced resolution or some improvement and the median time to resolution or improvement was 13.3 weeks (range 0.3\u201348.7).\n\nConclusions: Durable complete remissions were achieved with brentuximab vedotin, and treatment was associated with manageable toxicity, in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. Approximately half of the responding patients (24 of 50) continued in remission at the time of this analysis; updated results of efficacy and long term safety will be presented at the meeting. Based on the results from this study, a trial evaluating the safety of brentuximab vedotin administered in sequence and in combination with multiagent chemotherapy was initiated and is currently ongoing in frontline sALCL.\n\nDisclosures: Advani: Seattle Genetics, Inc.: Honoraria, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding.

            "abstract": "Introduction: Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is an oncofetal protein that is physiologically expressed during embryogenesis, largely disappears by birth, but can be reexpressed pathologically in transformed tissues of many hematological and solid cancers. VLS-101 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a rapidly internalizing, humanized monoclonal antibody (UC-961) that recognizes extracellular ROR1, a cleavable linker, and the anti-microtubule cytotoxin, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).\n Methods: This first-in-human, Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, and efficacy of VLS-101 in patients unselected for tumor ROR1 expression who had previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), or Richter transformation lymphoma (RTL). VLS-101 was infused over 30 min every 3 wk until cancer progression or intolerable toxicity. After accrual of 1 patient at the first dose level, cohorts were enrolled by 3+3 dose escalation with additional patients accrued and intrapatient dose escalation permitted to refine estimates of maximum tolerated dose and recommended dosing regimen (RDR).\n Results: 32 patients were enrolled, including 19 males and 13 females with median (range) ages of 70 (54-84) ys; ECOG performance status (n) of 0 (18), 1 (10), or 2 (4); and tumor types (n) of MCL (15), CLL (7), DLBCL (5), FL (3), MZL (1), and RTL (1). Patients had received a median (range) of 4 (1-24) prior systemic therapies including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (5) and/or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T or -natural killer (NK) cells (6). Among patients with MCL, 15/15 (100%) had received a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), 13/15 (87%) discontinued the BTKi due to progressive disease, and 2/15 (13%) discontinued for atrial fibrillation after 15.6 or 68.5 months of BTKi therapy. Patients (n) by VLS-101 starting dose were 0.5 (1), 1.0 (3), 1.5 (3), 2.25 (11), and 2.5 (14) mg/kg. With intrapatient dose escalation, many patients (n) received a maximum of 2.25 mg/kg (12) or 2.5 mg/kg (17) during VLS-101 therapy (range: 1 to 13 cycles). Cycle 1 DLTs (n/N) by mg/kg dose level were 0.5 (0/1), 1.0 (0/3), 1.5 (0/3), 2.25 (1/11 [9%] Gr 4 neutropenia), and 2.5 (2/14 [14%]; one Gr 4 neutropenia; one Gr 3 diarrhea of uncertain cause). Gr 4 neutropenia occurred in 9/32 (28%) patients; 1/32 (3%) had neutropenic fever. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor successfully ameliorated neutropenia. Baseline Gr 1 neuropathy was present in 10/32 (31%) patients. On-study reversible Gr 3 neuropathy occurred in 3/32 (9%) patients; no Gr 4 neuropathy occurred. Except for Gr \u22642 alopecia in 3/32 (9%) patients, other adverse events were not obviously drug-related. Considering all 175 infusions administered, drug-related infusion reactions, vomiting, tumor lysis syndrome, rash, hepatic or renal abnormalities, or QT prolongation were not observed. PK showed changes in ADC and MMAE exposures proportional with VLS-101 dose and a mean ADC half-life of ~2.5 d. PD indicated exposure-dependent ROR1 occupancy on circulating CLL cells. No neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were detected. Objective tumor responses were not seen in patients with other tumor types but were observed in 7/15 (47%) of patients with MCL (4 partial; 3 complete) and in 4/5 (80%) of patients with DLBCL (2 partial; 2 complete). From start of therapy, 6/7 patients with responding MCL have responses ongoing at 35, 38, 45, 47, 50, and 58 wk and 2/4 patients with responding DLBCL have responses ongoing at 23 and 47 wk of follow-up.\n Conclusions: In heavily pretreated patients, VLS-101 infusions were well tolerated and demonstrated a predictable safety profile consistent with an MMAE-containing ADC. Tumor selectivity was confirmed, with no evidence of ROR1-mediated toxicities or non-MMAE toxicities that would suggest normal tissue binding. Considering all data, the VLS-101 RDR was 2.5 mg/kg every 3 wk. Efficacy results provide clinical proof of concept for targeting ROR1 with VLS-101 and demonstrate durable objective responses in patients with advanced MCL or DLBCL, including those with prior BTKi or cellular therapies. Phase 1-2 studies of VLS-101 monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with hematological cancers and solid tumors are planned.\n Figure\n \n \n Wang: Nobel Insights: Consultancy; Lu Daopei Medical Group: Honoraria; Oncternal: Consultancy, Research Funding; MoreHealth: Consultancy; Juno: Consultancy, Research Funding; Loxo Oncology: Consultancy, Research Funding; Acerta Pharma: Research Funding; InnoCare: Consultancy; OncLive: Honoraria; Guidepoint Global: Consultancy; VelosBio: Research Funding; Pulse Biosciences: Consultancy; Kite Pharma: Consultancy, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Beijing Medical Award Foundation: Honoraria; Pharmacyclics: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; OMI: Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses; Celgene: Consultancy, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; BioInvent: Research Funding; Molecular Templates: Research Funding; Verastem: Research Funding; Dava Oncology: Honoraria; AstraZeneca: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Janssen: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Targeted Oncology: Honoraria.

Gr 4 neutropenia occurred in 9/32 (28%) patients; 1/32 (3%) had neutropenic fever. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor successfully ameliorated neutropenia. Baseline Gr 1 neuropathy was present in 10/32 (31%) patients. On-study reversible Gr 3 neuropathy occurred in 3/32 (9%) patients; no Gr 4 neuropathy occurred. Except for Gr \u22642 alopecia in 3/32 (9%) patients, other adverse events were not obviously drug-related. Considering all 175 infusions administered, drug-related infusion reactions, vomiting, tumor lysis syndrome, rash, hepatic or renal abnormalities, or QT prolongation were not observed. PK showed changes in ADC and MMAE exposures proportional with VLS-101 dose and a mean ADC half-life of ~2.5 d. PD indicated exposure-dependent ROR1 occupancy on circulating CLL cells. No neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were detected. Objective tumor responses were not seen in patients with other tumor types but were observed in 7/15 (47%) of patients with MCL (4 partial; 3 complete) and in 4/5 (80%) of patients with DLBCL (2 partial; 2 complete). From start of therapy, 6/7 patients with responding MCL have responses ongoing at 35, 38, 45, 47, 50, and 58 wk and 2/4 patients with responding DLBCL have responses ongoing at 23 and 47 wk of follow-up.\n Conclusions: In heavily pretreated patients, VLS-101 infusions were well tolerated and demonstrated a predictable safety profile consistent with an MMAE-containing ADC. Tumor selectivity was confirmed, with no evidence of ROR1-mediated toxicities or non-MMAE toxicities that would suggest normal tissue binding. Considering all data, the VLS-101 RDR was 2.5 mg/kg every 3 wk. Efficacy results provide clinical proof of concept for targeting ROR1 with VLS-101 and demonstrate durable objective responses in patients with advanced MCL or DLBCL, including those with prior BTKi or cellular therapies. Phase 1-2 studies of VLS-101 monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with hematological cancers and solid tumors are planned.\n Figure\n \n \n Wang: Nobel Insights: Consultancy; Lu Daopei Medical Group: Honoraria; Oncternal: Consultancy, Research Funding; MoreHealth: Consultancy; Juno: Consultancy, Research Funding; Loxo Oncology: Consultancy, Research Funding; Acerta Pharma: Research Funding; InnoCare: Consultancy; OncLive: Honoraria; Guidepoint Global: Consultancy; VelosBio: Research Funding; Pulse Biosciences: Consultancy; Kite Pharma: Consultancy, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Beijing Medical Award Foundation: Honoraria; Pharmacyclics: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; OMI: Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses; Celgene: Consultancy, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; BioInvent: Research Funding; Molecular Templates: Research Funding; Verastem: Research Funding; Dava Oncology: Honoraria; AstraZeneca: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Janssen: Consultancy, Honoraria, Other: Travel, accommodation, expenses, Research Funding; Targeted Oncology: Honoraria.

Approximately 40\u201365% of patients with sALCL develop recurrent disease after frontline treatment and few effective treatment options exist for this population. Brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u00ae) comprises an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated by a protease-cleavable linker to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent. Brentuximab vedotin selectively induces apoptotic death of CD30-positive cells by binding, internalizing, and releasing MMAE. A phase 2 study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00866047); long-term follow-up data from this ongoing trial are presented. Methods: Patients received 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks as a 30-minute outpatient IV infusion for up to 16 cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) per independent review according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Results: 58 patients were enrolled at 22 clinical sites in the US, Canada, and Europe. The median age was 52 years (range 14\u201376) and 57% were male. 72% of patients had ALK-negative disease, 62% had primary refractory disease (defined as no complete remission [CR] or relapse within 3 months of frontline therapy), and 26% had failed a prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). As previously reported, the ORR was 86% (50 of 58 patients) and the CR rate was 59% (34 of 58 patients). At the time of this analysis (datacut April 2012), all patients had discontinued treatment and the median observation time from first dose was 22.8 months (range, 0.8\u201332.2). The median duration of objective response for all patients was 13.2 months (range, 0.1\u201327.7+) and the median duration of response for patients who obtained a CR has not yet been met (range, 0.7\u201327.7+). Of the patients who achieved a CR, over half (18 of 34; 53%) were in continued remission at the time of this analysis. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients was 14.6 months and the median overall survival has not yet been reached. After discontinuing treatment in the study, 16 patients (28%) received a hematopoietic SCT (8 allogeneic, 8 autologous). The median PFS has not yet been met for the group of patients who achieved a CR and received a subsequent SCT (range, 8.1\u201329+), while the median PFS for the group who achieved a CR and did not receive post-treatment SCT was 18.4 months (range, 2.6\u201326+). All subgroups of patients analyzed in the study achieved a similar level of antitumor activity regardless of baseline disease characteristics, tumor burden, or prior treatment history. Median PFS did not appear to be influenced by ALK status; in the subgroup of ALK-positive patients (n=16) PFS was 14.6 months versus 14.3 months for ALK-negative patients (n=42). The median overall survival has not yet been met for either ALK-positive or ALK-negative patients. The most common (reported in \u226520% of patients) adverse events (AEs) observed in the study were peripheral sensory neuropathy (41%), nausea (40%), fatigue (38%), pyrexia (34%), diarrhea (29%), rash (24%), constipation (22%), and neutropenia (21%). The majority of AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Ten patients (17%) experienced Grade 3 events of peripheral neuropathy as defined by a Standardised MedDRA Query; no Grade 4 events were observed. Resolution or at least 1 grade of improvement in peripheral neuropathy has occurred in 79% of patients with neuropathy events (26 of 33 patients) and the median time to resolution or improvement was 13.4 weeks (range, 0.3\u201348.7). Conclusions: 34 of 58 patients (59%) with relapsed or refractory sALCL obtained a durable CR with brentuximab vedotin and treatment was associated with manageable toxicity. PFS did not appear to be influenced by ALK status. These long-term follow-up results underscore the durability of clinical benefit obtained with brentuximab vedotin. A randomized phase 3 study is planned to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone for frontline treatment of CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphomas.

Resolution or at least 1 grade of improvement in peripheral neuropathy has occurred in 79% of patients with neuropathy events (26 of 33 patients) and the median time to resolution or improvement was 13.4 weeks (range, 0.3\u201348.7). Conclusions: 34 of 58 patients (59%) with relapsed or refractory sALCL obtained a durable CR with brentuximab vedotin and treatment was associated with manageable toxicity. PFS did not appear to be influenced by ALK status. These long-term follow-up results underscore the durability of clinical benefit obtained with brentuximab vedotin. A randomized phase 3 study is planned to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone for frontline treatment of CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphomas.

            "abstract": "\n Background\n Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody, a protease-cleavable linker, and the microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Direct cytotoxicity, driven by MMAE, is at the heart of the multifaceted anticancer activity of BV (Sutherland 2006). BV was the first ADC to be approved in multiple cancer types, including treatment-na\u00efve Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) (Connors 2017). Nivolumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death protein 1 and is approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL. Both agents have been well tolerated with encouraging activity when combined with multi-agent chemotherapy. BV plus nivolumab was evaluated as a frontline treatment option for patients with cHL who are \u226560 years of age and ineligible for, or declined, conventional combination chemotherapy. The ongoing study reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 82% in 11 evaluable patients, and BV appears to be well tolerated in this population (Friedberg 2018). The combination of BV and nivolumab produced a 67% complete response (CR) rate and an estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 77% in 93 patients with R/R cHL treated in the first-line salvage setting (Advani 2021). BV plus doxorubicin and dacarbazine (AD) without radiation therapy was evaluated in 34 patients with non-bulky Stage I or II cHL. BV-AD treatment resulted in interim and end of treatment (EOT) CR rates of 94% and 97%, respectively. The 4-year PFS and overall survival (OS) estimates were 91% and 100%, respectively. Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) was low grade and only 1 patient had persistent PSN at the last follow-up (Abramson 2021). Part C of this study will evaluate BV, nivolumab, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (AN+AD) in patients with Stage I or II cHL without bulky disease, a patient population similar to that studied in Abramson 2021. Based on the results of the trials summarized above, it is reasonable to expect that the combination of AN+AD will result in high response rates and be well tolerated, with potentially less toxicity compared with A+AVD.\n Study Design and Methods\n SGN35-027 (NCT03646123) is an open-label, multiple part, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial of BV in patients with Stage III or IV cHL evaluating the efficacy and safety of A+AVD when administered with growth factor prophylaxis (Part A). Part B will evaluate the combination of AN+AD in patients with Stage I or II cHL with bulky mediastinal disease or Stage III or IV cHL. Part C will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of AN+AD in patients with Stage I or II cHL without bulky disease. The primary objective of Parts B and C is to estimate the CR rate at EOT in patients with treatment-na\u00efve cHL.\n Approximately 240 patients will be enrolled in this study: 40 in Part A, 50 in Part B, and 150 in Part C. Parts A and B have completed enrollment. Patients in Part C must have histologically confirmed cHL and have an ECOG performance status of \u22642. Patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL or prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors will be ineligible for enrollment. Patients in Part C will be treated with BV 1.2 mg/kg, nivolumab 240 mg, doxorubicin 25 mg/m 2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m 2, administered separately by intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in Part C will receive 4 cycles of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint is the CR rate at EOT with AN+AD in patients with previously untreated cHL. Duration of response, duration of complete response, event-free survival, PFS, ORR, and safety and tolerability of AN+AD will be evaluated as secondary endpoints. Efficacy will be assessed by PET/CT scans at Cycle 2 and EOT; disease response and progression for Part C will be assessed using the LYRIC modification of the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (Cheson 2014). Patients will be followed for disease progression and OS for 5 years. Safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics. The CR rate at EOT and its two-sided 95% confidence interval will be presented (Clopper 1934). Time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.\n Enrollment for Part C is ongoing in the US, with plans for global expansion.\n \n \n Flinn:\u2008MorphoSys: Consultancy, Other: All consultancy and research funding payments made to Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Research Funding;

            "abstract": "\n Background\n The majority of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL who relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, or who are not candidates for HSCT or CAR-T, have poor outcomes and need novel therapies (Crump 2017). Brentuximab vedotin (BV) was the first antibody-drug conjugate to be approved in multiple cancer types (Gauzy-Lazo 2020). The combination of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody, a protease-cleavable linker, and the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E drives the anticancer activity of BV by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sutherland 2006). Lenalidomide may enhance the activity of BV through immune-mediated mechanisms. In a phase 1 trial (NCT02086604) in which 37 patients with R/R DLBCL were treated with BV + lenalidomide, the objective response rate (ORR) was 56.7% (73.3% in CD30+ patients).

The clinical activity and manageable safety profiles of BV, lenalidomide, and rituximab as single agents provide a strong rationale for this combination in multiple relapsed and heavily pretreated patients with R/R DLBCL.\n Study Design and Methods\n ECHELON-3 (NCT04404283) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, multicenter phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy of BV versus placebo, in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab, in patients with R/R DLBCL.\n Key eligibility criteria will include patients \u226518 years of age with R/R DLBCL with an eligible subtype, \u22652 prior lines of systemic therapy and ineligible for stem cell transplant or CAR-T therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, fluorodeoxyglucose-avid disease by positron emission tomography (PET), and bidimensional measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm by computed tomography (CT). Patients with a history of another malignancy within the past 2 years, any uncontrolled Grade \u22653 infection, Grade \u22652 peripheral neuropathy, or previous exposure to BV or lenalidomide will not be eligible.\n After completing the safety run-in period, patients (n=400) will be randomized 1:1 to receive either BV (1.2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks [Q3W]) or placebo (intravenously Q3W) in combination with lenalidomide (20 mg orally daily) and rituximab (1400 mg subcutaneously Q3W from Cycle 2, with 375 mg/m 2 intravenously on Cycle 1 Day 1). Treatment may continue while there is clinical benefit (SD or better) without progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be stratified by CD30 expression (\u22651% [positive] vs <1% [negative]), prior allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant therapy (received or not), prior CAR-T therapy (received or not), and cell of origin (germinal center B-cell [GCB] or non-GCB).\n The dual primary endpoints are PFS per blinded independent central review (BICR) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and CD30+ populations. Key secondary endpoints are OS in the ITT and CD30+ populations, and ORR per BICR. Other secondary endpoints include CR rate, duration of objective response, and safety and tolerability of the combination. Disease response will be assessed by BICR and the investigator according to the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (Cheson 2014). Radiographic disease evaluations, including contrast-enhanced CT and PET, will be assessed at baseline, then every 6 weeks from randomization until Week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter. PET is not required after CR is achieved\n For the analyses of PFS per BICR, the stratified log-rank test will be used to compare PFS between the 2 treatment groups. Hazard ratios will be estimated using the stratified Cox regression model. PFS will also be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Similar methods will be used to estimate OS and other time-to-event efficacy endpoints.\n The study is currently enrolling and will be open in 16 countries.\n \n \n Bartlett:\u2008Merck: Research Funding; Kite, a Gilead Company: Research Funding; Janssen: Research Funding; Genentech: Research Funding; Forty Seven: Research Funding; Celgene: Research Funding; Bristol Myers Squibb: Research Funding; Autolus: Research Funding; Seagen: Consultancy, Research Funding; Roche/Genentech: Consultancy; ADC Therapeutics: Consultancy, Research Funding; Millennium: Research Funding; Pharmacyclics: Research Funding.

            "text": "\n Background\n The majority of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL who relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, or who are not candidates for HSCT or CAR-T, have poor outcomes and need novel therapies (Crump 2017). Brentuximab vedotin (BV) was the first antibody-drug conjugate to be approved in multiple cancer types (Gauzy-Lazo 2020). The combination of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody, a protease-cleavable linker, and the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E drives the anticancer activity of BV by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sutherland 2006). Lenalidomide may enhance the activity of BV through immune-mediated mechanisms. In a phase 1 trial (NCT02086604) in which 37 patients with R/R DLBCL were treated with BV + lenalidomide, the objective response rate (ORR) was 56.7% (73.3% in CD30+ patients). The median duration of remission was 13.2 months in patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and 11.7 months in patients with a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) >6 months.

Targeted delivery of MMAE to CD30-expressing cells is the primary mechanism of action of brentuximab vedotin (Sutherland 2006). Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cell. In addition, the direct cytotoxicity associated with brentuximab vedotin may be augmented by secondary effects, including the bystander effect (Li 2016) and several important immuno-oncology related effects, such as immunogenic cell death (Gardai 2015; Muller 2014) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (Oflazoglu 2007). Brentuximab vedotin has been approved for several indications, including the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of adults with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL).\n Given that CD30 expression has been shown to persist during treatment with brentuximab vedotin, and after treatment when patients have relapsed (Porpaczy 2013), there is rationale to support evaluation of brentuximab vedotin in a retreatment setting. Encouraging safety and antitumor activity were observed in a phase 1 study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00947856) of brentuximab vedotin retreatment in patients with relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) or sALCL. The objective response rate (ORR) for retreatment of cHL was 60% (12 of 20 evaluable patients) with a complete response (CR) rate of 30% (6 of 20 evaluable patients). For retreated sALCL, the ORR was 88% (7 of 8 patients) with a CR rate of 63% (5 of 8 patients). The estimated median duration of response (DOR) for patients with an objective response was 9.5 months, and for patients with a CR, the estimated median DOR was 12.3 months (Bartlett 2014). However, interpretation from this study is limited because it did not include patients who received brentuximab vedotin as part of frontline treatment or in patients with non-sALCL PTCL. The potential of retreatment with brentuximab vedotin to offer a meaningful treatment option throughout the continuum of these diseases is under investigation.\n Study Design and Methods\n This is a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL, sALCL, or other CD30-expressing PTCL who experienced CR or partial response with a brentuximab vedotin-containing regimen and subsequently experienced disease progression or relapse. Patients who previously discontinued brentuximab vedotin due to any Grade 3 or higher toxicity or have existing Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy will not be eligible. It is anticipated that approximately 50 patients will enroll in this study.\n All patients will be administered 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin intravenously, up to a maximum of 180 mg, over 30 minutes once per 21-day cycle. Patients who previously required a dose reduction due to adverse events (AE) will be administered brentuximab vedotin at 1.2 mg/kg.\n The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is ORR (per blinded independent central review), a direct measure of anti-tumor activity. To further assess the significance of ORR in this study, durability, CR rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.

            "abstract": "Background Mature T/NK-cell lymphomas comprise a subset of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Some of these subtypes are known to express CD30, including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) where CD30 expression is pathognomonic. Few advances have occurred in the frontline treatment of sALCL and other T-cell lymphomas over the past 30 years, with treatment typically consisting of anthracycline-containing regimens such as CHOP. Overall outcomes with frontline therapy are poor, with a complete remission (CR) rate of 39\u201353% (Reimer 2009; D\u2019Amore 2012) and a 5-year overall survival rate of 12\u201349%, depending on subtype (Vose 2008). Brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u00ae) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, covalently attached to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker. Efficacy was demonstrated in a pivotal phase 2 study of relapsed sALCL pts, where an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% and a CR rate of 57% were observed (Pro 2012). Methods A total of 39 pts were enrolled in this phase 1, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin administered sequentially with standard-dose CHOP or in combination with CHP (CHOP without vincristine) (A+CHP) for the frontline treatment of sALCL and other CD30+ mature T/NK-cell lymphomas (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01309789). ALK+ sALCL pts were required to have an IPI score \u22652. Pts in Arm 1 received sequential treatment (q3wk): 2 cycles of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin followed by 6 cycles of CHOP. Arm 2 was designed to determine the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in A+CHP to be evaluated in Arm 3 (6 cycles q3wk). Responders were eligible to receive single-agent brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg q3wk) for 8\u201310 additional cycles (16 total cycles) in all 3 arms. Results On Arm 1, 13 pts received sequential treatment with brentuximab vedotin and CHOP. Pts had a median age of 62 years (range, 23\u201381). All pts were diagnosed with sALCL (10 ALK\u2013). Following initial treatment with single-agent brentuximab vedotin, 13 pts (100%) achieved an objective response (CR rate 38%). At the end of subsequent treatment with CHOP, 11 of 13 pts (85%) achieved an objective response (CR rate 62%). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (\u226540%) included peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, constipation, and peripheral edema. TEAEs with a severity \u2265 Grade 3 (\u226510%) included febrile neutropenia, anemia, neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, and fatigue. Following sequential treatment, 12 of 13 pts remained on-treatment and received single-agent brentuximab vedotin. After a median observation time of 23 months, the 1-year PFS rate was 77% (95% CI 44, 92). The remaining 26 pts received combination treatment with A+CHP on Arms 2 and 3. The median age of pts was 56 years (range, 21\u201382). sALCL was diagnosed in 19 pts (16 ALK\u2013). Other diagnoses included peripheral T-cell lymphoma-NOS (n=2), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n=2), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (n=2), and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (n=1). The maximum tolerated dose of brentuximab vedotin in A+CHP was not exceeded at 1.8 mg/kg IV, based on 1 DLT (Grade 3 rash). 23 of 26 pts completed 6 cycles of A+CHP; 21 of these pts went on to receive subsequent single-agent brentuximab vedotin treatment. The median number of brentuximab vedotin cycles, including combination treatment and subsequent monotherapy, was 13 (range, 3\u201316). TEAEs (\u226540%) included peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, alopecia, and dyspnea. TEAEs with a severity \u2265 Grade 3 (\u226510%) included febrile neutropenia, anemia, and neutropenia. All 26 pts were assessed for a clinical response at the end of treatment with A+CHP. The ORR was 100%, with a CR rate of 88%. All 7 non-ALCL pts achieved a CR. After a median observation time of 16 months, the 1-year PFS rate was 71% (95% CI 49, 85). Conclusions At a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, brentuximab vedotin, administered sequentially with CHOP or in combination with CHP, exhibited manageable toxicity in the treatment of newly-diagnosed CD30+ mature T/NK-cell lymphomas. A+CHP exhibited substantial antitumor activity, with an ORR of 100% (CR rate 88%) and a 1-year PFS rate of 71%. A phase 3 study comparing A+CHP to CHOP in the frontline treatment of mature T-cell lymphomas is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01777152).

            "text": "Background Mature T/NK-cell lymphomas comprise a subset of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Some of these subtypes are known to express CD30, including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) where CD30 expression is pathognomonic. Few advances have occurred in the frontline treatment of sALCL and other T-cell lymphomas over the past 30 years, with treatment typically consisting of anthracycline-containing regimens such as CHOP. Overall outcomes with frontline therapy are poor, with a complete remission (CR) rate of 39\u201353% (Reimer 2009; D\u2019Amore 2012) and a 5-year overall survival rate of 12\u201349%, depending on subtype (Vose 2008). Brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u00ae) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, covalently attached to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker. Efficacy was demonstrated in a pivotal phase 2 study of relapsed sALCL pts, where an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% and a CR rate of 57% were observed (Pro 2012). Methods A total of 39 pts were enrolled in this phase 1, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin administered sequentially with standard-dose CHOP or in combination with CHP (CHOP without vincristine) (A+CHP) for the frontline treatment of sALCL and other CD30+ mature T/NK-cell lymphomas (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01309789). ALK+ sALCL pts were required to have an IPI score \u22652. Pts in Arm 1 received sequential treatment (q3wk): 2 cycles of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin followed by 6 cycles of CHOP. Arm 2 was designed to determine the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in A+CHP to be evaluated in Arm 3 (6 cycles q3wk). Responders were eligible to receive single-agent brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg q3wk) for 8\u201310 additional cycles (16 total cycles) in all 3 arms.

A self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) spacer between the dipeptides and the DOX was required for rapid and quantitative generation of free drug. DOX release from model substrate Z-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX 49 was 30-fold faster than from Z-Val-Cit-PABC-DOX 42 with the cysteine protease cathepsin B alone, but rates were identical in a rat liver lysosomal preparation suggesting the participation of more than one enzyme. Conjugates 72 and 73 showed rapid and near quantitative drug release with cathepsin B and in a lysosomal preparation, while demonstrating excellent stability in human plasma. Against tumor cell lines with varying levels of BR96 expression, both conjugates showed potent, antigen-specific cytotoxic activity, suggesting that they will be effective in delivering DOX selectively to antigen-expressing carcinomas."

Increasing the steric hindrance of a linker (e.g., SPDB-DM4 linker payload construct) can enhance the stability of the ADC in circulation, with the aim of reducing non-specific toxicities. Cleavable linkers are mostly cleaved from the payload in endosomes or lysosomal compartments via a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones); protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide); thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (disulfide, carbonate). Conversely, non-cleavable linkers (MC and SMCC) require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody, generating a toxic payload with charged lysines or cysteines (Table 1).",

Increasing the steric hindrance of a linker (e.g., SPDB-DM4 linker payload construct) can enhance the stability of the ADC in circulation, with the aim of reducing non-specific toxicities. Cleavable linkers are mostly cleaved from the payload in endosomes or lysosomal compartments via a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones); protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide); thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (disulfide, carbonate). Conversely, non-cleavable linkers (MC and SMCC) require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody, generating a toxic payload with charged lysines or cysteines (Table 1)."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action.

In the past, patients affected by the so called HER2-positive breast cancer had lower probabilities of cure and survival, though with the advent of drugs that target HER2, three decades ago, their prognosis has greatly improved. So far, only patients with strong HER2 expression on their tumour can be treated with these benefitial drugs, like trastuzumab, though recently stronger drugs have also been shown capable of eliminating breast cancer cells with lower levels of HER2 expression (HER2-low). Sooner or later, these new drugs, like trastuzumab-deruxtecan, may be available for treating such patients. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review of the literature is to provide an outline of what is going on on this specific field of research, and what could be expected in the future in the clinic. Abstract Since human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) characterization, going through clinical research and regulatory approval of HER2-targeted therapies, much has elapsed and is still unfolding. Hitherto, only breast cancer (BC) patients with HER2 immunohistochemistry 3+ or with HER2 gene fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) amplification (a.k.a., HER2-positive BC) have benefited from anti-HER2 agents. In recent years, however, much of the research effort has been expanded, with positive outcomes being reached for formerly known HER2-negative BC that yet express HER2 to some degree (HER2 immunohistochemistry 1+ or 2+, but FISH negative) and are currently being classified as HER2-low BC for the purpose of trial enrollment. In this sense, our aim is to review the body of evidence of HER2-low BC that led to the study of first-generation anti-HER2 agents, like trastuzumab, and how they have failed to achieve any clinical applicability in this setting. In addition, we review new data that is leading to the growing success of the new generation of drugs, especially the promising HER2-directed antibody\u2013drug conjugates. A narrative review is also performed regarding the rationale behind the consolidated and ongoing clinical trials studying anti-HER2 agents in combination with unrelated agents, such as immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Hopefully, all this ongoing research effort will be able to extend the survival benefits seen with anti-HER2 agents in HER2-positive disease, at least to some degree, to the greater proportion of patients with HER2-low BC."

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action. This article reviews non-cleavable linkers applied predominantly in Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), and how they influence these conjugates in terms of ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) and safety.",

Here, we examine the stability of a non-cleavable Amino-PEG6-based linker bearing the monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) payload site-specifically conjugated at multiple positions on an antibody. Enzymatic conjugation with transglutaminase allows us to create a stable amide linkage that remains intact across all tested conjugation sites on the antibody, and provides us with an opportunity to examine the stability of the auristatin payload itself. We report a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD in rodent plasma that has a detrimental effect on its potency. The MMAD cleavage can be eliminated by either modifying the C terminus of the toxin, or by selection of conjugation site. Both approaches result in improved stability and potency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the MMAD metabolism in mouse plasma is likely mediated by a serine-based hydrolase, appears much less pronounced in rat, and was not detected in cynomolgus monkey or human plasma. Clarifying these species differences and controlling toxin degradation to optimize ADC stability in rodents is essential to make the best ADC selection from preclinical models. The data presented here demonstrate that site selection and toxin susceptibility to mouse plasma degradation are important considerations in the design of non-cleavable ADCs, and further highlight the benefits of site-specific conjugation methods."

Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity....Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC.",

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

A self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) spacer between the dipeptides and the DOX was required for rapid and quantitative generation of free drug. DOX release from model substrate Z-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX 49 was 30-fold faster than from Z-Val-Cit-PABC-DOX 42 with the cysteine protease cathepsin B alone, but rates were identical in a rat liver lysosomal preparation suggesting the participation of more than one enzyme. Conjugates 72 and 73 showed rapid and near quantitative drug release with cathepsin B and in a lysosomal preparation, while demonstrating excellent stability in human plasma. Against tumor cell lines with varying levels of BR96 expression, both conjugates showed potent, antigen-specific cytotoxic activity, suggesting that they will be effective in delivering DOX selectively to antigen-expressing carcinomas."

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs."

Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

Our lead agent, SGN-35, consists of the cAC10 antibody linked to the N-terminal amino acid of monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline p-aminobenzylcarbamate (val-cit-PABC) linker that is cleaved by intracellular proteases such as cathepsin B. More recently, we developed an auristatin F (AF) derivative monomethylauristatin F (MMAF), which unlike MMAE contains the amino acid phenylalanine at the C-terminal position. Because of the negatively charged C-terminal residue, the potency of AF and MMAF is impaired. However, their ability to kill target cells is greatly enhanced through facilitated cellular uptake by internalizing mAbs. Here, we explore the effects of linker technology on AF-based ADC potency, activity, and tolerability by generating a diverse set of dipeptide linkers between the C-terminal residue and the mAb carrier. The resulting ADCs differed widely in activity, with some having significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the original mAb-Val-Cit-PABC-MMAF conjugate. The therapeutic index was increased yet further by generating dipeptide-based ADCs utilizing new auristatins with methionine or tryptophan as the C-terminal drug residue. These results demonstrate that manipulation of the C-terminal peptide sequence used to attach auristatins to the mAb carrier can lead to highly potent and specific conjugates with greatly improved therapeutic windows."

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies.",

Moreover, this review also shed light on the current status of ADCs that have gained regulatory approval from the FDA including a description of biology and chemistry, metabolic profiles, adverse events, drug interactions, and the future perspective on combination strategies with other agents, including immunotherapy."

To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.",

Herein, we conducted a review of the history and general mechanism of action of ADCs, and then briefly discussed the molecular aspects of key components of ADCs and the mechanisms by which these key factors influence the activities of ADCs. Moreover, we also reviewed the approved ADCs and other promising candidates in phase-3 clinical trials and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives for the development of next generations, which provide insights for the research and development of novel cancer therapeutics using ADCs."

MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices.",

Monoclonal antibodies against antigens on cancer cells offer an alternative tumor-selective treatment approach. However, most monoclonal antibodies are not sufficiently potent to be therapeutically active on their own. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use antibodies to deliver a potent cytotoxic compound selectively to tumor cells, thus improving the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents. The recent approval of two ADCs, brentuximab vedotin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, for cancer treatment has spurred tremendous research interest in this field. This Review touches upon the early efforts in the field, and describes how the lessons learned from the first-generation ADCs have led to improvements in every aspect of this technology, i.e., the antibody, the cytotoxic compound, and the linker connecting them, leading to the current successes. The design of ADCs currently in clinical development, and results from mechanistic studies and preclinical and clinical evaluation are discussed. Emerging technologies that seek to further advance this exciting area of research are also discussed."

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."

This suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

At the core of ADC design is the linker, which serves as the critical bridge between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload. Linkers are categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nCleavable linkers are designed to release their cytotoxic payload upon exposure to specific conditions within or around tumor cells. These conditions may include acidic pH (found in lysosomes), specific enzymes (such as cathepsins or proteases), or reducing environments (with high glutathione concentrations). Common examples include hydrazone linkers (pH-sensitive), dipeptide linkers (enzyme-cleavable), and disulfide linkers (reduction-sensitive). The deliberate release mechanism allows the payload to be freed from the antibody once internalized into the target cell. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, in contrast, maintain a covalent bond between the payload and antibody components even after internalization. For these ADCs, payload release typically requires complete proteolytic degradation of the antibody portion within the lysosome, leaving the payload attached to an amino acid residue. This inherent difference in release mechanism creates distinct pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles compared to cleavable linkers. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe linker design significantly influences an ADC's stability in circulation, which directly impacts its therapeutic window and toxicity profile. Cleavable linkers may be more susceptible to premature release of the cytotoxic payload in circulation, potentially leading to off-target effects and systemic toxicities. Non-cleavable linkers generally demonstrate greater plasma stability but may have different efficacy profiles due to their distinct release mechanisms. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17](Drago et al., 2021)(Lu et al., 2016)."

Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload.

In some cases, this degradation does not lead to a complete separation of the payload from the antibody, so residues of the antibody can remain attached to the drug molecule.

Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation (Frigerio et al., 2018). In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 (Goeij et al., 2016). This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity."

                            "Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) are one of the fastest growing anticancer drugs. This approach comprises a mAb conjugated to the cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker that directed toward a target antigen expressed on the cancer cell surface, reducing systemic exposure and therefore toxicity. ADCs are complex molecules that require careful attention to various components. Selection of an appropriate target, an mAb, cytotoxic payload, and the manner in which the antibody is linked to the payload are key determinants of the safety and efficacy of ADCs. This review provides an overview of the systemic evaluation of each component of an ADC design, improved understanding of the mechanism of action of ADC, and mechanistic pathways involved in ADC resistance and various strategies to optimize ADC design. Moreover, this review also shed light on the current status of ADCs that have gained regulatory approval from the FDA including a description of biology and chemistry, metabolic profiles, adverse events, drug interactions, and the future perspective on combination strategies with other agents, including immunotherapy."

                            "Traditional cancer chemotherapy is often accompanied by systemic toxicity to the patient. Monoclonal antibodies against antigens on cancer cells offer an alternative tumor-selective treatment approach. However, most monoclonal antibodies are not sufficiently potent to be therapeutically active on their own. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use antibodies to deliver a potent cytotoxic compound selectively to tumor cells, thus improving the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents. The recent approval of two ADCs, brentuximab vedotin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, for cancer treatment has spurred tremendous research interest in this field. This Review touches upon the early efforts in the field, and describes how the lessons learned from the first-generation ADCs have led to improvements in every aspect of this technology, i.e., the antibody, the cytotoxic compound, and the linker connecting them, leading to the current successes. The design of ADCs currently in clinical development, and results from mechanistic studies and preclinical and clinical evaluation are discussed. Emerging technologies that seek to further advance this exciting area of research are also discussed."

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            ".Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

                            "Linkers bind the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect."

This suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

                            "As one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."

This difference stems from the ability of developing neutrophils to secrete proteases that can cleave dipeptide linkers like ValCit, releasing toxic payloads that damage these developing blood cells. (3 sources)",
                "text": "\nNeutropenia, characterized by abnormally low neutrophil counts, represents one of the most clinically relevant and dose-limiting toxicities associated with ADC therapy. Evidence strongly indicates that the choice of linker significantly influences the incidence and severity of this hematological toxicity.\n\nADCs employing cleavable linkers, particularly those with valine-citrulline (ValCit) dipeptide linkers conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), demonstrate a clear association with neutropenia in clinical settings. In contrast, patients treated with ADCs using non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (mc) linkers conjugated to monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) typically experience substantially lower rates of neutropenia <Paper corpusId=\"10729763\" paperTitle=\"(Drake et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256374060\" paperTitle=\"(Drake et al._1, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe underlying mechanism for this differential toxicity has been elucidated through experimental research. While mature neutrophils show resistance to both cleavable and non-cleavable ADCs, developing neutrophils display selective vulnerability to cleavable linker constructs. This vulnerability stems from their production of elastase, a serine protease capable of cleaving the ValCit peptide linker, thereby releasing the free cytotoxic payload. The liberated payload can then exert its cytotoxic effects on these developing neutrophils, explaining the clinical observation of neutropenia <Paper corpusId=\"10729763\" paperTitle=\"(Drake et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256374060\" paperTitle=\"(Drake et al._1, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent comprehensive analyses of ADC toxicity profiles have further confirmed the association between linker type and neutropenia risk. When controlling for other variables such as drug-antibody ratio (DAR), non-cleavable linkers remain significantly and independently associated with lower rates of grade \u22653 neutropenia (p = 0.021) compared to cleavable linkers. However, when adjustments are made for systemic free payload concentration, the significant independent association between linker type and neutropenia diminishes, suggesting that the primary driver of neutropenia is the concentration of free cytotoxic payload in circulation <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis finding aligns with the mechanistic understanding that cleavable linkers, particularly those with enzymatically cleavable sites like the ValCit dipeptide, can be prematurely cleaved in circulation or within non-target tissues containing relevant proteases. The resulting release of free payload increases systemic exposure to the cytotoxic agent, leading to collateral damage to sensitive developing neutrophils in the bone marrow.",

Non-cleavable linker ADCs demonstrate superior plasma stability compared to their cleavable counterparts, resulting in longer circulation half-lives and reduced systemic toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced stability directly translates to a wider therapeutic window\u2014the range between effective and toxic doses\u2014offering greater safety margins in clinical settings <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe fundamental mechanism underlying these differences lies in the release kinetics of the cytotoxic payload. Cleavable linkers are susceptible to premature cleavage in circulation, leading to the release of free drug or toxic metabolites into the bloodstream before reaching target tissues <Paper corpusId=\"260262995\" paperTitle=\"(Hurwitz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This premature release can cause significant off-target effects as lipophilic payloads can readily enter non-targeted cells through membrane diffusion <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers maintain the connection between antibody and payload until the entire complex is internalized and degraded within lysosomes, significantly reducing the risk of systemic payload exposure <Paper corpusId=\"268574267\" paperTitle=\"(Shih et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis difference in systemic toxicity has been demonstrated in controlled experimental settings. In target-independent safety studies in rats, non-cleavable linker ADCs showed markedly reduced toxicity compared to cleavable linker counterparts, directly attributed to decreased release of free drug into circulation <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Specifically, while ADCs with cleavable linkers lost their drug payload more quickly in circulation, non-cleavable linker conjugates maintained payload attachment with kinetics similar to the total antibody, resulting in less systemic exposure to free cytotoxic agents <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe stability of the linker has been shown to significantly influence the ADC's toxicity profile, with the most stable linkers releasing the chemotherapeutic component only in a target-specific manner, while less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, FDA analysis of Phase I study data noted that ADCs utilizing the same linker but targeting different antigens exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the critical role of linker selection in determining overall safety <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"392811\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, the enhanced safety profile of non-cleavable linkers comes with potential trade-offs in efficacy. In a comparative study by Polson et al., ADCs with cleavable linkers demonstrated efficacy against all seven non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigen targets tested, while non-cleavable linker ADCs were effective against only two targets <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This difference in efficacy may be attributed to the limited ability of non-cleavable linker ADCs to produce a \"bystander effect\"\u2014the phenomenon where released payloads can diffuse into neighboring tumor cells, potentially enhancing anti-tumor efficacy in heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNon-cleavable linker ADCs are particularly advantageous for tumors with homogeneous antigen expression, where the primary targeting mechanism is sufficient <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, cleavable linker ADCs may offer advantages for tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression, where the bystander effect can compensate for variable target expression <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this same mechanism that enhances efficacy also contributes to the increased systemic toxicity observed with cleavable linker ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers thus represents a critical decision point in ADC design, requiring careful balancing of stability, payload release efficiency, bystander effects, and potential systemic toxicities to optimize the therapeutic window for specific clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"269694298\" paperTitle=\"(Grammoustianou et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"273542597\" paperTitle=\"(Bian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2).

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            ".Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates utilize the antibody as a delivery vehicle for highly potent cytotoxic molecules with specificity for tumor-associated antigens for cancer therapy. Critical parameters that govern successful antibody-drug conjugate development for clinical use include the selection of the tumor target antigen, the antibody against the target, the cytotoxic molecule, the linker bridging the cytotoxic molecule and the antibody, and the conjugation chemistry used for the attachment of the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. Advancements in these core antibody-drug conjugate technology are reflected by recent approval of Adectris\u00ae (anti-CD30-drug conjugate) and Kadcyla\u00ae (anti-HER2 drug conjugate). The potential approval of an anti-CD22 conjugate and promising new clinical data for anti-CD19 and anti-CD33 conjugates are additional advancements. Enrichment of antibody-drug conjugates with newly developed potent cytotoxic molecules and linkers are also in the pipeline for various tumor targets. However, the complexity of antibody-drug conjugate components, conjugation methods, and off-target toxicities still pose challenges for the strategic design of antibody-drug conjugates to achieve their fullest therapeutic potential. This review will discuss the emergence of clinical antibody-drug conjugates, current trends in optimization strategies, and recent study results for antibody-drug conjugates that have incorporated the latest optimization strategies. Future challenges and perspectives toward making antibody-drug conjugates more amendable for broader disease indications are also discussed."

                            "ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

Non-cleavable linkers offer greater safety profiles for homogeneous tumors, while cleavable linkers may provide advantages for heterogeneous tumors despite increased toxicity risks. (16 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe consistent toxicity differences between cleavable and non-cleavable linker ADCs have significant implications for clinical decision-making and therapeutic development. Non-cleavable linker ADCs have emerged as particularly advantageous for improving the therapeutic window\u2014the range between effective and toxic doses\u2014due to their enhanced plasma stability and reduced systemic toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis improved stability stems from the fundamental mechanism of non-cleavable linkers, which require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody portion to release their cytotoxic payloads <Paper corpusId=\"17278582\" paperTitle=\"(Donaghy, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Unlike cleavable linkers that can undergo premature cleavage in circulation, non-cleavable linkers maintain the connection between antibody and payload until the entire complex is internalized and degraded within lysosomes <Paper corpusId=\"257644925\" paperTitle=\"(Esapa et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism significantly reduces the risk of premature payload release in circulation, leading to decreased off-target toxicity and a potentially larger therapeutic window <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe therapeutic considerations for selecting between linker types must account for both safety and efficacy profiles. Non-cleavable linker ADCs are particularly well-suited for tumors with homogeneous antigen expression, where the primary targeting mechanism is sufficient <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their greater stability in circulation and reduced risk of systemic toxicity make them especially valuable when treating sensitive patient populations or when trying to minimize specific adverse events like neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy <Paper corpusId=\"258877766\" paperTitle=\"(Lim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nConversely, cleavable linkers offer distinct advantages for treating tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression due to their ability to produce a \"bystander effect\"\u2014where released payloads can diffuse into neighboring tumor cells <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This phenomenon can enhance anti-tumor efficacy by affecting antigen-negative cells within the tumor microenvironment <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this same mechanism also contributes to the increased systemic toxicity observed with cleavable linker ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"269587315\" paperTitle=\"(Takakura et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe trade-off between efficacy and toxicity is clearly demonstrated in comparative studies. In research by Polson et al., ADCs with cleavable linkers demonstrated efficacy against all seven non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigen targets tested, while non-cleavable linker ADCs were effective against only two targets. However, at equivalent doses, the animals treated with cleavable linker ADCs exhibited significantly more weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent ADC development has increasingly recognized these differential toxicity profiles, with non-cleavable linkers being favored in situations where systemic toxicity is a primary concern <Paper corpusId=\"273007274\" paperTitle=\"(Alexander et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The superior safety profile of non-cleavable linkers, particularly their reduced association with neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy, has led to their increasing adoption in newer ADC designs <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFuture therapeutic considerations may include context-specific selection of linker types based on tumor characteristics, patient comorbidities, and prior treatment history. For tumors with known heterogeneous antigen expression, the bystander effect of cleavable linkers may provide efficacy advantages that outweigh toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"276588757\" paperTitle=\"(Yamanaka et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, for patients with pre-existing neuropathy or hematological vulnerabilities, the reduced toxicity profile of non-cleavable linkers may be preferred <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nUltimately, the selection between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers represents a critical decision point in ADC design, requiring careful balancing of stability, payload release efficiency, bystander effects, and potential systemic toxicities to optimize the therapeutic window for specific clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Increasing the steric hindrance of a linker (e.g., SPDB-DM4 linker payload construct) can enhance the stability of the ADC in circulation, with the aim of reducing non-specific toxicities. Cleavable linkers are mostly cleaved from the payload in endosomes or lysosomal compartments via a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones); protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide); thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (disulfide, carbonate).

Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation (Frigerio et al., 2018). In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 (Goeij et al., 2016). This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity."

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            ".Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

                            "Conjugates of the anti-CanAg humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 with the microtubule-formation inhibitor DM1 (a maytansinoid), or with the DNA alkylator DC1 (a CC1065 analogue), have been evaluated for their ability to eradicate mixed cell populations formed from CanAg-positive and CanAg-negative cells in culture and in xenograft tumors in mice. We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

Whereas these features of non-cleavable linkers offer less toxicity, bystander effect is not expected because of the extremely low cell membrane permeability."

This suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016)."

Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect."

                            "As one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."
