Apolipoprotein was the most abundant plasma proteins in the protein corona of all the tested cNPs, whereas the complement proteins were found in high abundance in the protein corona of cNP1 and cNP3. The protein corona of cNP1 showed a high abundance of coagulation proteins and tissue leakage proteins, while the corona of cNP3 showed a high abundance of acute phase proteins (Fig. 6C). We further identified and semiquantitatively analyzed the 20 most abundant proteins among the approximately 100 different of proteins isolated from the corona of cNP1-cNP4. The results were summarized in a heat map in Fig. 6D. The heat map showed several aspects of the cNPs' protein corona. Notably, the coronas of all four cNPs contained relatively small amounts of serum albumin (10% or less) which is the most abundant protein in plasma (more than 50%) [34,35]. As serum albumin has a structure similar to surfactants (hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell), serum albumin is considered to be more stable in water than on the cNPs' surface [30]. Therefore, the serum albumin content in the cNPs' protein corona was much less than that in plasma.

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

Coverage with albumin has been shown to reduce the lysosomal degradation of nanoparticles in endothelial cells and, therefore, extend the circulation time of particles [47,71]. Furthermore, albumin facilitates transport of nanoparticles from the site of injection to peripheral tissues [60], endocytosis [72] and transcytosis across capillary endothelium [73]. In addition, other plasma proteins involved in binding, transport, and mediating availability of various biomolecules in the bloodstream (e.g., apolipoproteins, \u03b1-2-HS-glycoprotein (also known as fetuin-A), serotransferrin etc.) and proteins involved in blood coagulation and haemostasis (e.g., \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin etc.) were identified in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles. Moreover, contact activation pathway of coagulation can be activated by artificial negatively-charged substances, including oligonucleotides, \"naked\" pDNA and anionic nanoparticles that may explain the presence of coagulation proteins in protein corona of CPP-pDNA nanoparticles [74,75].\n\nFetuin found in the protein corona has been demonstrated earlier to trigger internalisation of nanoparticles, e.g., the uptake of nanospheres by Kupffer cells through the scavenger receptors [76].

Conjugation of LNPs with macromolecules, such as GALA peptide (a 30 amino acid synthetic peptide with a glutamic acid-alanine-leucine-alanine repeat) [178], or antibodies, such as anti-plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein [179], has demonstrated preferential delivery of LNPs to the lungs after intravenous administration. Importantly, LNPs interact with proteins in the blood and incorporate them onto their surfaces, forming a targeting ligand coat of serum proteins called a protein corona. This protein corona can cause unexpected tissue localization of LNPs even when formulated to be organ-specific with the SORT methodology as certain host serum proteins also contribute to organ targeting. Qiu et al. demonstrated that by altering the linker structure in the lipidoid tails of SORT LNPs, the composition of the serum proteins that are incorporated into the protein corona can be manipulated to shift the LNPs towards lung-specific delivery [180].",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. 61,64,65 Yan et al. demonstrated the hepatic clearance of liposomes via ApoE as a ligand\u2212receptormediated uptake process using ApoE-deficient mice. 61 LNPs also passively accumulate in the liver as a consequence of physiology since the liver is a highly perfused organ with fenestrated capillaries. 65 his endogenous ligand\u2212receptor-mediated targeting suggests that similar approaches using exogenous ligands may be useful for LNP targeting to different cell and tissue types. 65,66 or example, the PEG-conjugated ligand anisamide interacts with sigma receptors expressed by murine melanoma cells (B16F10) and has been used to increase LNP-mediated siRNA delivery to lung tumors and metastases. 67 However, the efficacy of anisamide for LNP targeting may be limited by the subcellular organization of sigma receptors and the impact of anisamide on LNP endocytosis. 68 n other studies, incorporating small-molecule ligands into LNP formulations has enabled particle targeting and improved cellular uptake. The small-molecule ligand strophanthidin has been incorporated in LNP formulations to improve in vitro transfection of cells derived from different tissue types.",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

These results confirmed the efficacy of the lyophilization technique for long-term preservation and storage of these polylipoic particles.   Interaction with Serum/Plasma Proteins. The formation of a hard corona, a set of strongly bound biomolecules on the surface of NPs, is a possible source of interfering effects and adverse reactions in biological environments.\n\nThe protein corona has been indeed reported to affect cell interactions and the targeting selectivity of nanoparticles. 48 In addition, some NP-bound proteins could favor inflammatory or procoagulant effects and the clearance by RES macrophages, especially the liver Kupfer cells. 49 According to the most recent literature, polymer coating in many cases does not prevent protein binding, but controls the selective recruitment of a small pool of proteins that are, in turn, responsible for the nanoparticle's properties. 50\u221253 The protein corona formed on our nanoparticles was investigated using SDS-PAGE analysis followed by sensitive silver staining. The experiment revealed that F127@7-NPs, preincubated with human serum (HS) up to quasiphysiological concentrations (50% v/v), were virtually free of bound serum proteins upon few washes in protein-free PBS ( Figure 7A, left panel). The extent of protein association to poly(lipoic acid) nanoparticles after incubation with human plasma, human serum, and FCS was not dissimilar, or even reduced, compared to the one observed with 50:50 poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs (average size 95 nm, PDI 0.27 measured by DLS), functionalized with PEG 5000 , used as a regulatory-approved NP benchmark 57 (Figures S23 and S24).

            "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the finding that other cationic helper lipids (EPC and DDAB) within such LNPs cause similar protein expression in the pancreas (Melamed et al., 2023). For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

            "text": "By adjusting the ratio of lipids in LNPs, the targeting ability of LNPs to different organs can be tailored. Siegwart et al. [62] discovered that modifying the composition and components of LNPs allows for the selective targeting of organs. These passively targeted LNPs are termed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, facilitating controlled nucleic acid delivery to specific tissues. Lung-targeting SORT LNPs feature a notably different protein corona from liver-targeting LNPs, with a reduced enrichment of ApoE, complement components, and immunoglobulins as well as increased enrichment of vitronectin (Vtn) among other proteins [63] (Figure 4). SORT LNPs contain SORT molecules and can accurately regulate delivery to the mouse liver, lungs, and spleen after intravenous injection [64] (Table 2). Siegwart et al. [65] conducted an exploration of the targeted mechanism of SORT LNPs. They speculated that different SORT molecules may cause LNPs to absorb different plasma proteins, thereby achieving tissue-specific mRNA delivery. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona of different SORT LNPs revealed that the main proteins adsorbed by LNPs from the liver, lungs, and spleen were apolipoprotein E (apoE), vitronectin, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I, respectively. This suggests the potential to elucidate the targeting mechanism in extrahepatic tissues. Flux screening represents another method for developing tissue-specific LNPs. Dahlman et al. [66] developed a research strategy called the Joint Rapid DNA Analysis of Nanoparticles, utilizing DNA barcodes and sequencing techniques. This strategy enables the high-throughput screening of LNP formulations by encapsulating unique DNA sequences. Each LNP formulation is associated with a unique DNA barcode sequence. Using flow cytometry and nextgeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67]. \n\ngeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67].",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

This analysis showed that the differences in the composition of the cNPs' protein corona were driven by a combination of the nanoparticles' surface functional groups and the proteins' physiological function. Apolipoprotein was the most abundant plasma proteins in the protein corona of all the tested cNPs, whereas the complement proteins were found in high abundance in the protein corona of cNP1 and cNP3. The protein corona of cNP1 showed a high abundance of coagulation proteins and tissue leakage proteins, while the corona of cNP3 showed a high abundance of acute phase proteins (Fig. 6C). We further identified and semiquantitatively analyzed the 20 most abundant proteins among the approximately 100 different of proteins isolated from the corona of cNP1-cNP4. The results were summarized in a heat map in Fig. 6D. The heat map showed several aspects of the cNPs' protein corona. Notably, the coronas of all four cNPs contained relatively small amounts of serum albumin (10% or less) which is the most abundant protein in plasma (more than 50%) [34,35]. As serum albumin has a structure similar to surfactants (hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell), serum albumin is considered to be more stable in water than on the cNPs' surface [30]. Therefore, the serum albumin content in the cNPs' protein corona was much less than that in plasma. Macroglobulin, the second most abundant plasma protein [35], was only the 7-11th most abundant protein detectable on the corona of cNP1-cNP3.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Most nanoparticle-based formulations have been designed for intravenous administration to spread deeper to organ tissue without surgery. These nanovectors interact with the biological system, mainly with the circulatory proteins, upon being available into the systemic circulation. One set of proteins binds with nanoparticles' surface and forms a protein corona (PC) conjugate. After adhering, this PC makes the particles recognized by the innate immune system followed by quicker elimination by phagocytic cells present in the liver, lungs, and spleen. Additionally, these PCs increase the physical disability and agglomeration of particles. To overcome this problem, the utmost requirement is to develop new strategies to minimize PC formation with improved stability and circulatory time of nanovectors (Rampado et al., 2020). The composition and kinetics of PC vary (decrease or increase) over time. It was believed that the PCs are responsible for the instability of NPs. However, a separate study demonstrated the aggregation of nanoparticles inversely proportion with protein [human serum albumin (HSA), fibrinogen, immunoglobulin, and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)] concentration (Ho et al., 2018). It was observed that NPs aggregation was increased at lower protein concentrations, whereas these NPs were stable at higher protein concentrations. The interaction of the protein with the nanoparticles is varied based on the type of protein. \n\nImmunoglobulin and fibrinogens are sticky proteins either form clotting or bind with foreign bodies, whereas HAS and APOA1 interact with more NPs simultaneously to form bridges. \n\nThe concentration and tagged surfactants charged on NPs determine the PC characters (Zhang et al., 2019). Charges on NPs were changed after the formation of PC. Particles with negative charge persisted, whereas positively charged particles acquired a negative charge. Ovisprin-1 and lysozyme protein coronas were tested on plain gold nanoparticles to understand the protein corona formation in an aqueous environment (Jahan Sajib et al., 2020). It was observed that the appearance of PC is caused due to protein-protein interaction and protein's surface and hydrophobic surface effect.",

            "text": "LSNPs. To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles. These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo. We first compared the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showing liver (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 6:1) and lung (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 10:1)-targeting effect. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25).",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

The incubation of mRNA-lipoplexes (made with Lipofectamine 2000 \u00ae ), with different concentrations of fetal bovine serum (FBS), results in a decrease in transfection efficiency (from 92% of transfected cells at 0% FBS to 31% at 10% FBS), with increase in onset time delivery (1.6 h at 0% FBS and 2.9 h at 10% FBS), and a decrease in expression rate. Interestingly, when LNPs are used (made using ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA), the opposite behavior is observed. Regarding these results, an essential parameter to take into consideration for the intracellular fate of the mRNA particles is the protein corona formed after interaction with biological fluids (e.g., FBS) [114,115]. Such protein corona can impact the surface and drastically change mRNA delivery and expression rate.

The influence of the protein corona has been well described for LNPs-mediated liver delivery. Notably, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is well described for the protein corona of LNPs [116]. This interest in ApoE is high, since in addition to LNPs specifically targeting the liver, a lot of LNP formulations exhibit a relatively high amount of liver accumulation in vivo. In the blood circulation and among different functions, ApoE is involved in the transportation of lipids to the liver for recycling. Recently, Sebastiani et al. [117] showed that",

[82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

            "text": "Opsonization remains one of the most commonly discussed biological obstacles known to impact the translation of nanoparticles from animal models to the clinical setting [17]. The dynamic process of binding and exchange of plasma proteins associated with the nanomaterial surface has been demonstrated to play a key role in the clinical translation of materials. It has been shown that some protein modifications produce improved cellular uptake at the tumor site [18], whereas others induce immune responses leading to clearance via the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [15]. Several opsonin components have been identified, including complement proteins [15], apolipoproteins [10], and various metabolites [19], with the adsorption of specific constituents or ratios being responsible for stealth effects (or lack thereof) in PEG-based materials [10]. The combination of nanoparticle-protein [20] and protein-protein [21] interactions leads to a vast array of different protein corona composition. Numerous physicochemical factors have been shown to contribute to the accumulation and subsequent composition of the protein corona including chemical composition [22], size [23], curvature [22], rigidity [24], hydrophobicity [22], presence of protein targeting ligands [25], and surface characteristics [10,11,26]. These factors contribute to the unpredictable outcome of interactions between nanoparticles and physiological phenomena, with enhanced variability also arising due to flow rate encountered in different parts of the animal [27], enzymatic modifications [12], glycosylation state [28], as well as localized plasma protein concentration [27] and content [12] within anatomical regions. While the interaction with blood proteins has been profiled for certain kinds of materials (e.g., gold nanoparticles [29] and liposomes [30]), proteomic fingerprinting has not been done for polymeric nanomedicines (at least under conditions that match those present within the blood stream of an animal). This is due to difficulty in extracting intact complexes and the fragility of the soft corona [14].",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

To find the correlation between structural parameters, medium condition, protein corona, and cellular uptake of PECs, this set of PECs was selected for in vitro tests to simultaneously evaluate effects of D/Ch ratio, thiolation of dextran, Ch Mw, PEC size, and their zeta potential on cellular uptake of the PECs. Furthermore, effects of FBS and pH of the medium on uptake of the PECs were studied. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found out that uptake of the PECs was noticeably enhanced by FBS (p < 0.05). However, it was not significant for the thiolated PEC composed of Ch18 with D/Ch ratio of 0.2 in acidic medium, and Ch-DNA complex in the medium with pH, 7.4. Previous researches indicated that serum proteins influence uptake of nanoparticles by cells as the structurally same nanoparticles can lead to very different biological outcomes in the presence or absence of protein corona 55 . Herein, different parameters have reverse effects on the test results. First, FBS lead to an increase in uptake of the PECs because cell function rises by addition of serum. Second, interaction of nanoparticles with serum proteins leads to an increase in size of the nanoparticles and changes their surface properties such as zeta potential, consequently, it decreases PEC uptake. Third, existence of some proteins in corona such as inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins could enhance the cellular uptake 56,57 .",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "Studies of the protein corona formed on NPs have often utilized normal sera or plasma from mice or humans as sources of macromolecules [70][71][72][73]. Media containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and FBS are examples of sera commonly used in studies of the nanoparticle protein corona [74]. The most common coronal protein from these sources is albumin which comprises ~60% of the blood's protein content [16,75]. Due to its biological prevalence, biocompatibility, and capacity to target tumor receptors, the use of albumin to improve the delivery of cancer drugs or nanomedicines has been extensively explored [76]. However, albumin-based particles can also exhibit low circulation efficiency in vivo due to rapid immune clearance [77,78] and induce severe allergic reactions and other harmful side effects in patients [79], possibly attributed to poor tissue-specific targeting, limiting the approach of using such single components to pre-form a protein corona. \n\nUsing the capacity of NPs to bind or absorb select macromolecules from complex biofluids could result in a protein corona that confers a unique biological identity to the particles. For example, it was demonstrated that phosphocholine-derived liposomes could passively enrich themselves with shed complement C3 that consequently promoted their localization to pneumonic mouse lungs through neutrophil trafficking [80]. NPs can also form distinct biological identities based on their initial exposure to a protein source. When polystyrene NPs were incubated with either human plasma or human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), coronas comprising different concentrations of the same protein, or unique proteins, formed [81]. For instance, kininogen-1 was the 5th most abundant coronal protein in plasma-incubated NPs, while it was the 15th most abundant in CSF-incubated NPs. When analyzing the top 20 most abundant coronal proteins, serum albumin was found only in the plasma-treated NP coronas but not CSF-treated. The resulting coronal fingerprints on NPs may be influenced by variations in the concentration of individual proteins or protein classes found in distinct biological fluids.",

            "text": "In biological fluids, proteins bind to the surface of nanoparticles to form a biological coating around the nanoparticle, known as the protein corona. Over the time, this corona evolves and may modulate nanoparticle-induced processes such as opsonization which have direct consequences on the mode of interaction with cells, the efficacy of cellular NP uptake and thus, the organ targeting, biodistribution, and circulatio time of NP in vertebrates and non-vertebrates [22]. \n\nOur study indicates that the properties of the NP dictate the extent and specificity of protein binding profiles, which are complex, and in line with other studies may well consist of more than hundred different proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Albeit we did not perform a detailed identification of the protein corona composition by comprehensive proteomic methods, previous studies demonstrated that the coronae indeed contain (patho)biologically relevant proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Such proteins are not only involved in essential processes of the blood system and, thus, may act as opsonins or dysopsonins and modulate blood coagulation, but are also implicated in (cytoprotective) signal transduction pathways [22,28,29,46]. Facing the complexity of the plasma corona, one main challenge is clearly to determine to what extent the nanobiological effects observed are mediated directly by the biological activity of corona proteins, and to dissect the involved molecular mechanism. Additionally, the impact of the formation of a corona on transforming the primary properties of the formulated nanomaterials needs to be investigated. Notably, further studies need to consider also the impact of GI fluids or mucus on the biotransformation of ingested nanomaterials. Albeit these investigations will be challenging, the results of such studies are required to complete out understanding of the fate of nanomaterials in physiologically relevant environments. \n\nIn conclusion, based also on our study it is conceivable to speculate that depending on the type of nanomaterials the presence of proteins will have dual effects: For one, proteins may trigger the formation of a biologically active protein corona.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "For instance, smaller NPs adsorb relatively more proteins compared to larger NPs due to having a larger surface area-to-volume ratio in smaller NPs. 227 Additionally, hydrophobic NPs adsorb more than twice the amount of proteins of hydrophilic NPs (12 vs. 26 \u03bcg of proteins per mg of NP, respectively). 228 Other studies showed that hydrophobic NPs have a higher binding affinity for apolipoproteins, while hydrophilic NPs favoured the adsorption of fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. 27,229 esearchers also found that hydroxylation can reduce the adsorption of certain proteins like HSA and IgE, which typically promote immune clearance, while maintaining the adsorption of ApoE, which prolongs circulation in the bloodstream. 230 Charged NPs can cause more protein denaturation than neutral NPs. 231 Studies on polystyrene NPs demonstrated that positively charged NPs have higher binding affinity to proteins with an isoelectric point of less than 5.5 (e.g., albumin), while negatively charged NPs prefer proteins with higher values (e.g., IgG). 232 Another study on various organic and inorganic NPs has demonstrated that their exposure to human serum albumin results in diverse corona formation and composition. These differences manifest in the hydrodynamic size of the NPs. 119 Porous particles decreased the amount of adsorbed proteins due to the size-exclusion effect. 227 In turn, coating NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), zwitterionic compounds or polysaccharides can also minimise protein adsorption. 233,234 owever, when targeting ligands are attached to the NP surface, serum proteins interfere with their binding to target cells. Conjugating targeting ligands to an equilibrated corona is an alternative to overcome the issue and enhance their binding. 235 n the other hand, the biomolecular corona can impact the NMs' physico-chemical properties and highly influence their circulation time, as well as their deposition in tissue.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "Instead of viewing protein corona formation as exclusively detrimental to successful NP distribution, growing evidence indicates the potential for controlled attraction of distinct proteins to aid accumulation in the targeted tissue, a concept termed endogenous targeting. [70]Indeed, this approach has been successfully applied in the case of Onpattro, the first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP for treating hereditary disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.The liver affinity of Onpattro has been strongly linked to its ApoE-rich protein corona, particularly through the interaction with hepatocytes via ApoE-binding receptors like low-density lipoprotein receptors. [71]Very recently this hallmark has been updated, as ApoE-containing high density lipoprotein enriched in NP-corona complexes was shown to be a better predictor of in vivo liver efficacy compared to sole ApoE.

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

            "text": "Furthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

While there is an urgent need to understand the influence of this protein corona on nanocarriers' interactions with cells the strong impact of the protein source on corona formation and the consequence for interaction with different cell types are factors that are regularly neglected, but should be taken into account for a meaningful analysis. In this study, the importance of the choice of protein source used for in vitro protein corona analysis is concisely investigated. Major and decisive differences in cellular uptake of a polystyrene nanoparticle incubated in fetal bovine serum, human serum, human citrate and heparin plasma are reported. Furthermore, the protein compositions are determined for coronas formed in the respective incubation media. A strong influence of heparin, which is used as an anticoagulant for plasma generation, on cell interaction is demonstrated. While heparin enhances the uptake into macrophages, it prevents internalization into HeLa cells. Taken together we can give the recommendation that human plasma anticoagulated with citrate seems to give the most relevant results for in vitro studies of nanoparticle uptake.",

            "text": "The size of aggregates may be dependent on the concentration and they tend to be slightly larger in culture media than in PBS. Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

            "text": "LNPs possess high free energy due to their small size and large surface area, which promotes their interactions with biological macromolecules in biological fluids. Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

            "text": "Further, they correlated the relative teemingness of known proteins in the PC with the positive or negative impact of NPs on cellular uptake in cancer and stem cells to discriminate the key corona component. Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

The adsorbed molecular composition represents a challenge for feasible medical applications of NPs, as it impacts on the biodistribution of nanotherapeutics and modulates their efficacy [9]. \n\nIntravenously administered NPs undergo the action of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) that recognizes foreign material after being marked by the adsorption of specific serum proteins in a process called opsonization. If opsonins (blood proteins, such as immunoglobulins (Ig) and complement factors) are present in the corona, they promote the cellular uptake of NPs through the opsonin-cognate receptors expressed on the phagocyte surface [10,11]. In addition, the protein corona could conceal specific ligands in the NP surface, influencing the targeting capability. Studies have found that this ability can be lost or retained in the presence of plasma proteins [12,13].",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

When an inorganic or organic material comes in contact with biological fluids, such as blood, rapid interactions occur instantly and lead to protein adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles. Therefore, the interaction of nanoparticles with proteins is highly dependent on the surface characteristics and particle size of the nanoparticles. 43,44 6][47] These types of interactions may cause undesirable toxic effects or facilitate the delivery of nanoparticles to organs, because plasma proteins play a critical role in the disposition, transportation, and deposition of both endogenous and exogenous molecules by noncovalent interaction. 48 In particular, nanoparticleprotein corona implicates cellular interaction in terms of toxicity, uptake, and immune response. For example, it was reported that albumin-adsorbed single-walled carbon nanotubes contributed to the induction of anti-inflammatory Notes: Serum protein adsorbed on (or bound to) the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) may facilitate immune recognition (uptake and elimination by immune cells) or cellular uptake. Protein conformational changes as a consequence of nanoparticle-protein interaction could cause undesirable toxicological effects or decrease biological activity. Uptake amount, uptake mechanism, and target-organ distribution of nanoparticles can also be influenced by nanoparticle-protein corona. \n\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164].

            "text": "In summary, this study revealed a previously unknown effect of intracellular exchange of protein corona components on CMA activation as a result of proteostasis disruption. The enhanced CMA activity arising from shedding of blood proteins intracellularly was further identified by determining the cellular metabolism at both cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 6). In brief, as nanoparticles migrated from the bloodstream into cells, the nanoparticles would disassociate part of their acquired blood proteins, which were replaced by cellular proteins due to their higher affinity for the nanoparticles' surface. This intracellular transformation of the protein corona further modulated nanoparticle-induced biological processes, including proteostasis and metabolic stress responses, especially glycolysis and lipid metabolism. This alteration of cell metabolism was caused by the interplay of coronal proteins with other molecules in the cellular environments. PKM2, a key molecule for cellular metabolism, was incorporated into the nanoparticles corona and subsequently dominated their biological identity. \n\nFor NMs used as nanomedicines or nanocarriers, a better understanding of the \"biological identity\" of their intracellular protein corona is crucial to ensure their biological benefits while minimizing their potential hazards. Biologically, proteostasis is central to cell function, and its disruption, as revealed by the current study, entails profound implications for mediating human disorders ranging from cancers to aging. Furthermore, the protein corona-induced CMA can influence cellular clearance of nanoparticles and alter cellular metabolism, which may impact the efficiency and bioavailability of nanoscale delivery systems. CMA could be a useful target for directing and manipulating the cellular and subcellular fate of nanoparticles. Such understanding of the intracellular protein corona, together with our existing knowledge of the physical and biochemical transformations of NMs in tissues and organs (11,57,58), highlights the complexity of the nano-bio interface and provides a crucial new molecular insight for guiding the safe design of future nanomedicines.",

            "text": "Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73). Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would influence the biological identity of NPs [28]. The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29]. Understanding NPs-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30]. The physiological environment to which NPs are first exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with NPs to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing inflammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31]. \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer NPs and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms.

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

            "text": "The biological interactions between nanoparticles and circulatory proteins lead to the formation of \"protein corona\" [ 153 ]. This effect influences the nanoparticles uptake (via selective receptor-mediated targeting), lysosomal/endosome escape, transcytosis across the BBB/penetration across the BBTB, intracellular trafficking, and exocytosis from BCECs etc. Certain studies reported that targeted synthetic nanoparticles, although they enter the tumor cells, however, they lose brain tumor targeting specificity due to alterations in their protein structure, orientation, and/or functions. The binding of nanoparticles to opsonin, such as immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, complement components (C3/C4), etc., showed rapid clearance from RES and subsequently triggered immune responses. For instance, folic-acid receptor-targeted liposomes lose their specificity by macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in non-target tissue due to enhanced endogenous IgM corona on the surface of the liposomes [ 154 ]. Similarly, Xiao et al. in their findings, reported that transferrin-targeted nanoparticles reduced their ability to target transferrin receptors in vitro studies. Furthermore, they decided to investigate the impact of this protein corona against brain drug delivery. They found that the composition of protein corona was significantly altered after BBB transcytosis (that recapitulated the in vivo brain targeting) in theirBTB model. This in vitro and in vivo discrepancy in targeting specificity was probably due to the absorption of another protein like apolipoproteins (e.g., apolipoprotein A-I) on the surface of the transferrin-targeted nanoparticles, improving their permeability across the BBB. Collectively, these findings suggested the potential of protein corona in improving the targeting across the BBB and guiding the in vivo fate of the nanoparticle [ 155 ]. More interestingly, chimeric protein modification adopted by biomimetic/bioinspired drug delivery systems was reported to decrease the influence of biomolecular corona due to their surface occupancy.",

            "text": "For many years, the main adopted strategies aimed to reduce protein adsorption to prevent immunological recognition and preserve ligand exposure. For instance, hydrophilic polymers are often grafted onto the surface of NPs in order to reduce interactions with plasma components. Currently, the most used polymer is Polyethylene glycol (PEG) due to its near-neutral and hydrophilic properties [14,15]. However, this functionalization does not completely suppress protein binding [16,17]. Actually, some results indicate that the PEG \"stealth\" effect could be due to the creation of a specific protein corona. Sch\u00f6ttler and colleagues studied human plasma protein adsorption onto PEG and poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)-modified polystyrene NPs. The presence of polymer chains on the NP surface did not prevent protein adsorption, but changed the corona's composition, recruiting specific apolipoproteins. Among them, ApoJ (also called Clusterin) plays a predominant role as a dysopsonin, namely, it reduces non-specific cellular uptake in murine macrophages [5]. Although other unknown molecules contribute to this phenomenon, Clusterin has been shown to also prevent the internalization of non-PEGylated NPs, including silver and silica NPs [18]. Therefore, immune cell escape does not seem to be a feature of the polymer shell per se, but it does require specific protein binding. \n\nMany studies have demonstrated that pre-formed protein coronas of other dysopsonins can control NP-cell interactions. One of them is albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood, that has been used to develop a protective coating that avoids plasma protein adsorption and prolongs the NP circulation time. It is worth mentioning that albumin is and has been frequently identified in the protein corona of several types of NPs, modulating their tissue localization and cell targeting. Several studies on albumin-coated NPs made of different bulk materials can be found in the literature.",

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Dendrimers have delivered RNA to the central nervous system 168 , acted as intramuscular vaccines against the Ebola and H1N1 viruses 169 , and deli vered siRNA to hepatic endothelial cells 170 . Dendrimer structure has also been modified to protect nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation 171 and to enhance endosomal escape 172 .\n\nActive versus passive tissue targeting Passive tissue targeting. As outlined in the section 'Lipids and lipid-based nanoparticles' , research has demonstrated that LNPs originally developed for liver siRNA or mRNA delivery can be redirected to other organs without the need for antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers or other active targeting ligands that bind specific receptors on the surface of target cells 173 . For the purposes of this Review, we define such retargeting, probably driven by interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins in endogenous trafficking pathways, as a process termed 'passive targeting' or 'endogenous targeting' (Fig. 4a). As a sphere becomes smaller, its surface area to volume ratio increases; as a result, nanoparticles have large surface areas 174 and when a nanoparticle comes into contact with a biological milieu, many biomolecules can coat its surface 175 . By covering the nanoparticle surface, these coronas (proteins that bind to the nanoparticle surface) change the chemical and biological molecules at the surface of the nanoparticle, thereby altering how the nanoparticle interacts with immune cells 176 and on-target tissues 177 . In one clinical example 178 , apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption was required for ionizable, but not cationic, lipids to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes 179 . Researchers have found LNPs that can be trafficked via an albumin-dependent mechanism 180 as well as LNPs with variable dependence on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and caveolin-1 receptors 136,181 . In addition to the effect that the protein corona can have on LNP tropism, LNP size can also contribute to passive tissue targeting.\n\nIn one example,",

            "text": "NPs can enter the human body through multiple pathways and be distributed to different organs through circulating blood. In blood, NPs progressively and selectively adsorb proteins and form protein coronas that reduce their surface free energy. According to binding strength and relative position, a protein corona can be divided into a hard part and a soft part. The hard corona binds to the surface of the NP tightly, where it forms a near-monolayer. The soft corona is formed over top of the hard corona, and the interactions between the soft corona and NPs are weak (Monopoli et al., 2012). The protein corona on NPs can be analyzed by atomic force microscope images, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and mass spectrometry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Ge et al., 2011). \n\nThe formation of protein corona can result in undesired cellular uptake, nanoparticle aggregation, or immune responses (Karmali and Simberg, 2011). However, it can also alleviate cytotoxicity. For example, in THP-1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the adsorption of bovine fibrinogen, bovine serum albumin (BSA), transferrin, or gamma globulin formed compact layers on NPs' surface, which effectively shield cells from the exposure of NPs' surfaces and alleviate the cytotoxicity induced by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Ge et al., 2011). In another study, serum protein adsorption significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of graphene oxide (GO) in A549 cells (Hu et al., 2011). In addition, protein binding can drastically alter the physicochemical properties of NPs and affect their behavior in vivo (Albanese et al., 2012). \n\nIn this section, we summarize recently published literatures related to the regulation of protein binding by NPs' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and combinatorial surface modifications (Table 1), which are generally considered as important factors that characterize NPs' surface coating.",

            "text": "These layers may remodel over time as continuous adsorption, exchange, and rearrangement of corona composition. Albumin was a major component of both hard and soft coronas, although myriad other immunoglobulin, complement, and other unidentified proteins were involved in a dynamic remodeling process over 30 min. The overall goal of such efforts is to elucidate specific surface features of nanoparticles that might promote selective accumulation of desirable corona components during in vivo circulation. However, given the likely variability of serum protein, lipid, and immunoglobulin composition from patient to patient, selective post hoc tailoring of the corona presents challenges to achieving specificity for molecular targeting. \n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-coat nanoparticles with various components that can be specified in advance in an effort to improve selective compartmental trafficking [118,[121][122][123]. Dysopsonins such as albumin or various apolipoproteins can be preloaded onto nanoparticle surfaces prior to injection to establish a hard corona that enhances circulation times, reduces toxicity, and avoids RES clearance [124][125][126][127][128]. Hou et al., reported that PBN formed from p5RHH peptides and siRNA that were pretreated with albumin to form a hard corona enhanced transfection in vitro, while stabilizing PBN size and reducing charge to mildly negative (-5 to -7 mv) as suggested earlier by Xiao et al. [106] for enhanced extrahepatic delivery [51,52]. Subsequent studies in vivo with systemically administered p5RHH-RNA PBN confirmed avoidance of liver uptake and a shift to kidney clearance for the p5RHH system [66,114,129,130].",

The corona paradigm has been established since 2007 (2,3), underscoring the acquired biological identity of engineered NMs and impacting the therapeutic efficacy (4) and safety of NMs as well as their biological behaviors, including cell recognition (5-7), ligand targeting efficacy (8,9), biodistribution (10,11), immune modulation (12)(13)(14)(15), and toxicity (16)(17)(18)(19). \n\nMost of the current biomolecular corona studies have focused on the blood plasma/ serum, where immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, complements, and coagulation cascade biomolecules are enriched on the nanoparticle surface and critically affect the nanoparticle-entailed pathophysiology and toxicity downstream (5)(6)(7)20). However, most targets of NMs for biomedical applications are at the subcellular level (21)(22)(23)(24)(25), and thus, understanding NMs involvement in intracellular events is important to ensure their therapeutic efficacy (4). To date, limited efforts have been devoted to delineating the uptake routes, and very few studies have focused on the molecular cell biology once the corona-coated NMs become resident in cells and/or tissues. It is already known that the corona on polymer-coated NMs can exchange with other biomolecules that are both internal and external to the cell (26). The nanoparticle-intracellular protein entities can regulate the macrophage phenotype and induce a stress response of the endothelium (27).",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Since COVID-19 infection is associated with aberrant coagulation cascade, resulting in serious alteration of coagulating factors and other mediators, timely detection of rising levels of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and clotting factors in blood plasma could provide the information necessary for clinicians to choose the right strategy (e.g., appropriate dosing of blood-thinning medications) and aggressiveness of treatment to prevent the lethal consequences of massive blood clotting such as heart and/or brain strokes. \n\nAnalysis of the biomolecular/protein corona profiles of many nanoparticles (e.g., silica, 107 polystyrene, 107 and gold 58 ) has revealed the capacity of the corona in absorption of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and/or coagulants, which can be extremely helpful for detection of sudden increases in the abundance of these proteins in blood plasma. We have shown that precoating of nanoparticles with specific proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins) can significantly improve the recruitment of similar proteins from blood plasma. 108 Therefore, precoating nanoparticles with clot-related proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrin, factor VIII, factor XIII, tissue plasminogen activator, or protein Z could significantly intensify the recruitment of similar proteins into the corona, creating a unique opportunity for the development of a sensitive and robust approach for rapid identification of even subtle signs of clotting in plasma. These protein-enriched coronas can be detected through welldeveloped colorimetric sensing platforms, including smartphone-readable systems for detection and discrimination of multiple proteins. 109 In addition, well-designed (opto)plasmonic nanoparticles 110 /nanosensors 111 (e.g., gold 110,112 ) may identify changes in the secretion of blood-clotting proteins by generating colored solutions amenable to detection with the naked eye or point-of-care devices.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

            "text": "This study addresses several parameters which are often neglected when analyzing interactions of nanocarriers, proteins and cells, such as protein concentration, protein source, different anticoagulants and cell type. Our results reveal important differences for the protein corona formation and NP uptake dependent on the protein source, emphasizing that the formation of different bionanostructures exerts different biological effects. \n\nThe results presented indicate that, in general, proteins attenuate the uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles into cells. Related results have been reported by Lesniak et al., showing a reduced uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles when proteins are present in the cell culture medium. 17 Furthermore, we show that the concentration of the protein source has deep implications on particle uptake. Serum and plasma concentrations as low as 0.5% already have a major impact by strongly reducing the internalization of an amino-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticle into HeLa cells. This should be taken into  account in all experiments investigating cellular uptake of nanocarriers. In order to adjust in vitro experiments to be as close as possible to in vivo conditions, it should be considered to use 100% of the respective protein source as this is the natural concentration in vivo. However, no large discrepancies between 10%, the concentration most commonly used for cell culture experiments, and 100% were observed for particle cell interactions. \n\nMost importantly, it was demonstrated that the choice of the protein source is crucial for nanoparticle uptake analysis. Many recent studies of great importance investigating the different aspects of the protein corona of nanocarriers employed different protein sources as FBS, 17,18 human serum, 19,20 human citrate 3,21 or EDTA plasma 2,22 without further stating reasons for their choice. The results shown here emphasize the necessity of a careful decision concerning the protein source as the outcome of experiments is strongly dependent on it. \n\nHard corona protein profiles varied significantly between the investigated protein sources: FBS, human serum, human heparin and citrate plasma. A strong difference in corona composition was especially prominent between the human and bovine media. As FBS is the most frequently used supplement for many cells cultured in vitro, it is also often employed in protein corona studies.",

            "text": "A recent study has shown that incorporating cationic lipids as helper lipids in LNPs enhances their targeting specificity towards pulmonary endothelial cells [142]. Once endothelial cells are saturated, the LNPs target other cell types such as pulmonary immune and lung epithelial cells. Additionally, this study proposes an interesting hypothesis that the pre-treatment of cells may affect the in vivo distribution of mRNA-LNPs. Researchers have discovered that cells can alter their response to mRNA-LNPs by altering the processing of mRNA and subsequent protein production, such as translation initiation, complex formation, ribosome scanning, and initiation codon recognition. However, this hypothesis requires further in vivo experimentation for validation. \n\nSimilarly, Qiu et al. [143] found that through the modification of the ionizable cationic lipid tail structure, specifically by introducing an amide bond (N-series LNPs), the delivery specificity of mRNA-LNPs can be accurately tuned to target the lungs with a high degree of precision. Among them, 306N16B LNPs exhibited the highest targeting ability. Their protein coronas mainly consisted of serum albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2 chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3 chain. Based on these findings, fibrinogen was speculated to play an important role in directing pulmonary endothelial cell targeting, Previous studies have shown that fibrinogen coating can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelialization [157], which is consistent with the findings of Qiu's study. However, besides fibrinogen, the potential involvement of other proteins remained unclear, and further investigation is required to determine whether a single protein or multiple proteins act in concert. Additionally, modifying the head structure of N-series LNPs allows for selective targeting of various types of lung cells including pulmonary endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells (Fig. 9A) [143]. \n\nOverall, in the absence of active ligands, the addition of cationic lipids and structural variations in cationic lipids can both impact protein coronas adsorbed onto the LNP   surface, thus affecting their organ-level and cellular-level targeting.",

Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

The development of a protein corona affects the chemical and physical characteristics of LNPs, increasing the hydrodynamic diameter and modifying the charge on the surface. Nevertheless, all protein coronas contained different patterns of proteins related with the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and the transport capacity, to modulate, in diverse ways, LNP-cell interactions [116]. The initial physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface properties, composition, and structure, predominantly determine the biological fate of LNPs within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine. Notably, LNPs can be categorized as either digestible or indigestible based on their composition, resulting in two distinct biological paths for LNPs. Digestible LNPs undergo digestion initiated by lipases and subsequent hydrolysis across the GI tract upon ingestion. This process leads to the breakdown of lipids, resulting in lipid digestion products rich in fatty acids and monoglycerides. These products, along with encapsulated drugs, bile salts, and phospholipids, form mixed micelles. After absorption by enterocytes, these lipid digestion products and encapsulated drugs enter the systemic circulation through either the portal vein or the lymphatic system. The specific route taken depends on the lipid structure within the LNP formulation and the hydrophobic nature of the encapsulated drugs. Alternatively, indigestible LNPs can remain intact and potentially penetrate the mucus layer to reach epithelial surfaces. After penetration, these LNPs can be transported through the tight junction, or absorbed up by enterocytes or transported by M cells, to enter the circulation [117].",

            "text": "A commonly investigated nanoparticle application is the development of target-specific drug carriers. Here, the corona may have an important role as plasma proteins have been shown to block ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface or compete with the interaction between ligands and cell receptors [20][21][22]. Dell'Orco et al. have previously modelled targeted delivery in the presence of an exchanging corona, to identify factors that are important for successful targeting [20,21,23]. The size of the bound proteins and their binding affinity for the particle surface were identified as very important. However, the particle size was found to be even more crutial. In the current work, this feature is addressed in experiments and confirmed to be important. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all studies characterizing the protein corona are performed in serum or plasma stabilized with different agents. In this work we investigate the corona composition as a function of the source of the plasma proteins, i.e. dependent on the treatment of blood after withdrawal. Blood can, after withdrawal, be treated in different ways to generate different liquids, conventionally named as: whole blood, whole blood with EDTA or Citrate, blood plasma or blood serum. We find that the protein corona composition differ between these four different biological fluids. As the protein corona is important for target delivery, this will have implications for the in vitro evaluation of a target-specific nanoparticle system. \n\nWe also show that the ratio between particle surface area and biological macromolecules in a sample affect the composition of the corona. \n\nKnowledge about composition and dynamics of protein coronas is vital for the development of successful future nanoparticle-based medical applications. However, our current methods to analyze the corona may not be the optimal ones. In this paper, the limitations of the current methods are highlighted and the research fields is encouraged to find new suitable methods.",

The protein corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' blood circulation, clearance, biodistribution, biodegradation, and delivery efficiency. For instance, opsonin's enhances the phagocytosis and removal of nanoparticles from circulation, whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins can extend their circulation time. However, the protein corona can mask nanoparticle targeting groups, such as transferrin, reducing their delivery efficiency to tumours. Nanoparticles need to be small enough, typically less than 4 \u00b5m, for effective cellular uptake, with those under 100 nm being absorbed more efficiently through endocytosis. Drug carriers between 100-1000 nm have higher bioavailability once endocytosed, with nanoparticles around 50 nm showing the highest cellular uptake. 51 The surface charge of nanoparticles also plays a crucial role, as cationic and neutral particles exhibit higher transport efficiency due to electrostatic attraction than negatively charged particles. Uptake mechanisms include clathrinmediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and physical adhesion followed by penetration, while larger particles involve energy-dependent endocytosis. Additionally, physicochemical surface coatings, such as chitosan, can optimize paracellular transport for drug delivery.",

Interactions with these immune cells are facilitated by the acquisition of a protein corona composed of plasma proteins adsorbed to the NP surface (Bashiri et al., 2023;Kopac, 2021;Meng et al., 2022;Rampado et al., 2020). An inner 'hard' corona is bound directly to the NP surface whereas the outer 'soft' corona associates with the 'hard' corona through weak protein-protein interactions' (Bashiri et al., 2023, Kopac, 2021, Meng et al., 2022;Rampado et al., 2020). NP size, shape, and molecular composition affect protein corona makeup as does the solution temperature, pH, plasma protein size, and protein concentration. The major components of the synthetic nanoparticle protein corona are comprised of anti-thrombin III, complement C3, complement factor H, factor V, fibronectin, and immunoglobulin G (Zhang et al., 2020). Intriguingly, variations in the composition of the NP protein corona can serve as diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers (Kamaly et al., 2022;Meng et al., 2022). \n\nIV administration of NPs loaded with antitumor drugs and biological agents disperses them throughout the entire body. Unlike normal tissues, the vasculature in a solid tumour is irregular and heterogeneous, with leaky vessels and poor lymphatic drainage (Konerding et al., 1999;Warren et al., 1978).",

            "text": "Upon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

            "text": "Moreover, bio-coronas can enhance the effectiveness of NPs used as drug delivery vehicles by increasing their payload capacity (Hamad-Schifferli 2015). Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "The constituents of the protein corona, shown in Figure 16 and Table 1, display an abundance of transport proteins, including several albumin proteins, but a lack of immunoglobulins. Some coagulation factors and acute phase reactants are present, which may contribute to opsonisation. \n\nOpsonisation is the process of 'tagging' foreign bodies with opsonins to facilitate clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. Opsonins are mostly immunoglobulins, complement proteins and fibrinogen. On the other hand, there are molecules in the plasma which protect foreign molecules from clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. These include albumins and apolipoproteins, both of which were observed in our nanoparticle protein corona. \n\nIn conclusion, the nanoparticles we fabricated in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM formed a unique protein corona consisting mainly of transport proteins with lack of presence of common opsonins. This suggests that these nanoparticles will be less likely to be cleared out by the reticuloendothelial system and thus would have an increased half-life in plasma. Limitations concerning protein corona would relate to its effect on increasing the particle size, which would undermine the EPR effect crucial for accumulation of the particles in target tissues [11,26]. \n\nIn summary, the benchwork and in vitro experiments displayed a potential for MgF 2 particles to be used as a drug delivery system. Modifications to the nanocrystals will be needed to improve drug binding affinity and cellular uptake. The efficacy of the particles in vivo is yet to be assessed, as is the capability of surface modification with ligands to improve specific targeting and avoid sequestration in the liver and reticuloendothelial systems.",

            "text": "Moreover, bio-coronas can enhance the effectiveness of NPs used as drug delivery vehicles by increasing their payload capacity (Hamad-Schifferli 2015). Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "Another critical effect affecting biodistribution is protein corona, which coats particles with serum proteins [55]. Because of the nanoparticle coating, slight alterations in surface charges are expected, leading to further interactions between serum proteins in a cascade fashion and thus preventing the interaction between nanomedicines and their tumor targets [56]. However, it is essential to emphasize that the protein corona effect involves two classes of components affecting nanomedicines' biodistribution: opsonins and dysopsonins [57]. Opsonins, such as proteins of the complement system (C3b and C1q) and immunoglobulins, are the most common, and their adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles is responsible for their engulfment and clearance by the RES-associated phagocytic cells, more specifically in the liver and spleen [58][59][60][61][62][63]. Engrafting hydrophilic or amphiphilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), on the surface of the particles, is one strategy for reducing RES recognition [60,64,65]. Despite the popularity of this technique, issues related to PEG molecules' stability and immunogenicity have emerged in the last few years [66,67]. Recently, zwitterionic materials, such as sulfobetaine, have been used to confer stealth properties. Their mixed charges and electrostatic repulsion account for dense packing, thus impairing protein corona formation [68][69][70][71]. In contrast, dysopsonins, such as clusterin (apolipoprotein J) and albumin, have the opposite effect, prolonging nanomedicine's half-life in circulation [64,72]. For example, the glycoprotein CD47, which is expressed in all cellular membranes of humans, mice, and other mammals [73], interacts with CD172a on phagocytes [74] and inhibits macrophage uptake of antibody-coated mouse red blood cells (RBCs) [75].",

            "text": "CD36 is a kind of integral proteins expressed on the membrane of macrophages, endothelial and microglial cells. It has been reported that CD36 is associated with the recruitment of caveolin and subsequently play the role of phagocytosis 60 . Therefore, the enhancement of nanoparticles uptake in the presence of CD36 may be related to caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Further studies are required to characterize the details of the mechanisms involved in these potential proteins. \n\nIt is commonly believed that drug loading hardly influences the biological processing of nanoparticles. However, we found that the brain distribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles increased significantly after aM loading. Previous studies found that, with the increase of nanoparticles hydrophobicity, more proteins could be adsorbed on the surface 61,62 . Therefore, the increased hydrophobic functional group CH 3 O on the surface of NP-aM is very likely contribute to the larger number of protein absorption, in which the enrichment of RAB5A and CD36 might play an important role in enhancing the delivery of NP-aM to the brain and microglia. \n\nRepeated administration also caused the change of protein corona composition. Proteomic analysis showed that although the total number of proteins absorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles hardly changed between the 7d-NP-aM-corona and 0d-NP-aM-corona (and 7d-NP-corona and 0d-NP-corona), the specific protein composition altered. This could be due to the significant differences in plasma protein composition after repeated nanoparticle administration, in which immunoglobulin and complement proteins were found enriched in the 7d-plasma. \n\nBeside dosing frequency and loading condition, other factors likely to influence corona composition should also be taken into consideration, such as PEG density, different routes of administration and disease condition. Moreover, the determination of protein corona formed in vivo would better reflect the protein corona on the biological behavior of the nanoparticles. However, the separation of protein corona formed in vivo is rather complex, usually need several steps such as centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography separation and ultrafiltration 50,63 . These processes may largely remove the soft corona on the surface of nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

The blood half-life of the DOPE-C8-LNPs was clearly less than 10 min (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, the biodistribution of the LNPs 1 h after intravenous injection was examined using IVIS (Figure 2D). The DOPE-Cx showed a significantly higher level of accumulation in the kidney compared with that when using DSPC, albeit at lower values. No differences between LNPs were observed for other organs. The highest accumulation was in the liver, which was followed by slight accumulations in the spleen and lungs. Intrahepatic distribution of the LNPs revealed that consistent levels of all LNPs accumulate mainly in hepatocytes, which are located in an area enclosed by blood vessels (Figure 2E). These results suggest that DOPE-C8 has a limited effect on the biodistribution of LNPs and that the improved mRNA expression level derives from intracellular processes such as endosomal escape. \n\nWhen nanoparticles such as LNPs are exposed to proteins such as blood, they form a protein-based layer on their surface, which is referred to as the biomolecular corona. [11] The physicochemical properties of LNPs affect their interactions with proteins and alter the biomolecular corona. The properties of the biomolecular corona are known to alter both the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of LNPs. [12] Reports also show that phospholipids such as DSPC are preferentially located in the outer layer of LNPs due to their bulky hydrophilic moiety compared with that of other lipidic components such as ionizable lipids and cholesterol. [13] egatively charged phospholipids are known to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs. [14] e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance.

            "text": "This implied that many proteins on the surface of nanoparticles were unfolded. In the literature, unfolded proteins in the corona have been shown as causative to the aggregation of nanoparticles (36). \n\nThe top 50 most abundant coronal proteins were arranged in the heat map and classified into three clusters (Fig. 1D). For cluster I, the protein content showed a decreasing trend passing from the GNP B to the GNP BLC . Specifically, fibrinogens (FIBB, FIBG, and FIBA) displayed the most obvious downward trends (Fig. 1E). Signaling pathway analysis revealed that most proteins in the corona were related to the formation of fibrin clot (Fig. 1H). The protein concentrations in cluster II gradually increased as the particles transited from lysosomal to cytosolic solutions. These were mainly cellular component proteins, and the changes mainly occurred during the passage of GNPs from lysosomal to cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1F). Most of the acquired proteins were involved in glycolysis and glucose metabolism (Fig. 1I), which are essential processes to provide energy for cellular growth. This suggests that GNP B phagocytosis might affect the glycolysis process of cells. The concentrations of the proteins in cluster III first increased in lysosomal solutions and then decreased upon the subsequent entry of the nanoparticles to the cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1G). Innate immune system and complement pathway proteins were revealed as the major signaling pathways in which the proteins in cluster III were involved (Fig. 1J). These results suggested that the intracellular microenvironments interfered with the initial protein corona on the GNPs acquired from blood and that the release of blood proteins from the particle surface inside the cell (following their displacement by cellular components) might modulate cellular signaling and disturb subsequent physiological cellular processes. Deficiencies in proteostasis have been shown to facilitate the progression of numerous diseases, such as lysosomal storage disease, cystic fibrosis, amyloidogenesis, as well as cancer (37)(38)(39). Consequences of blood proteins being released from the GNP corona intracellularly are explored next.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, the surface chemistry was observed to outweigh the impact of size on the observed PSNP cellular associations with the sulfone functionalized PNPSs being higher associated to the cells than the carbonyl functionalized nanoparticles. Reported differences in NP uptake thus not always reflect differences in biological processes, but merely the physiochemical interaction of NPs with the exposure media. The type of surface functionalization on NPs was found earlier to be one of the major factors determining adhesions, uptake, transport, and distribution of NPs, which appears to be mainly driven by the size of the protein corona [9,46]. Here, we extended our previous semi-quantitative protein corona analysis using SDS-PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S1) with a quantitative proteomic analysis using label-free LC-MS/MS, as described by [14]. As previously, and commonly, done, the present study was performed in the presence of fetal  [45]. The proteomic analysis showed that the protein corona isolated from the PSNPs was composed of 172 different proteins. We observed an enrichment of proteins involved in binding, apolipoproteins, and acute phase proteins' groups and a less pronounced enrichment of complement factors proteins group. Among these proteins, the alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) protein was most abundantly present on all types of NPs, but the function of this protein is currently unknown. In other studies apolipoproteins have been identified as a dominant protein group in NP protein coronas [47][48][49]. Comparing the protein corona composition among the PSNPs studied here, it was found that A2M, AFP, APOA2, APOH and HBB proteins were significantly less absorbed on the (-SM) functionalized PSNPs Strikingly, the cellular association and transport across a monolayer of Caco-2 cells of these (-SM) functionalized PSNPs was also significantly different compared to the carboxylated PSNPs. Two studies have successfully attempted to correlate the composition of the protein composition of the nanoparticle corona with cellular interaction [50,51].",

            "text": "It has been well known that the biomolecular corona formed on particles upon contact with cell culture medium in vitro or human plasma in vivo plays a critical role in the efficacy of nanomedicines [1,2]. The formation of protein corona can impact the biological processes of NMs, such as long circulation time, biodistribution, immune cell activation, cytotoxicity, specific cellular uptake, targeting efficiency, and more [3]. For instance, the opsonin proteins in the biomolecular corona, including immunoglobulins and complement proteins, facilitate phagocytic recognition, leading to sequestration and reduced bioavailability of the NMs [4]. To ensure the efficacy and safety of nanomedicine, various strategies have been developed [5,6] to limit the non-specific protein adsorption on NMs, such as stealth surface modification on NMs with hydrophilic or zwitterionic polymers such as antifouling polyethylene glycol, poly(phosphoester) (PPE), zwitterionic poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PEEP), poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), etc. [5][6][7][8]. However, it has been demonstrated that even with antifouling polymer coatings, the non-specific protein adsorption on the surface of NMs is inevitable [9]. Recent studies have shown that precoating using endogenous biomolecules, such as albumin, clusterin, and fibrinogen, has emerged as a promising strategy [10,11]. Preformed albumin-Au nanorod complexes have been demonstrated to reduce cytotoxicity and macrophage uptake, promote biostability and long circulation time, and enhance tumor targeting and penetration [12]. The specific protein coating on the surface of NMs will influence their cellular uptake and modify the interaction among NMs themselves, which ultimately affects their intracellular fate and in vivo biodistribution.",

            "text": "In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6). \n\nApart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3-induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1). Multi-angle dynamic light scattering revealed a larger size of pristine nanocarriers compared to the PEGylated formulations in protein-free media, and a smaller particle size under protein corona conditions. This might be due to changes in the light scattering properties and/or a reduction in aggregation after PEGylation. Regarding the surface charge of the nanocarriers, all samples presented a rather neutral zeta potential, which consistently appeared slightly negative for all mouse plasma pre-incubated nanocarrier formulations.",

            "text": "Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.",

Thus, future activated macrophage cells or more macrophage-like cells studies could provide additional valuable information. The results also highlight the importance of choosing appropriate in vitro cell system to address the desired endpoint. \n\nWhen nanoparticles are introduced into the in vitro biological system, they can rapidly interact with the serum proteins, generating a dynamic protein corona layer. The protein corona alters nanoparticle physiochemical properties, affects its interaction with cells, and defines the biological properties of nanoparticles [44,45]. It is the nanoparticle-protein corona that affects cellular uptake and nanoparticle internalization in living cell systems. On the other hand, the nature of the nanoparticles also determines the composition of proteins in the corona. Even for a specific nanoparticle material type, the size of the nanoparticle and its surface modifications are able to considerably change the nature of the biologically active proteins in the corona and thereby change the cellular uptake [46]. Different from THP-1 and U937 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), HL-60 cells were incubated in IMDM with 20% FBS. Although albumin is the most abundant protein in the FBS and is also the main corona component after incubation in cell culture media, the stability of the protein corona requires the presence of other adsorbed proteins on the particle's surface [47]. Cheng et al. presented different Au nanoparticle uptake profiles in RAW264.7 cells in the absence and presence of serum [48]. More FBS content, different cell culture medium components, and distinct cell membrane properties account for different formations of the protein corona, thus causing distinct cellular iron uptake profile in HL-60 cells.",

            "text": "Naked nanoparticles possess a high affinity for biomolecules, as they can easily bind to the nanoparticle surface through various bonding methods. However, pre-coating nanoparticles with biomolecules and proteins reduces the rate of interaction between the nanoparticles and proteins, as compared to bare nanoparticles. When nanoparticles are presuspended with specific proteins, a distinct protein corona is formed in vivo, rich in those particular proteins, which subsequently influences processes such as cellular absorption by specific cells. For instance, pretreated tiny PS particles modified with dysopsonins Apo A-IV and Apo C-III exhibit reduced cellular uptake, whereas coating the same particles with 2-glycoprotein 1 yields the opposite outcome. These findings suggest that Apo A-IV and Apo C-III may be beneficial for enhancing specific uptake, while clusterin coating effectively prevents nanoparticles from adhering to non-specific targets [114]. \n\nIn the context of PLGA particles, researchers have reported that small PLGA particles adhere more strongly to endothelial cells in the presence of IgA-and IgM-depleted serum, which does not occur in the presence of these specific proteins [115]. However, a drawback is observed, as biomolecules may form novel interactions with additional plasma proteins, resulting in the broadening of the initial protein corona. For example, Mirshafiee et al. coated nanoparticles with globulins to increase macrophage absorption [116]. However, the adsorption of extra proteins hindered these globulins from interacting with macrophage Fc receptors. Therefore, any in vitro evaluation of pre-coated nanoparticles should be preceded by their incubation in plasma.",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

The current situation, largely relying on in vitro findings, indicates that the presence of the corona indeed alters the cellular response to NPs. For example, NP opsonization with immunoglobulin reportedly promoted receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages [155]. The presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was shown to suppress protein absorption resulting in a decreased uptake by macrophages [142] and longer circulation times in the blood as well as altered bio-distribution upon injection in mice [155]. \n\nAttempts were also made to coat NPs by specific proteins. For example, transferrin, well known to be internalized via its cognate receptor, was used to create a protein corona and study its effect on cellular uptake [11,12]. To elucidate how the presence of a protein adsorption layer around NPs affects their cellular uptake, Jiang, Nienhaus et al. [12] compared the uptake of small (diameter about 10 nm), carboxyl-functionalized polymer-coated FePt NPs (fluorescently labeled by DY-636 dye molecules in the polymer shell), by live HeLa cells in the presence or absence of human transferrin (TF) and human serum albumin (HSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium. They studied the uptake of the NPs by quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy. For comparison, they also studied the cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled (ca. 1:1 ratio) transferrin and HSA molecules. Whilst transferrin was endocytosed in significant amounts, HSA was barely internalized by HeLa cells under otherwise identical conditions. In contrast, the uncoated NPs were taken up in large amounts, whereas the presence of an HSA or transferrin corona both reduced the amount of endocytosed NPs with the exact causes for this behavior remaining uncertain.",

            "text": "The cellular uptake activity was found to be the highest in Rf-SPIONs, followed by C-and B-SPIONs, respectively, whose protein corona amounts followed the same trend. The breakdown of the interesting proteins showed a similar trend of abundance in each type of coronas (Figure 3E). As the most abundant protein in the serum, we investigated the effects of albumin on the cellular uptake of the SPIONs. The results, shown in Figure S2, indicate no observable effects from the albumin coronas in the uptake of the SPIONs in the breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with prior studies where albumin is reported to affect cellular uptake in negative ways as it has the property of reducing the interaction of the NPs with the surroundings such as other proteins or cell membranes. 44,45 Although not affecting directly, it is possible that albumin acts by reducing the non-specific interaction of the NPs with the cells, thereby allowing the Rf ligand to promote the interaction with the cells and resulting in the enhanced uptake of the Rf-SPIONs. \n\nOther proteins that are possible to involve with the uptake of the NPs are apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E. The proteins were reported to enhance the uptake of NPs into brain tissues due to their specific interaction with the receptors overexpressed in the blood\u2212 brain barrier. 37,46 However, the effects were not demonstrated in breast cancer cells beforehand. \n\nHere, two hypotheses are suggested. One is that the coverage of the coronas did not affect the activities of the Rf ligand in promoting the cellular uptake activities. Another possible explanation is that there are distinct key components in the protein coronas of the Rf-SPIONs which help in increasing the uptake efficiency of the NPs into the cells. This requires further systemic analyses on the development of the coronas in vitro which could give more information on the proteins involved in the cell internalization processes. 47",

            "text": "addition of fetuin into culture medium increased cellular uptake of PF14-SCO nanoparticles and splicing correction by SCO in HeLa pLuc705 cells in SR-dependent manner [52]. Interestingly, in case of human serum, PF14-pDNA nanoparticles demonstrated higher adsorption of most proteins compared to pDNA alone (Table 5), further emphasizing marked differences in composition of protein corona between sera of various mammals. In addition to fetuin, which marks nanoparticles for recognition by macrophages via scavenger receptors, also \u03b1-2-macroglobulin that is abundant in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) might dampen the effect of injected pharmaceuticals, like oligonucleotides, targeting these to elimination as found earlier [77].\n\nTo sum up, serum albumin was a prominent constituent in protein corona forming around CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in all studied sera: from calf, mouse and human, although from mouse serum it did not associate to nanoparticles with the highest yield. However, the protein composition varied extensively between different sera and each protein corona showed individual pattern.\n\nIn addition, the functioning of proteins forming corona around PF14-pDNA nanoparticles in murine serum is in good concordance with the recent reports about the behaviour and targeting [78] of these nanoparticles in vivo. Accordingly, high level of alpha 1antitrypsin in protein corona of PF14-pDNA nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) correlates well with accumulation of nanoparticles in lungs of mice [79]. It was also shown that accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100, [80] and complement component 3 [78] in protein corona targets nanoparticles to liver. In both these organs high expression of luciferase from pGL3 plasmid was observed recently, whereas only low amounts of these nanoparticles were targeted to spleen, kidney, and heart [55,81].",

PC \u2013 when properly tuned \u2013 can serve as a potential avenue for optimization of NPs\u2019 use in cancer therapy. Methods Poly-lactic co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based NPs exhibiting different physicochemical properties were fabricated and characterized. The PC makeup of these NPs were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by Western blot and Bradford assay, respectively. The effect of PC on the release of NPs\u2019 cargos and the intracellular uptake into B16F10 melanoma cells has been studied. Results The composition of NPs (polymeric PLGA NPs vs lipid-polymer hybrid NPs) and the conjugation of an active targeting ligand (cRGDyk peptide) represented the major determinants of the PC makeup of NPs. The in vitro release of the loaded cargos from the NPs depended on the PC and the presence of serum proteins in the release medium. Higher cumulative release has been recorded in the presence of proteins in the case of peptide conjugated NPs, cNPs, while the unconjugated formulations, uNPs, showed an opposite pattern. NPs intracellular uptake studies revealed important roles of distinct serum and cellular proteins on the extent of NPs\u2019 accumulation in melanoma cells. For example, the abundance of vitronectin (VN) protein from serum has been positively related to the intracellular accumulation of the NPs. Conclusion Careful engineering of nanocarriers can modulate the recruitment of some proteins suggesting a potential use for achieving endogenous targeting to overcome the current limitations of targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.",

            "text": ". The presence of many 327 apolipoproteins in LNP coronas correlated with LNP efficacy (-0.1<Orthogonality<0.1). In 328 particular, Apo A-II, B, C-II, and C-IV, the structural proteins found in HDL, VLDL, and 329 chylomicron (CM) lipoproteins, were positively correlated with LNPs performance. Apo M, which 330 is found primarily on HDL 46 , also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In 331 contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV 47 , which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a 332 moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered 333 highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-334 derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig.  335 14). Remarkably, quantitative imaging revealed that LNPs stimulated higher cellular eGFP mRNA 336 expression when supplemented with obese plasmas that resulted in coronas with less ApoE (Fig.  337 1e). As will be shown later, this is also not simply because the obese serum stimulates protein 338 production, but rather that specific plasma components accumulate in LNP coronas and this leads 339 to enhanced LNP function. 340\n\nWhile not all protein components of LNP coronas are strongly correlated with LNP function, the 341 majority of lipids associated with LNPs did correlate with enhanced LNP performance. A lipid-342 rich corona, in general, is favorable for LNP mediated mRNA delivery. However, the 343 orthogonality of lipid hits was higher than most of the protein hits (Orthogonality>0.1 or <-0.1), 344\n\nsuggesting that the corona proteins are more relevant for explaining the differences between LNP 345 function in lean and obese contexts. The plasma lipids became more relevant (orthagonality 346 dropped below 0.1 in most cases) when considering particle uptake as opposed to function. While 347 particle uptake was not our primary readout, it is interesting that PC, for example, has previously",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

[90]enerally, the mere presence of a certain lipid does not reliably predict enrichment of the theoretically associated serum protein, given that its surface display is a prerequisite.This adds complexity to the translation of findings across different NPs, since not only the components but also their ratios affect their struc-tural organization, [91] and consequently, the corona formation of these particles.Thus, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between NP structure and corona composition is essential.Expanding on this, the presence of certain proteins within the corona does not imply a functional role.Indeed, protein binding to NPs can cause structural alterations of said proteins, rendering them biologically inactive. [92]While it is exceedingly challenging to predict how the protein corona might alter the NPs fate, incremental progress in understanding presents opportunities for novel therapeutic and diagnostic avenues.\n\nThus far, endogenous targeting has proven effective in directing NPs to the liver, spleen, and lungs.To extend the application of this strategy toward additional tissues, further investigations connecting protein corona composition and biodistribution are required.",

The term \"nanoparticle protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles when they are present in biological environments, such as blood or tissue (Mahmoudi et al., 2023). This corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' biological behavior, affecting their circulation time, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in drug delivery applications (Monopoli et al., 2012;Lynch et al., 2006;Walczyk et al., 2010). Overview of the general experimental workflow for RES blockade in vivo experiments. NU/NU mice bearing PC346C tumors were systemically injected with dextran sulfate (30 mg/kg), liposomes (360 mg/kg) or PBS (control), followed by i.v. injection of siAR-PEG-DSG-LNPs containing 0.2 % DSPE-Cy5.5 at a dose of 5 mg/kg siRNA. Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification.

            "text": "The study of PC composition by in vitro assays could be very important to define the targeting ability of LNPs before the in vivo administration. The O-and N-LNP formulations developed by Qiu et al. [1] could be used to obtain a specific targeting to the liver and lung, respectively, thanks to their specific interaction with serum proteins. This interesting study suggested that specific formulation competencies are one of the key factors for LNP optimization, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary collaboration between researchers. \n\nLNP-related PC compositions resulted differently when studies were conducted in vitro or in vivo: Amici et al. [129] demonstrated that only 40% of total protein content was in common between in vitro and in vivo coronas and the in vitro PC resulted in being enriched in higher molecular weight with respect to the in vivo PC. Scientific evidence also demonstrated that in vivo formed LNP-PC presented higher heterogeneity and less amount of complement proteins, which could probably be correlated with a prolonged LNP blood circulation after the administration [129,132]. The in vivo formed PC showed a lower amount of coagulation proteins that are directly involved in the activation of immune system cells by Toll-like receptors; overall, less enrichment in complement and coagulation protein could reduce the particle uptake by immune cells increasing the circulating time [129]. In vivo, PC resulted in being enriched in lipoproteins with respect to the in vitro counterpart, while neither of the two PCs were enriched in immunoglobulins. \n\nMuch data on PC composition are published and it is possible to conclude that LC-MS/MS analyses resulted in faster, cleaner, and simpler measurements to obtain information from complex biological samples but the critical aspect is the nature of considered PC; only a few data are reported on in vivo formed LNP-PC and further research will be needed to understand the effect of many factors, such as the administration route, the LNPs' compositions, and the presence of any pathologies, on PC composition, and consequently, on the fate of LNPs once administered.",

Adsorption of proteins like fibrinogen or ribonuclease A to nanomaterials can also lead to destabilisation of their structure, e.g. by partial unfolding altering their function and promoting particle aggregation.

For instance, protein adsorption on nanoparticles with high curvature actually improves protein stability and retains enzymatic functions, for example, for soy bean peroxidase, lysozyme and human carbonic anhydrase. 56 Pre-coating of nanoparticles with a single protein-like albumin has been shown to increase colloidal stability and reduce binding of opsonins (C3, IgGs), consequently reducing nanoparticle uptake by macrophages. 59 Protein coating of nanomaterials can also be further exploited for the attachment and proteolytic release of drugs. 60,61 An increasing number of studies have revealed that the composition and presence of a protein corona is dependent on the nanoparticle size, charge, shape, surface functionalization and incubation time. 54,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71] While most studies have suggested a limited complexity of protein coronas of several dozens of proteins, a recent quantitative proteomic study identified up to 300 different proteins in the protein corona of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles. 68 Protein adsorption from serum occurred within minutes and the corona composition changed little with prolonged exposure time.

            "text": "To further investigate the protein corona composition, proteins are typically separated and desorbed from purified protein-nanoparticle complexes. We utilized the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method by cutting protein gel bands and then performing protein sequencing using LC-MS/MS, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of PCs (Figure 3). The current mechanisms underlying how the protein corona affects cell metabolism are not yet clear. It is known that proteins in the corona on nanoparticles can interact with other biomolecules inside and outside the cells. The intracellular protein corona regulates the macrophage phenotype and induces stress responses in endothelial cells. We believe that intercellular proteins replace some proteins from the surface of nanoparticles, disrupting protein homeostasis, subsequently triggering the \"Neutrophil activation involved in immune response\", \"Respiratory vesicle lumen\", \"Cytoplasmic vesicle lumen\", and \"Secretory granule lumen\" pathways (Figure 4). The PC-induced neutrophils impact the cellular clearance pathways of nanoparticles and alter cell metabolism. Currently, the targeted delivery of nanomedicines still presents significant challenges. Research by Wilhelm et al. has shown that only 0.7% of nanomaterials can be effectively transported to specific target sites [25]. Ideally, drugs should be enriched in target organs while minimizing accumulation in other tissues. However, in most cases, the formation of the protein corona weakens the targeting ability of nanomaterials. This is because the PC covers the surface of the nanomaterial carrying ligands, creating a barrier between the ligands and target cells, impeding their mutual recognition and reducing targeting efficiency. Therefore, in the follow-up experiments, we will knock out or inhibit proteins such as F-actin, Coronin, vATPase, TUBA, TUBB, MHCII, and TSP to elucidate the impact of these protein coronas on the mechanism of cellular phagocytosis.",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

These unique properties also have significant effects on the composition and structure of the protein corona formed around these NPs in a biological environment. Herein, protein corona formation on albumin NPs and liposomes was simultaneously evaluated through in vitro and simulation studies. The sizes of both types of NPs increased with more negatively charged interfaces upon being introduced into fetal bovine serum. Gel electrophoresis and label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to identify proteins recruited to the hard corona, and fewer proteins were found in albumin NPs than in liposomes, which is in accordance with isothermal titration calorimetry. The cellular uptake efficiency of the two NPs significantly differed in different serum concentrations, which was further scrutinized by loading an anticancer compound into albumin NPs. The presence of the hard protein corona increased the cellular uptake of albumin NPs in comparison with liposomes. In our simulation study, a specific receptor present in the membrane was greatly attracted to the albumin-apolipoprotein E complex. Overall, this study not only evaluated protein corona formation on albumin NPs, but also made promising advancements toward albumin- and liposome-based therapeutic systems.",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been significant advancement in comprehending the corona-mediated in vivo fate and its correlation with NP composition.However, the strategies to manipulate the protein corona remain limited, with PEGylation being the main strategy to extend blood circulation time as evidenced the number of marketed PEGylated NPs. [17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.",

As already observed for similar studies, although most of the proteins were present in both coronas, the relative abundance of some of them was very different between the two samples. For instance, while apolipoprotein B-100 content was comparable in the two cases, the histidine-rich glycoprotein was particularly enriched in the corona formed at high serum amount, and vice versa apolipoprotein A-I content was much higher in the corona formed in low serum.\n\nNanoparticle Uptake Efficiency in Situ and after Corona Isolation.

Albumin binding to synthetic layered silicate NPs (LSNs) induced protein unfolding akin to heat denaturation of albumin. Class A scavenger receptors, which are the dominant receptors involved in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), required the presence of the albumin corona to recognize the LSNs. \n\nThe conformational changes of albumin can not only lead to increased NP clearance, but also alter their cellular uptake. A study characterized the biomolecular corona of negatively charged disulfide-stabilized poly (methacrylic acid) nanoporous polymer particles (PMA SH NPPs) following incubation in complete media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Adsorption of BSA, a major component in FBS, onto the surface of the NPPs was found to result in a conformational change from its native state. Notably, denatured BSA on NPPs caused a reduction in the internalization efficiency of the NPs into human monocytic cells, compared to the bare particles, due to reduced cell membrane adhesion. However, a different conformation of BSA, triggered class A scavenger receptor-mediated phagocytosis in differentiated macrophage-like cells (dTHP-1) without a significant impact on the overall degree of cell internalization. Recognizing that both composition and orientation of the protein corona are important for the assessment of biological interactions may lead to the prevention of off target cellular interactions of NPs (Yan et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated that anionic liposomes modified with PEGs could achieve enhanced clearance at the site of subcutaneous administration and increased retention in the lymph nodes when compared to liposomes that were not modified. Liposomes modified with shorter PEG chains exhibited higher retention but lower clearance in the lymph nodes compared to liposomes modified with longer PEG chains. Therefore, the targeting behavior and transfection capability of LNPs can be significantly influenced by the selection of a linear or branched PEG chain [110]. In addition to passive cellular uptake and prolonged circulation, nanoparticle uptake into target cells can be improved by attaching a receptor ligand to the particle surface. Enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells can be achieved through methods other than relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake, such as utilizing a receptor ligand that is conjugated to the particle surface. The incorporation of targeting ligands into lipid-based nanoparticles is a strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems to specific tissues or cells, including the lymph nodes and other desired locations. The ASSET platform (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting) was developed through the conjugation of anti-Ly6C antibodies onto lipid-based nanoparticles that were loaded with siRNA, which selectively targets inflammatory leukocytes in vivo [111,112]. Cell-penetrating peptides have demonstrated their effectiveness in facilitating the intracellular delivery of a diverse range of pharmacologically interesting molecules across various types of cells and show promise in enhancing the intracellular delivery of a wide array of biologically active agents [113]. LNPs have been modified with cell-penetrating peptides, such as R8 and GALA, to improve the uptake of these particles in dendritic cells and to enhance the immune response [114]. The exposure of LNPs to biological fluids causes the biomolecules to be rapidly adsorbed onto their surface, generating the protein corona. Initially, the protein corona comprises significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment. As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115].",

            "text": "It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (64), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (65) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (65). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (33) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density. Thus, it appears that ApoE exerted distinct functions on NPs with low and high PEG densities. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that apolipoproteins involved in the trafficking of lipids in the bloodstream also impact on the in vivo clearance of NPs. \n\nOnce inside the cell, it is presumed that the protein corona is removed in phagolysosomes, causing the true \"identity\" of the NPs to be revealed (66).",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 4 protein corona formation had a major impact on the cellular uptake towards HeLa cells. Therefore, we aimed to deeply investigate the interaction of the protein nanocapsules with blood proteins. All nanocapsules were incubated with human serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Protein corona coated nanocapsules were isolated via centrifugation and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S4-6 \u2020), Pierce Assay (Fig. S3 \u2020) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 6). A full list of all identified proteins is provided in a separate supporting Excel Sheet. \n\nAll corona proteins identified by mass spectrometry were classified into eight different protein groups depending on their biological function and are summarized in Fig. 6. We found that regardless of the protein type and crosslinker, there was no specific enrichment of one or two major protein classes in the protein corona of all nanocapsules (see also protein corona profiles Fig. S4-S6 \u2020). This is in strong contrast to other nanocarrier systems such as nanocapsules prepared from hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 43,44 or polystyrene nanoparticles. 30,45 Generally, for those systems, one or two protein groups (e.g. lipoproteins or serum albumin) are the dominant class proteins with an overall amount between 50-70%. Next to this, the absolute amount of corona proteins (Fig. S3 \u2020), which bound to all protein nanocapsules was comparable (<500 \u00b5g m \u22122 surface area) and significantly lower compared to polystyrene nanoparticles (\u223c2-3 mg m \u22122 ) or HES nanocapsules (\u223c1 mg m \u22122 ). This could possibly be a result of different hydrophilicities of the materials and the fact that proteins are natural molecules also occurring in the human body. This was already found for other nanocarriers made from  \"body-similar\" components. 30,46,47 However, having a closer look at the individual protein classes, we found that the crosslinker type (TAD vs. TDI) had an influence on the relative amount of specific protein classes.",

            "text": "As has been reported, the nanoparticles are inevitably decorated with biological macromolecules when they are dispersed in the physiological media (for instance, human serum) and subsequently developing the socalled \"protein corona\". 74 The biological decoration of the nanoparticles renders their bio-chemical-physical properties, ultimately altering the functionalities and behaviors in cell targeting, systemic circulation, fibrillation, cellular uptake, and biocompatibility. The protein coronas structurally and morphologically transform nanoparticles beyond recognition as compared to the original as-synthesized counterpart. Consequently, the effects of bio-decoration on a variety of nanoparticle properties have been extensively studied in many biomedical applications, such as bio-detection, nano-therapeutics, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. 75\u00c079 For cancer cell targeting, the protein corona on the surface of nanoprobes poses a dual-effects (Figure 2B). However, the level of corona influence during CTC isolation can be adjusted by modifying the physiochemical properties of the nanoprobes. Professor Caruso's group at the University of Melbourne demonstrated the impact of serum proteins on the targeting efficacy of the antibody-grafted inorganic microspheres. 80 It was found that in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA) alone, protein coronas exhibited a favorable effect onligand-receptor interaction, while in the condition of many types of serum proteins, the targeting ability was eliminated due to alteration of the nanoprobe surface properties. In contrary, in the case of small molecular weight targeting ligands like transferrin or nanobody, the negative influence of the protein corona on the targeting ability is amplified to some degree (Figure 2B). 81,82 ince most of the serum protein molecules display a negative potential, they tend to bind onto the positivelycharged nanoparticles by forming a protein corona. This is a critical issue in charge-based CTC detection and isolation as the protein corona can significantly alter the overall nanoprobe charge conditions. We investigated the effects of hard and soft protein corona formed on the positively-charged (MNCs\u00c8) and the negatively-charged magnetic (MNCs\u00c9) nanoprobes in the PBS solution with different FBS concentrations and its influence on the capture efficiency of HeLa cells. 68",

            "text": "Understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems is becoming increasingly relevant in many biomedical research areas such as targeted drug delivery, 1 vaccine development, 2\u22124 etc. However, it is well acknowledged that these interactions are exceedingly complicated to investigate, mostly caused by the heterogeneous nature of biological systems, such as the existence of numerous cell types with varying characteristics and multitudes of key environmental factors. 5 For targeted drug delivery, for example, a drug-loaded NP injected into a blood vessel will circulate through the body until it reaches the target organs or cells. However, as they travel through the bloodstream, they come into contact and interact with the immune system, which consists of diverse immune cells with varying phenotypes. 6\u22128 The interactions between the NPs and these immune cells begin with endocytosis, followed by intracellular trafficking and exocytosis, which are thought to be highly dependent on the types of immune cells as well as the physicochemical properties of the NPs and may result in significant variations in cytotoxicity. 6,7,9 However, this is an ideal scenario for targeted drug delivery, and many other environmental factors exist in real-world clinical situations. Proteins in biological fluids, for example, can adsorb on the surface of NPs, forming a \"protein corona\", and influence the NP's subsequent interactions with biological cells. 9\u221211 For instance, during the preparation of nano-drugs, fetal bovine serum (FBS) (or bovine serum albumin [BSA]) has been often used to stabilize dispersions of NPs, 12,13 and these FBS-derived protein coronas are thought to modulate the surface functionality and agglomeration behaviors of NPs and affect the cellular association process and cytotoxicity of NPs. 10 Previous studies on these FBS-derived protein coronas have identified albumin, opsonin [e.g., immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antibodies], complement proteins, and apolipoproteins as the major components of the protein corona, 14\u221222 and a subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) study confirmed albumin as the most dominant protein adsorbed on the surface of Au NP",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

            "text": "Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",

            "text": "As mentioned, naturally derived biopolymer-based NPs, specifically protein-based NPs, have many intrinsic characteristics that make them advantageous for targeting certain cell types. For example, they can be both genetically and chemically modified to display cell-targeting ligands on their surface [140]. Depending on the protein, they can be tuned to express a positive or negative surface charge, as cells are slightly negatively charged, and some therapeutics can be ionically bound to the surface of NPs based on charge alone [140]. In vivo, these surface charges will change largely based on the protein corona, which describes the layer of proteins that assemble on the surface of the particle after the introduction of the particle to physiological fluids [141]. This protein layer is governed by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticle, such as surface charge and hydrophobicity, and it greatly impacts how readily the particles are cleared by the immune system; adsorbed immunoglobulins on the particle surface can result in them being cleared by the immune system, for example [141]. Therefore, the protein corona is critical for understanding and controlling cellular uptake and reaching target tissues. \n\nWith protein-based particles, namely SF or SS, surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity can be more readily tuned, allowing for potential control of the protein corona in vivo [140,142,143]. Without characterizing the protein corona, the translation of targeted drug delivery using NPs from bench-to-bedside becomes challenging [144]. The significance of the protein corona varies depending on the target organ or area of the body. Specifically, when considering the skin, the protein corona plays a pivotal role in nanoparticle interactions and responses. \n\nSkin, being the outermost barrier of the body, interacts significantly with external agents. External factors, such as exposure to sunlight, sweat, or environmental pollutants, may alter the composition of the protein corona in nanoparticles applied to the skin. Different skin cell types or skin states (healthy vs. wounded) may respond differently to nanoparticles based on the protein corona, affecting aspects such as inflammation and allergic reactions. Understanding the protein corona's role in cellular interactions helps in designing nanoparticles for effective skin delivery of drugs or therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nThe surface modifications of iLNPs used for mRNA vaccine delivery may affect the biodistribution, lymphatic transport, and cellular uptake by innate immune cells. The surface decoration of nanoparticles with PEG is widely used as a strategy to prevent aggregation of nanomaterials and support distribution into the lymphatic system, while slowing opsonization processes and reducing clearance by phagocytic cells (Suk et al., 2016). However, iLNPs in the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are engineered with PEG-containing lipids with a short hydrophobic anchor. Therefore, these PEG lipids are expected to rapidly desorb from the iLNPs, subsequently allowing endogenous proteins and lipids present in the extracellular space to efficiently bind and form a ''biomolecular corona'' around the iLNP (Dilliard et al., 2021;Mok et al., 1999). Complement fragments, immunoglobulins, and lipoproteins are among the most abundant proteins binding to mRNA-iLNPs upon exposure with blood-derived fluids (Francia et al., 2020). Although there is a dearth of information on the role of protein/iLNP interactions in lymphatic and cellular transport, it is possible that opsonization of mRNA-iLNPs drives receptor-mediated recognition and uptake by innate immune cells. For example, after intravenous delivery of mRNA-iLNPs, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enables receptor-mediated binding and uptake of the particles by the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) into hepatocytes (Akinc et al., 2010;Dilliard et al., 2021). Consistent with this, incubation of iLNPs with ApoE promotes mRNA delivery into dendritic cells (DCs) in cell culture experiments (Pardi et al., 2015). Particle size also dictates the cellular uptake and transport of nanoparticles into LNs (Maisel et al., 2017;Manolova et al., 2008;Oussoren and Storm, 2001;Reddy et al., 2006).",

            "text": "When nanotechnology-based delivery systems reach systemic circulation, they interact with the biomolecules present in blood, mainly with proteins that bind to the nanoparticle surface and form the so-called protein corona (Figure 3a) [88]. Protein absorption is governed by van der Waals, hydrophobic and electrostatic forces. The composition of this protein corona is highly dynamic and dependent on the charge, size and hydrophobicity of the nanoparticle surface [89]. \n\nDepending on the composition, the protein corona can have different effects on the fate of nanoparticles. Some proteins, such as complement factors and immunoglobulins, called opsonins, can facilitate the uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic system leading to a decreased half-life and the activation of the immune response [90,91]. Opsonisation induces nanoparticle uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system, including Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver and spleen. Opsonisation leads to an evident biodistribution of nanoparticles that accumulate in these organs. \n\ntion induces nanoparticle uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system, including Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver and spleen. Opsonisation leads to an evident biodistribution of nanoparticles that accumulate in these organs. On the contrary, protein corona formation can have certain advantages if formed by specific proteins. It can help the nanoparticle evade the immune system because, if nonimmunogenic self-proteins envelop the nanoparticle, it will hide the nanoparticle's surface and not trigger an immune response. The protein corona, in some cases, can also increase the uptake of the nanoparticles by target cells. For example, if the nanoparticle is coated with albumin, this can increase internalization into cancer cells. Tumours naturally uptake higher quantities of albumin than normal cells because they need nutrients to sustain their rapid growth [92]. Furthermore, it is possible to modulate the surfaces of nanoparticles to increase interaction with selected proteins such as albumin [93].",

            "text": "Our results indicated that the composition of protein corona formed on PEG-PLA nanoparticles varied under different loading and multiple dosing condition. The specific corona composition we found can affect the cellular uptake and, as a result, nanoparticles can be internalized via different mechanisms when adsorbed with different protein coronas. This could subsequently affect the brain delivery and microglia targeting efficiency of nanoparticles. \n\nMany studies have shown that the adsorbed opsonins (such as complement proteins and immunoglobulins) can interact with immune cells via membrane receptors and subsequently induce phagocytosis of the nanoparticles 6,45,56 . Despite that PEGylation can reduce the binding of plasma proteins 24 , our studies demonstrate that complement proteins and immunoglobulins are enriched in the corona of nanoparticles incubated with 7d-plasma. We found that both complement activation and Fcg receptormediate phagocytosis are involved in the internalization of nanoparticles in b.End3 cells, which may contribute to the process of crossing BBB. Moreover, complement activation is related to the internalization of nanoparticles in BV-2 cells, which may contribute to accessing microglia. However, repeated injection of PEGylated nanopharmaceuticals may also lead to unexpected immune-mediated side effects such as allergic responses, due to anti-PEG antibodies triggered complement activation 6,57 . Thus, a balance between their side effects and the benefit of targeting is necessary to be considered in engineering the nano-surface of drug delivery systems. \n\nAdditionally, our results show that RAB5A and CD36 in the corona can enhance the cellular uptake of aM-loaded nanoparticles in both b.End3 and BV-2 cells. RAB5A has been reported to be associated with the fusion of plasma membranes and early endosomes 38 . It is the major regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis 58,59 , which may be the pathway involved in nanoparticles uptake. CD36 is a kind of integral proteins expressed on the membrane of macrophages, endothelial and microglial cells.",

These interactions can enhance the uptake of LNPs by target cells, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic payloads such as nucleic acids or drugs. Since surface charge, size and lipid components of nanoparticles have been reported to modulate delivery to specific organs, researchers have created some modified LNPs that interact with endogenous proteins to provide tissue specificity [120,141]. When LNPs have a neutral surface charge, the formation of complexes between LNPs and apoE facilitates transport to the liver and uptake by hepatocytes and hepatoma cells through LDL receptors [202]. LNPs conjugated with apoE are successfully targeted the central nervous system, crossing the bloodbrain barrier and releasing an anticholinergic drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease [203]. In contrast, LNPs with anionic charge can be utilized to facilitate delivery to spleen via adsorption to \u03b22-glycoprotein I [204,205]. In addition, the different phospholipids not only affect LNP tissue-tropism but may also interfere with the biological process of protein translation [206].",

            "text": "Nano-sized particles are more biologically active than their micron-sized counterparts. 1 The toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs) is influenced by physicochemical characteristics such as: the primary particle size, agglomeration state, specific surface area, zeta potential, and surface chemistry. 2 Protein adsorption onto NPs in biological fluids has emerged as an important factor to be taken into consideration with regard to the assessment of biological responses to NPs. [3][4][5] Human plasma contains different types and variants of proteins, of which human serum albumin (HSA), fibrinogen (Fib), and \u03b3-globulins (Glbs) are the most abundant. 6,7 Cells used in cytotoxicity studies are usually cultured in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), which is a mixture of various proteins, similar to what is found in human plasma, except for Fib, which is removed from FBS. NPs introduced to the biological environment will inevitably interact with proteins, leading to their adsorption onto the particles. A \"protein corona\" may be formed, which is a complex mixture of adsorbed proteins in equilibrium on the surface of NPs. 4,[8][9][10] The protein corona may alter the size, agglomeration state, and interfacial properties of the NPs, 10 which could potentially affect the cellular uptake of NPs. 3,11 Dovepress Dovepress 688 allouni et al Protein adsorption to a given NP and its influence on the cellular uptake and biological responses in general, are not well elucidated. Until recently, only a few studies have investigated the effect of proteins on the uptake of NPs. Some of these studies revealed that the uptake was enhanced in the presence of serum proteins 12,13 on polystyrene NPs, whereas others showed higher uptake in the absence of serum proteins on polystyrene, 14 silica, 15 polymer, 16 and carbon nanotubes. 17 TiO 2 NPs are being incorporated in a variety of pharmaceutical products, food, and cosmetics. Once inside the body, unintentionally or intentionally, such NPs will inevitably interact with blood proteins.",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": ", functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264]. Despite these difficulties, there are promising examples which have already demonstrated efficient, cell-or tissue-specific delivery of nucleic acids. Additionally, scientists have started to exploit the protein corona to tune particle distribution in vivo. It is commonly known that plasma proteins adsorption depends on particle surface characteristics. Hence, slight structural changes of the particle surface have shown to affect the protein corona composition. As a consequence of protein corona modification, transport to target cells by coating with certain plasma proteins which serve as endogenous ligands can be obtained in vivo. For example, DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes have shown to adsorb vitronectin which mediated receptor-dependent uptake by tumor cells expressing \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrins [265]. Patisiran is another prominent example for targeted transport to hepatocytes, mediated by coating with endogenous ApoE [104,137]. Manipulation of the interaction with receptors in vivo and therefore targeted delivery to other cell types could be achieved by an altered protein corona as a consequence of exchanging certain lipid components of the Patisiran formulation [146]. Additionally, Saunders et al. used \"nanoprimers\" administered shortly before injection of therapeutic LNPs that were taken up by cells of the hepatic RES (Fig. 6B). By inhibiting KCs and LSECs, LNPs could be preferentially delivered to hepatocytes, the desired target site [266].\n\nBased on these observations, methods which enable fast screening of broad libraries of nucleic acid carriers in vivo were developed [106][107][108][109]. By means of that, evaluation and characterization of predominant plasma proteins in the corona and tuning the biodistribution profile based on facile structural variations becomes feasible, pathing the way for improved targeted, cell-specific nucleic acid delivery in vivo (see Fig. 6C) [110,[142][143][144][145].  5 Interaction of i",

            "text": "The therapeutic efficiency of these LNPs in treating inflammatory bowel disease was demonstrated, where targeted expression of interleukin 10 was observed in inflammatory leukocytes that are only present in inflamed tissues [104,105]. \n\nAlthough the inclusion of targeting ligands has been shown to enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficiency of mRNA-LNPs, it should be noted that attaching targeting moieties may add complexity, cost, and regulatory difficulties to the process of manufacturing LNP systems [106]. In addition, the targeting specificity of some targeting ligands may disappear when lipid nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids where interaction with proteins in the media and the consequent formation of protein corona takes place [107]. Therefore, a compromise between the possible clinical benefits and the complexity and cost of the targeted mRNA-LNP manufacture should be taken into consideration. \n\nSome studies proposed that interaction of nanoparticles with opsonic blood proteins (i.e., opsonization) can be employed as a passive approach for targeting antigen-presenting cells [108,109] or to generate potent activation of dendritic cells through complement interactions in vaccine platforms [110]. A study conducted by Reddy et al. [110] demonstrated that intradermal injection of ultra-small ovalbumin nanoparticles as a vaccine platform resulted in targeting and activation of the dendritic cells residing in lymph nodes through complement interactions [110]. The authors concluded that intradermal administration of ovalbumin nanoparticles into mice may induce only humoral immunity via targeting lymph nodes and complement activation. \n\nThe differences in site-specific targeting and organ distribution after systemic administration of mRNA-LNP formulations can be attributed to the biomolecular corona and surface charge of LNPs. For example, adsorption of apolipoprotein E as a targeting ligand led to specific hepatic uptake of (si)RNA from ionizable (or near neutral) LNPs, but not from cationic LNPs [111].",

            "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

            "text": "After intravenous injection, the occurrence of a protein corona on the surface of the nanoparticles is a very well documented phenomenon that eventually can change the delivery and the targeting properties of the carriers, favoring their sequestration in the MPS [130]. As albumin is the major protein component of the serum, it is usually involved in this phenomenon. On the other hand, supporting the formation of a pure albumin corona on the particle surface can increase the circulation properties of the carriers, as well as the targeting of Gp60 and SPARCS. To this goal, an albumin-binding domain was efficiently used to functionalize PXT-loaded micelles, increasing their cancer accumulation and cytostatic effect in an in vitro and in vivo model of breast cancer [131]. The group of Dr. Yoon developed a theranostic tool able, in the presence of albumin [132], to exploit the avidity, of the tumor tissue for this protein. The system is composed of nanovesicles of phthalocyanine that in an aqueous solution have self-assembly in nanostructures, but when injected, disassemble to bind albumin, generating ROS and infrared fluorescence. Endogenous albumin was also harnessed to develop a more effective cancer vaccine exploiting the long circulation time of this protein, as well as its continuous perfusion of the lymph nodes [133]. The system was based on Evans blue conjugated with different adjuvants and antigens to exploit the high affinity of this dye for circulating albumin. \n\nOn the other hand, albumin can be used as a functional component in the synthesis of nanoparticles, as it was shown to increase nanoparticle dispersity and stability while adding a new layer of loadable modifiable material [134]. The adsorption of albumin on the surface of nanoparticles occurs naturally through hydrophobic and electrostatic bonds, because of the amphipathic character of this protein. However, some authors report that emulsion-solvent evaporation and microemulsion techniques provide a more efficient formation of albumin coating [135].",

            "text": "Supplementary mechanisms, like the \"hitchhiking\" effect of immune cells and active transcytosis by tumor endothelial cells, also contribute to Sequential biological barriers to site-specific drug delivery. After intravenous administration, nanoparticles face multiple obstacles, including opsonization, uptake by macrophages, nonspecific accumulation in organs like the spleen and liver, and challenges in margination dynamics. Additionally, high tissue pressure and cellular barriers such as internalization, endosomal escape, and drug efflux pumps hinder effective targeting and delivery. Adapted from (171, 172). \n\nthe accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors, overcoming the limitations of the EPR effect. After discussing the role of PEGylation and alternative hydrophilic polymers in enhancing circulation time and reducing undesired uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), it is crucial to consider another pivotal factor influencing nanoparticle behavior in the bloodstream: the formation of a protein corona. Upon entering the biological milieu, nanoparticles rapidly associate with various proteins in the serum, forming what is referred to as the protein corona (69). This protein layer significantly influences the biodistribution, cellular uptake, and interactions of nanoparticles with target cells (70). For instance, the presence of a protein corona can either enhance or hinder the targeting of nanoparticles to specific cell populations (71). Understanding and controlling the formation of the protein corona is crucial for optimizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems, especially in precise mitochondrial targeting strategies. By finely tuning the surface characteristics and size of nanoparticles, the composition and structure of the protein corona can be manipulated, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing non-specific interactions (72,73). This is a pivotal step in advancing mitochondrial-targeted nanotherapeutics and their clinical applications, ensuring higher precision and reduced toxicity in treatments.",

            "text": "espite the presence of IR and BC proteins, dysopsonins such as serum albumin were also found in the coronas of all samples. Albumin, as one of the most abundant proteins in serum tends to have high affinity with NPs and has shown to be useful in stabilizing the NPs and prolong their blood circulation time in vivo. 33,34 Clusterin was another type of protein found in all coronas. The protein was also reported to have dysopsonic properties, giving stealth effects to the NPs against phagocytosis. 35,36 Therefore, the presence of the albumin and clusterin could counter the activities from the IR and BC proteins mentioned above. Apolipoprotein is another interesting group of proteins. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E have been reported to have opsonin-like properties. 37 Despite that fact, the proteins also proved to be enhancing the abilities of NPs to cross the blood\u2212brain barrier through interactions with brain endothelial cells. 38,39 Therefore, enrichment of these lipoproteins could not only affect the circulation time of the SPIONs but also be beneficial when targeting the NPs to brain tissues. \n\nBy comparing the abundance of each discussed protein between each type of coronas (Figure 3E), B-SPIONs have the least affinity with the proteins, followed by the C-and Rf-SPIONs, respectively. This is in good agreement with the prior results observed from SDS-PAGE where the lane intensities followed the same trend (Figure 2). Although the physical properties and number of types of the proteins found on each SPION were not much different (Figure 3A\u2212D), the higher abundance of each protein suggested the effects of the coating materials such as citric acid and the Rf conjugate increasing the interaction of the SPIONs to the serum proteins. This increase in protein corona abundances could have a high influence on the NP behaviors when they are introduced in vivo, especially in terms of biodistribution and circulation time.",

Among these, endocytosis is a crucial pathway where adhesive interactions of nanoparticles or cell membrane inactive permeation occur with channel-or transporter proteins. 0][51] Previously, latex beads <200 nm in size were taken up by mammalian HeLa cells and Caenorhabditis elegans coelomocytes via endocytosis. 52 ell types influence the mode of cellular uptake, as well as the particle physicochemical properties. Polystyrene nanoparticles (120 nm) surface-modified with amidine groups can permeate rat alveolar epithelial cells via non-endocytic pathways. 53,54 In a recent study, plastic polymer signatures (\u2265700 nm) were detected in the digested blood of 22 healthy volunteers. 55 However, the particle size distribution of these polymers is unknown. Moreover, most studies used polystyrene particles; therefore, looking at the cellular uptake process of other types of MPs particles is important.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44]. The protein corona on the NP surface is hypothesised to hinder interactions of nanoparticle ligands and the targets on the cell surface [44,47]. \n\nThe study of Mirshafiee et al. [44] found that the protein corona formed on BCN-NPs (NPs functionalized with bicyclononyne) incubated in medium with 10% serum and 100% serum consisted of abundant proteins, such as chain A, a novel allosteric mechanism in haemoglobin, fetuin, haemoglobin foetal subunit beta or apolipoprotein A-II precursor. It was also reported that \u226588% of proteins in BCN-NP coronas had a molecular weight below 30 kDa. Even relatively low molecular weight proteins created corona that significantly reduced NP targeting efficiency [44]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (HiPco\u00ae) were also found to interact with cell culture medium and its components. Casey et al. described that SWCNT interacted with the medium via physisorption through van der Waals forces [26,48]. \n\nThe process of protein corona formation has a decisive influence on nanoparticle-induced toxicity. For example, silica nanoparticles (AmSil30) precoated with human plasma caused lower cell-death induction in primary human endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cell line (ISO-HAS1). The resulting effect was dependent on the time of corona formation. The most significant effect was recorded for the early corona, but prolonged incubation with plasma (>30 min) did not counteract membered toxicity [49]. In another example, thrombocytes were used to study the protein corona effect on the biological model. In the latter study, nanoparticles exposed to human plasma for 0.5 min did not activate thrombocytes to form aggregates due to the presence of the plasma protein corona [49].",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

Proteins that facilitate uptake are termed opsonins and include complement proteins and immunoglobulins.Nanomaterials with unprotected surface attributes due to the presence of hydrophilic polymers are able to bind extensively to proteins [111], however, experimental evidence in support of the link between specific proteins, or protein profiles, in the corona and nanomaterial toxicity has yet to be generated.The most commonly reported protein-nanomaterial interactions occur between Pluronic \u00ae or Tween \u00ae coated 80 SLN [131], liposomes [132], poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles (NP) coated with PEG [133] and proteins albumin, fibrinogen, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), \u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b12-macroglobulin and immunoglobulin M (IgM) [131][132][133].The experimental significance of the total extent of nanoparticle binding to proteins and the biodistribution to the organs of the MPS, circulation time and inflammation at the site of nanoparticle retention have been elucidated [114].",

The following subtitles embody the latest advances in nanosized particles and protein corona structures for biotechnological applications. \n\nYallapu et al. have investigated the sample of human serum protein corona (HSPC) formation with nanosized particles. The change in particle size, zeta potential, hemotoxicity, cellular uptake/cancer cells targeting potential, and MRI characteristics of nanosized magnetic particles were reduced because of the adsorption of human serum. Meanwhile, associated with raised serum and particle concentrations, Apolipoprotein E (APOE = gene, apoE = protein) is absorbed in the surface of nanosized magnetic particles besides serum albumin (HAS) and transferrin (TF). But there existed no conspicuous primary-secondary structural developments noticed in serum proteins by various approaches, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and circular dichroism (CDS). Hemolysis evaluation offers nearly no hemolysis at the approved concentrations (up to 1 mg/mL) for nanosized magnetic particles compared with the sodium dodecyl sulfate (positive control). Moreover, the developed internalization and uptake of magnetic nanoparticles through the C4-2B cell line appears to have been confirmed during incubation with human serum (HS). Following the adsorption of serum protein to the surface of nanosized magnetic particles, the immediate proximity within T1 (~1.33-1.73 s) and T2(~12.35-13.43 ms) times of relaxation permitted nanosized magnetic particles to maintain intrinsic magnetic resonance imaging potential even after adsorption of biomolecular protein. All high-level clinical parameters could dictate the translation to clinical practice and the use of this formulation for next-generation nanoscience for drug delivery (DD), cancer targeting, imaging, and theranostics applications [107].",

            "text": "However, uniform intratumoral distribution of GNPs with tumor site-specificity and retained accumulation has not yet been achieved according to some recent pre-clinical studies [20,21]. \n\nEvaluating the tumoral distribution of a drug or particle-drug conjugate is an important variable that is often neglected, as most drugs are assumed to distribute homogeneously into a tumor [22]. In previous studies, we demonstrate that GNP cellular uptake [23,24], as well as intratumoral distribution and retention [25,26], is strongly influenced by surface chemistry. We have shown that when GNPs are surface passivated with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein layer, internalization of the particles into cancer cells occurs through larger vesicle formation with reduced gold content per cell, and when injected intratumorally in a murine lung cancer model, the BSA passivated particles diffuse more overtime throughout the tumor tissue [25]. BSA modification shields the metal core and prevents unwanted non-specific adsorption of other agents onto the particles. However, while BSA is inexpensive, easily accessible, and provides a model substrate, its passivation is non-uniform, there is a possibility for other proteins to overcoat the BSA, and it does not bind with high specificity to a receptor target expressed on cancer cells [27]. Compared to passive targeting, active targeting of GNPs is a promising strategy for nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery since it relies on a biological interaction between ligands on the GNP surface and receptors on the targeted cancer cell [28]. Nevertheless, when the GNP surface is functionalized with targeting ligands, such as proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, apatmers, or small molecules, the consequences of the corona must be considered. In fact, non-specific interactions between engineered nanomaterials and the biological microenvironment of the tumor lead to unwanted adsorption of molecules which can mask or displace the conjugated ligands on the GNP surface. Furthermore, uncontrolled or unmonitored changes in nanoscale structure, chemical composition, or molecular conformation may dramatically affect physiological response to a pharmaceutical or nanoscale device [29].",

            "text": "This pathway is different from the clathrin-dependent pathway due to the fact that caveosomes do not deliver their cargo to lysosomes [134,135]. This feature is advantageous in terms of the intracellular trafficking of therapeutic genes. There are two main strategies for targeting LDLR; (1) protein corona-mediated targeting; (2) ligand-based targeting. Once nanoparticles are injected into the systemic circulation, nanoparticles encounter serum components, such as proteins, resulting in the formation of a protein corona on the surface. The formation of a protein corona is critical for the design of efficient and safe nanoparticles for tissue-targeting, nanomedicines, and other applications, so research related to the protein corona is a subject of great interest [136][137][138][139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146]. Although protein corona formation on a nanoparticle surface may adversely affect targeting [147], controlling them can also be applied to achieve more effective targeting [51,54,55,[148][149][150][151][152][153][154]. With regard to the brain targeting through LDLR-mediated transcytosis, it was proposed that the use of certain apolipoproteins, such as ApoE and ApoA1, would be useful as endogenous ligands for crossing the BBB. One such example is polysorbate-80 coated nanoparticles which bind to ApoE and interact with the LDLR, resulting in an increased brain accumulation compared to nanoparticles without ApoE binding or with low levels of ApoE binding [51,[155][156][157]. Below, we also describe the brain targeting strategies that involve a protein corona. Angiopeps, which were derived from the Kunitz domains of aprotinin and other human proteins [158], is known as the most extensively explored ligand for targeting LDLRs for BBB crossing.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation, if properly understood in order to be adopted in the design of NP surface chemistry, is a recently appreciated tactic. Corona formation to favor nanodrug delivery requires prior knowledge to tailor the composition and function of the protein corona, as well as the cellular recognition of nanomaterials to modulate NP interactions. This can be predicted using machine learning methods or obtained by experimental studies [70]. For one, precoating nanoparticles with, for example, plasma immunoglobulin (IgG), forms a stable protein corona, and reintroduction into the plasma can effectively evade immune cell recognition [26]. Similarly, human plasma protein-derived artificial coronas can drastically improve the blood residency and circulation lifetime of liposomes by reducing their interaction with and sequestration by circulatory leukocytes in vivo [71].\n\nPreadsorption of proteins that form biomolecular coronas on NP surfaces can benefit from the intrinsic/active targeting abilities of adsorbed proteins/antibodies. PC-mediated targeted therapy can be achieved on the condition that the proper orientation and accessibility of proteins is preserved to enable correct NP directing to target cells [55]. Along this line, attempts for desired cell targeting by precoating silica NPs with gamma-globulins to form predefined opsonin coronas on the NP surface have failed, since other plasma-adsorbed proteins counteracted the binding of NP-adsorbed immunoglobulins to macrophage surface receptors, and thus, hindered opsonin-induced by macrophages [72]. Another strategy to reduce the shielding effect on NP mistargeting exploits a non-coupling method to decorate NC surfaces with targeting antibodies (anti-CD63) without affecting their functionality, which occurs during the bioconjugation/coupling process or because of protein corona formation. Interestingly, in the presence of 100% serum/plasma, NPs synthetized by chemical engineering lose their targeting abilities, while CD63 antibodies attached to the carboxyl groups of polystyrene NPs are fully functional [73]. The use of \"dysopsonic proteins\" is another way to build PCS. In this respect, molecular simulations and in vitro assessments have revealed an inverse relationship between",

            "text": "With unique physical and chemical properties, engineered nanoparticles display various interactions with biological environments. 1 The nanoparticle/biological interface, which depends on colloidal forces, has received extensive attention in the design of nanocarriers for drug delivery and imaging enhancement. Upon entry into biological environments, different blood proteins would be adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surfaces, depending on the initial physicochemical properties, and form protein coronas, which give them distinct biological identities. Most of these proteins, such as immunoglobins, fibronectin, thrombospondin, and components of the complement system, are opsonins that bind the nanoparticles and recognize the scavenger receptors on the surface of macrophage cells. As a result, the nanoparticles could easily be cleared by macrophage cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). 2 In this regard, most nanoparticles with organic and synthetic surfaces face rapid clearance by organs of the RES after intravenous (IV) injection. In addition, the uncontrollable and unpredictable localization of nanoparticles after IV injection has created a barrier to efficient cancer diagnosis and therapy. Tailoring the physicochemical properties of the engineered nanoparticles has become a major focus of nanomedicine research.\n\nThe protein coronas change the original conformation of the synthetic nanoparticles, and the altered identity plays an important role in biological applications. Recent studies suggest that the composition of the protein coronas and the bio-interactions 4230 gao et al were determined by the original properties of the synthetic nanoparticles. [3][4][5][6] Many physicochemical properties, including size, charge, surface modifications, core compositions, and targeting ligand functionalization can substantially affect the biodistribution of nanoparticles after IV administration. 7 In order to prolong blood residence time, reduce accumulation in RES organs, and eventually increase the targeted efficiency of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, endeavors have been made to search for ideal drug-delivery nanocarriers. Particle size has been considered a key parameter for preparing long-circulating nanoparticles and obtaining improved therapeutic efficacy. It has been reported that the ideal size of nano",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

            "text": "The effectiveness of nanomedicine therapeutic strategies is strictly dependent on the design of the nano formulation since by modulating nanoparticle physicochemical properties it is possible to discriminate between healthy and diseased cells and predict the mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular targeting. However, the translation from in vitro to in vivo studies and from theory to practice is often affected by the complexity of the biological systems with which nanoparticles interact [96]. In personalized medicine, these factors need to be carefully taken into consideration, indeed, drug targeting could be highly affected on the basis of age, sex, target tissues and organs, metabolic differences, and concomitant diseases that can alter different biological parameters. For instance, after systemic administration, nanoparticles are often altered in their outer surface properties by the absorption of serum proteins that can mask the presence of ligands grafted in the nanoparticle surface necessary for a specific cellular targeting. The absorbed proteins, known also as protein corona, could drastically change the characteristics of the nano formulation with consequent hampered cellular uptake, inactivation, and premature elimination [97]. The impact of protein corona formation can be partially overcome by the engineering of nanoparticles possessing a zwitterionic charge in their surface and a global hydrophobic nature [98] or by the insertion of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains with low molecular weight [99]. \n\nBertrand and co-workers tried to understand how the physicochemical properties of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and their interaction with plasma resident proteins could modulate the biodistribution and clearance [100]. The authors found that a low PEG density reduces the nanoparticle clearance whereas a higher PEGylation determines an opposite effect. Interestingly, a total number of 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 represents a threshold value beyond which the circulation time and clearance of the nanoparticle remain almost the same independently from the nanoparticle size. In addition, this threshold value was found to be consistent in organisms possessing different protein phenotypes. On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time.",

This biocorona is a dynamic and complex structure that determines how host cells respond to nanoparticles. Despite the common use of mouse models in pre-clinical and toxicological experiments, the impact of corona formed in mouse serum on the biophysical and biological properties of different size NP has not been thoroughly explored. Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

            "text": "It has also been described that zwitterionic nanoparticles lack a protein corona [29]. Nevertheless, corona formation cannot be completely prevented even with the presence of PEG that reduces protein adsorption without lack of cellular uptake [30]. \n\nThe determination of the corona and the comprehension of its dependence on the nanoparticle properties has become of capital importance in nanoscience as can be stated by the large amount of published papers in the last few years. In this aspect, Lundqvist et al. [31] have reported that even for a specific material type, the size of the particle, and its surface modification can completely alter the protein corona and probably their biological impact. Corona proteins can physically mask the nanoparticle surface, potentially affecting the therapeutic effect of the molecules bound to the nanoparticle surface [32]. On another hand, it has also been described that cellular uptake is strongly related to the nature of the proteins that constitute protein corona [33]. For instance, it has been found that albumin pre-loading increased the macrophage uptake of PPEylated(polyphosphoester) nanocarriers while it was decreased when these same nanocarriers where loaded with clusterin. Sch\u00f6ttler et al. [34] have found that, in presence of proteins, PEGylated nanocarriers incubated with 10% of fetal bovine serum were not taken up by HeLa cells in contrast with the high uptake observed in absence of a previous incubation. Not only altered plasma protein composition due to different diseases affects the protein corona but also, the composition of the corona varies among healthy individuals [35]. Thus, the protein source is a crucial factor in the formation of the corona. \n\nThe protein corona-nanoparticle conjunction has raised the interest of many groups regarding not only liposomes but other organic (nanorods, carbon nanotubes) or inorganic particles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanobones) [36][37][38][39].",

            "text": "One of the main issues relating to the clinical translation of NCs is represented by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the interaction between NCs and biological fluids. In particular, the high protein concentration of the physiological environment greatly affects the NCs' biological behavior. Indeed, in response to the characteristics of the administered nanoparticles, endogenous proteins promptly adsorb on the surface, creating the so-called protein corona (PC). As established by several groups, this layer is highly dynamic, and its composition is strongly influenced by the biological milieu [15,16]. The protein adsorption impacts particle size, stability, surface properties, and defines the NCs' biological identity and, therefore, their fate [13]. For instance, binding with opsonins (e.g., IgGs and complement proteins), as well as some conformational changes in the attached proteins, trigger NCs uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) [17]. Although in early studies, Cancers 2019, 11, 1855 3 of 21 the PC relevance was confined to some undesirable effects, including NCs clearance and activation of the immune system, it is now believed that in several circumstances, PC also dictates the cellular uptake and intracellular localization of NCs [17][18][19]. While most studies involving nanoparticles as DDSs were originally intended to discourage the protein adsorption by surface coating with hydrophilic polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG; zwitterions; carbohydrates; etc.), more recently, some innovative strategies have attempted to benefit from these spontaneous interactions. Such strategies may be accomplished by promoting the adsorption in vivo or by decorating in vitro the NCs surface with specific proteins, which decrease the MPS uptake and/or preferentially lead to a targeted delivery [20]. A recent example of the latter approach was the regulation of the PC formation by precoating the NCs with a HER2 affibody-glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein. This study demonstrated that the formation of a protein shield reduces the adsorption of serum proteins maintaining the selective targeting ability of the targeting molecule [21].",

The binding of proteins or other biomolecules to nanoparticle surfaces may thereby afford a new \"identity\" to the nanoparticle 24 . Deng et al. 25 showed that poly(acrylic acid)-coated gold nanoparticles bind fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clot formation, in a charge-dependent manner, inducing unfolding of the protein, and that binding to integrin receptors on the surface of the monocytic cell line, THP-1 leads to activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 . However, recent studies suggested clever ways in which to circumvent this problem 31,32 .",

It plays an important role in the colloidal stability of NPs, which is of importance for most of their medical applications and toxicity assessment. While typical studies use either blood plasma or serum from a pooled biobank, it is unclear whether differences in the media, such as cholesterol level or protein concentration, might affect the NP colloidal stability and corona composition. In this study, the silica corona was prepared at particularly low plasma concentrations (3%, v/v\u20131.98 mg/mL) to identify the critical roles of the protein mass/NP surface ratio and the level of plasma cholesterol on the corona protein pattern and particle stability. While depending on the plasma dilution factor, the corona protein composition could be controlled by keeping the protein/NP constant. The NP colloidal stability was found to strongly correlate with the level of cholesterol in human plasma, particularly due to the high enrichment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the corona. A cohort study on plasma samples from individuals with known cholesterol levels was performed to highlight that association, which could be relevant for all corona systems enriched with the LDL.",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

            "text": "Opsonins (i.e., Ig, coagulation, and complement proteins) promote recognition by MPS. In contrast, dysopsonins, such as apolipoproteins and albumin, reduce opsonins' absorption, conferring stealth and decreasing clearance [80]. In line with this, a promising surface modifier should be albumin. Generally, human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) are two types of serum proteins used in constructing or coating NPs, due to properties such as high solubility and long half-life in the blood. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein in the human body, involved in the transport of nutrients and other proteins through the bloodstream. Since albumin is an endogenous protein, it has been widely used as an excipient in clinical formulations mostly for its biocompatibility and less immunogenicity [92]. Several features contribute to using albumin in drug delivery. For example, albumin is exploited by many cancer cells as a source of energy and nutrients, due to the enhanced uptake via macropinocytosis, which is an endocytic process. Its role as dysopsonin in the protein corona contributes to reducing the binding and absorption of other plasma proteins and, consequently, the MPS uptake [93]. For this reason, a preformed protective albumin corona should limit these non-specific interactions and decrease the complement activation. In addition to reducing clearance, albumin also has structural advantages; both amino and carboxylic groups can be employed to functionalize NPs' surface by targeting ligands to facilitate transport and accumulation to the tumor site [89]. Therefore, beyond the improvement of the NPs' half-life, it is crucial to consider the NPs' distribution inside the tumor tissue.",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

            "text": "Although several studies have identified the composition and abundances of adsorbed proteins on NP surfaces, few have been able to distinguish protein patterns, such as multifaceted protein recognition domains, and their roles towards NP recognition pathways by biosystems 32 . Although NPs coated with protein coronas can interact with cell membranes directly through ligand-receptor connections, transient interactions with multiple proteins on the corona can also occur on the membrane. It is possible that the presence of multiple membrane receptors can facilitate the interaction with multiple functional epitopes exposed on the protein corona. These short-lived interfaces can recruit intracellular biomolecules that form cytosolic signal transduction clusters and ultimately bionanosynapse with protein corona-coated NPs, thus preparing cells for ensuing biological impacts 32 . Moreover, there is a knowledge gap in distinguishing all of the multivalent roles of corona proteins with regard to their recognition by cells, in NP pharmacokinetics as well as immunoregulatory signalling and gene expression. Decoding which corona protein pattern impacts cell internalization, biological distribution into tissues and organs and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and genetic material is an extraordinarily challenging question. \n\nDiffering biological and toxicological responses. The identity and nature of the adsorbed corona proteins can mediate biological and toxicological responses; even though the protein corona can provide a protective coating and mitigate cytotoxicity [83][84][85] , it also prompts enhanced toxicity in some cases [86][87][88] . Although there exist several differences in protein corona profiles (such as the presence of rare proteins in some cases) extracted from NP surfaces, multiple studies have confirmed that abundant proteins -such as albumin, fibrinogen, apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transferrin and immunoglobulins -commonly adsorb on NPs because of their relatively high abundance in human serum and plasma 89 . These adsorbed proteins can influence NP physiological responses.",

In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29]. As shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa chain C region) showed that PEGylation reduced the content of the apolipoprotein and has an enriched amount of albumin in the surface compared with NP-DMSA ( Figure 6). Proteins like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins are considered opsonins that promote clearance of NPs via interaction with macrophage receptors [71]. In contrast, the enrichment in dysopsonins proteins like albumin promote prolonged",

            "text": "Background Nanoparticles, which are exposed to biological fluids are rapidly interacting with proteins and other biomolecules forming a corona. In addition to dimension, charge and material the distinct protein corona influences the interplay of nanoparticles with tissue barriers. In this study we were focused on the impact of in situ formed human plasma protein corona on the transfer of 80\u00a0nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-particles) across the human placenta. To study materno-to fetal PS transfer we used the human ex vivo placental perfusion approach, which represents an intact and physiological tissue barrier. To analyze the protein corona of PS particles we performed shotgun proteomics of isolated nanoparticles before and after tissue exposure. Results Human plasma incubated with PS-particles of 80\u00a0nm and subsequent formed protein corona enhanced the transfer across the human placenta compared to PS-corona formed by bovine serum albumin and dextran which served as a control. Quantitative and qualitative changes of plasma proteins determined the changes in PS transfer across the barrier. Based on the analysis of the PS-proteome two candidate proteins, namely human albumin and immunoglobulin G were tested if these proteins may account for the enhanced PS-transfer across the placenta. Interestingly, the protein corona formed by human albumin significantly induced the transfer of PS-particles across the tissue compared to the formed IgG-corona. Conclusion In total we demonstrate the PS corona dynamically and significantly evolves upon crossing the human placenta. Thus, the initial composition of PS particles in the maternal circulation is not predictive for their transfer characteristics and performance once beyond the barrier of the placenta. The precise mechanism of these effects remains to be elucidated but highlights the importance of using well designed biological models when testing nanoparticles for biomedical applications.",

            "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

            "text": "With many excellent properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been treated as promising drug delivery systems for therapeutic purposes, like efficient and safe drug delivery without off-target effects [1,2]. Even though much attention has been paid to the development of NPs, there is still a huge gap between current NP therapy and efficient delivery systems [2]. One of the most critical factors that hinder the clinical translation of NP therapy is the complicated and unpredictable interaction between NPs and biological fluids that occur after the administration of NPs [3]. The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces [4]. This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs [5]. Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity [6][7][8]. As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs [9]. They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the rules and mechanisms of protein corona formation and understand the influence of protein corona in NPs therapy, which will provide guidance for the rational design of NPs and accelerate the clinical translation speed of NP therapy. \n\nThe formation of protein corona is rapid, temporally dynamic, contextually dependent, stochastic, and irreversible [2,10,11].",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "Coating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach. Increased circulation times and brain accumulation are reported for PEG-coated NPs prepared from polycyanoacrylate [173][174][175], poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [176,177], polystyrene [176], and other polymers [178], which is associated with the decreased formation of protein corona and evasion of the MPS. PEG density regulates corona formation and, consequently, particle clearance, of which the threshold for rapid clearance is indicated as 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 for PLGA-PG nanoparticles, largely independent of particle size (diameters of 55, 90, and 140 nm) [177]. No distinguishable difference regarding the composition of the protein corona was observed, although Apo E amounts decrease with increasing PEG density. Moreover, 100 nm diameter polystyrene NPs coated with nine PEG chains per 100 nm 2 showed good diffusion in rat brain tissue ex vivo, as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, as compared with particles with lower densities. Even below the PEG density threshold reported by Bertrand et al., brain diffusion appears to benefit from increased PEG density, which may be attributed to the higher quantity of Apo E in the protein corona and reduced adhesiveness [176,177]. Other surface modification methods to control protein corona formation are surface charge and hydrophobicity modulation [179][180][181]. \n\nParticles' mechanical properties also result in different protein corona profiles, which may affect uptake, toxicity, transport across the BBB, and brain accumulation [44,48,182,183]. Protein adsorption is lower for softer particles, which ultimately leads to a reduced impact of corona-related particle-cell interactions [183,184]. \n\nTargeting capabilities of ligand-decorated NPs are likewise also affected by the presence of a protein corona [75]. Corona formation and the effects on targeting have been evaluated for PEGylated polystyrene NPs functionalized with Tf [74].",

            "text": "In order to investigate the composition of the biomolecular corona in more detail, the serum-incubated NP samples were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In this experiment, the NP-associated biomolecules were separated from the supernatant serum by centrifugation, followed by extensive washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in order to remove serum components with low affinity for the NP surface (\"soft\" corona). Finally, biomolecules retained on the surface of the alendronate-containing BaSO 4 NPs (\"hard\" corona) were detached and denatured by incubating for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in reducing Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 1D SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by visualization of protein bands by staining with a colloidal Coomassie G-250 dye (Figure 8). \n\nAs expected from the previous experiment, a protein corona was formed on the alendronate-containing BaSO 4 NPs. Several distinct bands at ~22, ~38, ~54, ~65, and ~70 kDa corresponding to surface-associated serum proteins were observed, and with increasing serum concentration, the total protein amount clearly increases. In particular, the intensity of the recurring band in the size range of ~65 kDa strongly increases in moving from 40 to 80 % serum. \n\nAlthough the surface of the synthesized BaSO 4 NPs is covered with the hydrophilic alendronate coating, the interaction with biomolecules is not (completely) prevented, most likely due to the surface charge of the NPs. However, the unwanted effect of corona formation has nowadays been transformed into an advantage under certain circumstances and seen as the opportunity to confer extrinsic properties of the cognate corona to the intrinsic functions of the NPs. In other words, the biomolecular corona can be exploited by providing additional features that render nanotherapeutics more effective and precise. For example, a functional protein corona endowing the NPs with both, targeting and immune escape elements, could increase their stability as well as improve their biocompatibility, bioavailability and molecular recognition functions.

However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa chain C region) showed that PEGylation reduced the content of the apolipoprotein and has an enriched amount of albumin in the surface compared with NP-DMSA ( Figure 6). Proteins like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins are considered opsonins that promote clearance of NPs via interaction with macrophage receptors [71]. In contrast, the enrichment in dysopsonins proteins like albumin promote prolonged circulation time in blood by blocking recognition by macrophages and thereby reducing their clearance [57].\n\nTo verify if this small variation in the protein corona of NP-DMSA and NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) is correlated with their biological behaviour, a set of in vitro experiments were carried out. In vitro cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by means of the standard MTT assay. The cell lines used, Caco-2 and RAW 264.7, represent gut epithelia and macrophages, which are two possible targets to encounter the NPs after oral exposure (Gastromark) or intravenous injection (Feridex, Resovist, Combidex) in NMR imaging. The analysis of the degree of survival after incubation with the nanoparticles showed that viability of cell culture was not significantly reduced by the presence of the nanoparticles up to 1 mM of iron concentration after 24 h of treatment (80-100% viability compared with the control) (Figure 7a,b). The effect of functionalization with the diamine PEG derivative was not very clear at high iron concentration. In the case of Caco-2 cells, PEG coating reduced the cytotoxicity for NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) while in RAW 264.7 it had no effect.\n\nproteins were identified in all samples.

            "text": "Proteins and other biomolecules play an important role in regulating the interactions between nanomaterials and macrophages. Plasma is the most important biological medium, in which the total plasma protein concentration is about 60-80 g/L. 21 When the nanomedicine enters into the blood vessel for about 30s, it adsorbs a large amount of proteins on its surface and forms a biocrown. 22 The composition of the biocrown significantly affects the in vivo biological properties of the carrier. First, the binding mode of nanodrugs to plasma proteins is a key factor affecting their recognition by macrophages. It has been shown that adsorption of non-modulin proteins such as serum albumin and apolipoprotein J (Apo J) reduces the carrier-cell membrane interaction and macrophage uptake, and incubation with serum albumin significantly inhibits uptake by dendritic cells. 23 On the contrary, when more conditioning agents, such as complement and immunoglobulin, were adsorbed on the carrier surface, phagocytes could rapidly recognize the nanomedicine, which in turn accelerated its clearance. Secondly, the adsorbed protein crowns can significantly affect the targeting of nanocarriers such as liposomes, eg, Guan et al showed that liposomes modified with cation-rich peptides adsorbed higher amounts of IgG and IgM, which inhibited the targeting of the formulations and enhanced the interaction with immune cells. 24 Therefore, reducing the content of protein crowns or adjusting the adsorbed species can effectively regulate the interaction between carriers and macrophages. 6][27] PEG, as a hydrophilic long-chain polymer, effectively reduces protein adsorption on the surface of nanocarriers. 28 Increasing the density of PEG on gold nanoparticles was shown to significantly reduce serum protein adsorption and uptake by macrophages. 29 However, Schottler et al discovered that the adsorption of a specific quantity of serum proteins could actually enhance the carrier's ability to inhibit macrophage uptake. 30 This finding introduces complexity and raises questions about how protein corona formation influences long-circulation properties. In addition to PEG modification, biomimetic modifications have gained attention.",

Nevertheless, when nanoparticles enter in contact with physiological fluids, the biocorona transforms their surface in their biological identity, meaning that their surface is modified due to the attachment of proteins and other macromolecules from blood and other biological fluids, thus hiding important surface functionalities and hampering their expected biodistribution [12,63]. Moreover, the adsorption of opsonins or other specific proteins might lead to fast clearance from the body. pBAE nanoparticles, as most nanocarriers, include hydrophilic polymers to overcome this common bottleneck step. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is the most extensively used polymer in drug delivery to allow the vectors to circumnavigate biological barriers, decrease the unspecific absorption in non-targeted tissue, and increase the specific cellular uptake [12]. However, PEG can be recognized by the immune system and causes strong allergic reactions in some patients [39,40]. Consequently, extensive work on controlling the formation of the biocorona by tuning the nanoparticle's surface exists in the bibliography. In our first attempts, we worked on tuning nanoparticle surfaces to promote the binding of proteins of interest from the corona. We published this study in 20196, selecting liver targeting as a proof-ofconcept. Being aware that hepatocytes have receptors for the retinol-binding protein (RBD), a protein present in the human serum, we designed a retinol-modified place intending to promote the formation of a corona enriched with RBP. This work demonstrated that we could tune the biodistribution by playing with the protein corona while achieving the envisaged organ targeting. Nevertheless, this strategy is limited to targeting cells with specific affinity proteins in the serum.",

Firstly, the nanomedicines' surface-bound biomolecules impact the circulation time and interaction with the body. Complement proteins can attach to nanomedicines' PC and be exchanged in vivo when nanomedicines are introduced into the blood 265 . Thus, PC improves cellular absorption and phagocytosis of nanomedicines by the MPS, decreases cell membrane adherence, and attenuates cell membrane disruption induced by naked nanomedicines 266e269 . Particularly, nanomedicines' internalization and biodistribution can be significantly influenced by binding proteins 270 . IgG adsorption, complement factors, and fibrinogen, for instance, facilitate the phagocytosis of nanomedicines, while troponins like albumin are hypothesized to increase the circulation of nanomedicines in the blood 271 . Spherical nucleic acids are internalized by macrophage complement receptors, where they are then distributed throughout the liver and spleen 272 . By tuning the corona compositions (e.g., Apos, protein C, and hemoglobin subunits), nano-polyelectrolyte complexes could be imparted with extended circulation duration 273 . When PC was enriched with HSA, dendritic cells' ability to phagocytose nanomedicines was decreased 274 . The prevalence of clusters in PC was shown to limit macrophage absorption of non-specific cells 275 . Complements, immunoglobulins, and immunological antibodies are modulators that cause macrophage absorption and hasten nanomedicine clearance 276 . Therefore, the lifespan of nanoparticles and the mechanisms and effects of PC production must be considered when designing drug delivery systems. \n\nNanomedicines must be delivered to specific cell targets to work effectively. Combined passive and active targeting strategies are used to improve the accumulation of nanomedicines in disease sites. However, PCs may misguide nanocarriers to off-track destinations. For instance, when loaded with biological substances such as human albumins 277 , PC formation dramatically lowers the hepatic retention of gold nanoparticles.",

Our analysis of LNP corona formation indicates that LNPs are associated with HDL particles. This will make the LNPs larger. Interestingly, similar observations to ours, regarding increases in LNP size of up to 120 nm following corona formation, have recently been reported as well 9 . The LNP size increases we observed (using DLS or NTA analysis) following LNP pull-down are, in Simonsen's opinion, excessive. We have previously shown that LNP size does indeed increase in the presence of serum 4 , but the sizes we reported in the current work (Fig. s13 1 ) were obtained, using unfiltered plasma, following the pull-down procedure, in order to characterize the resulting samples. Furthermore, if the pulldown samples were indeed contaminated by lipoproteins, particularly HDL as speculated by Simonsen, the size measurements would likely exhibit a bias towards smaller values-contrary to our observed results. While accurate in situ size measurements of LNPs with coronas were not the main purpose of this procedure, we do find that the LNPs increase in size following exposure to plasma while remaining functionally and structurally intact (in terms of being able to transfect cells and FRET interactions between the LNP cargo and LNP components). \n\nSimonsen also suggests using Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation (AF4) as a standard LNP corona isolation control. In addition to being a relatively slow method unsuitable for high-throughput, we are concerned that particles (endogenous and LNPs) and their coronas may be affected by shear forces during the running and focusing steps and prolonged incubation in a buffer environment. In the study that Simonsen cited, the authors also pointed out that AF4 causes the loss of EVs, for example 10 .",

The nanoparticles also showed prolonged circulation time, thereby increasing the bioavailability and improving the anticancer activity The targeted nanoparticles showed a 60-fold-increased target/healthy tissue (lung/GI) ratio compared to non-targeted nanoparticles [195] Although NPs have emerged as an efficient drug delivery system over conventional delivery systems due to their characteristics (mentioned above) and advantages, a certain fraction of them reaches the clinics. It was further found that due to the presence of a mononuclear phagocytic system, most of the NPs get accumulated in off-target organs after administration, rather than in the target site. One of the reasons for such a scenario is the prevalence of \"protein corona (PC),\" which is described as the array of proteins attached to NPs, affecting its colloidal stability, optimal biodistribution, interactions, and clearance [199]. Moreover, it was established that the assembly of PC and NPs was the first interaction that the NPs experience after entering the body. Thus, to overcome such interactions, various studies were performed, wherein PEGylation was found to be the widely used strategy. But PEGylation also shows some hindrances including a decrease of cellular uptake of NPs by the target cells and the formation of circulating anti-PEG antibodies on the excessive administration of PEGs, thus creating a state of hypersensitivity and compromising the safety of the NPs [200]. Henceforth, such synthetic strategies were overtaken by the biomimetic approaches which include a coating of NPs with cell membrane, application of the virus or its components, and manipulating the integrity of PC [201]. \n\nIt was further revealed that coating the NPs with cell membrane makes the NPs inherent biological identities, aiding the NPs in avoiding opsonization as well as the production of anti-NP immunoglobulins and thus, further facilitating the rapid clearance of NPs [196]. It was not unnoticed that viruses could be considered in the design of drug delivery systems. Viruses and their components were found to interact with the proteins in biological fluids.",

            "text": "One of the main routes for administration of NBMs for cancer theranostics is the intravenous (i.v.) via, which poses major challenges in the development of new nanosystems. Once injected, NBMs will interact with a complex mixture of biomolecules naturally present in the bloodstream that can bind on their surface generating a biomolecular corona, which can confer a new biological identity to the NPs, inducing what is called the \"corona effect\". This is a major concern since the characteristics of the outermost molecular layer are always responsible for the interaction of such \"modified NBMs\", thus influencing the way they will interact with the biological system, such as the vessel walls, tissues, and organs. Accordingly, the formation of a biomolecular corona can completely change the biological parameters, such as the pharmacokinetics and fate of nanoparticles, now strongly influenced by the biomolecules that are adsorbed on the NPs surface (Corbo et al., 2015). Furthermore, the corona layer can interfere in the biological activity as illustrated by Salvati et al. The group demonstrated that transferrin-conjugated NPs, a glycoprotein known to target transferrin receptors overexpressed in some cancer cell subtypes, can lose the vectoring ability upon adsorption of biomolecules (Salvati et al., 2013). \n\nThe corona layer consists of two parts, the hard corona and the soft corona (Figure 3). The former one is comprised of molecules that are strongly bound to the NPs surface and have a slow exchange rate, while the latter one is constituted by more weakly and dynamically attached biomolecules (Corbo et al., 2015). Ashby et al. showed that the nature of the IO NPs coating layer influences the bonding/dissociation dynamic of the corona. A soft corona is preferentially formed when the hydrophobicity of the NPs surface is increased since proteins with faster exchange rates tend to be adsorbed (Ashby et al., 2014). Furthermore, the corona composition can change the cellular uptake mechanism as demonstrated by Francia et al. in vitro incubating nanoparticles with different amounts of human serum.",

There are multiple ways to target liver hepatocytes. A major mechanism proposed for targeting liver hepatocytes involves the formation of a protein corona enriched in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein involved in endogenous cholesterol transport (Fig. 3b). First, solvent-exposed PEG lipid desorbs from the LNP surface, unshielding the LNP for interactions with plasma proteins 98 . ApoE is among the subset of proteins that most abundantly adsorb to the LNP surface, and it can bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) 96 that is highly expressed by hepatocytes. LNPs enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, localizing to the endosome. As the endosome acidifies, ionizable lipids in the LNP are protonated, resulting in electrostatic interactions with negatively charged endosome lipids 27 and, eventually, disrupting the endosomal bilayer 143 . An LNP pK a of around 6.4 has been determined as optimal for endosomal escape, leading to cargo release into the hepatocyte cytosol to exert its therapeutic effect 159 . Knowing this mechanism has allowed researchers to improve the efficacy of LNP delivery to the liver 159 , highlighting the importance of mechanistically studying nanoparticle targeting.\n\nOther mechanisms for targeting hepatocytes that are ApoEindependent have also been developed. For example, incorporating 'synergistic' alkyne lipids into a cKK-E12 lipopeptide-based LNP promotes the binding of serum albumin to enhance mRNA delivery to the liver 160 , demonstrating that endogenous targeting of hepatocytes is possible using multiple proteins.\n\nInstead of altering the molecular composition of an LNP to yield a specific protein corona for hepatocyte delivery (endogenous targeting), conjugating ligands",

That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88].

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

            "text": "Introduction Nanoparticles (NPs), upon introduction to the biological systems, become wrapped by serum and cellular proteins constituting the protein corona (PC). This PC contributes largely to the NPs\u2019 interaction with the biological systems and their subsequent functions. On the one hand, PC can decrease the efficiency of targeting by directing the NPs to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or by masking the active targeting moieties and decreasing their ability to bind to their target receptors. On the other hand, some components of PC have offered hopes for achieving endogenous targeting. Methods In this study, we aimed at the investigation of the role of the PC in determining the behavior of cRGDyk peptide-unconjugated and -conjugated NPs (uNPs and cNPs) exhibiting different physicochemical properties and their interaction with melanoma on in vitro and in vivo levels. Mathematical modeling has been utilized to understand the kinetics of the interaction of NPs with the tumor cells and different organs, respectively. Results Endocytosis and exocytosis were reported to occur simultaneously for the utilized NPs. The balance was largely dependent on the NPs\u2019 physicochemical properties and the role of the PC. In addition, distinct proteins present in the PC (illustrated in the results of the PC analysis in part I) have also determined the patterns of the NPs\u2019 distribution in different organs and tissues of the vascular system, the RES system and the target tumot tissue. Vitronectin (VN) was found to mediate higher accumulation in integrin receptor-expressing melanoma cells, while complement 3 protein (C3) and clusterin (CLU), as an opsonin and dysopsonin, respectively, regulated the balance between the RES uptake and blood circulation. Discussion PC, if properly modulated by tuning NPs\u2019 physicochemical properties, can serve as a potential venue for optimum utilization of NPs in cancer therapy.",

The formation of a new biological identity of NPs interacting with cells and tissues in the living organism and their altered functions in the biological system leads to a decrease in the targeting efficiency because of the masking of the identity of the targeting ligand to the receptor of the cell membrane, or it may lead to the NPs being engulfed by the macrophagic system.

PC formations on the surface of the NPs modify the fate of nanomaterials regarding the biodistribution and circulation time in physiological fluid [65]. \n\nTekie and associates assumed that without significantly modulating the physicochemical characteristics of nanomaterials pertaining to bio-interference, the effective therapeutic efficacy of the intended objective would be inconceivable. The team studied the generation and biodistribution of various chitosan (Ch)-based nanoparticles including Ch and carboxymethyl dextran (CMD)/thiolated dextran (TD) polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) by applying the chromatography, mass spectroscopy, and CT scanning techniques. The changes in the surface adsorption of the serum protein in the culture medium after varying the pH and the consequent cell uptake were evaluated in vitro. It was shown that the developed PECs had a low concentration of PC normally enriched with apolipoproteins, trypsin, and haemoglobin. Moreover, the study reported the positive outcome of the PC layer on PECs which prompted biodistribution and a regressed uptake in the liver and achieved a desirable therapeutic effect. \n\nIn the biodistribution study, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scan images of three animal groups apparently showed that the concentration of NPs unbounded 68 Ga in the kidneys and bladder which had filtered in this organ.

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "Prior to analyzing the transfection efficiency and the nanovector anti-inflammatory properties, an important key issue for profiling their biological activity was the profiling of the protein adsorbed on the surface of hPECs when suspended in the cell culture medium. Nanoparticles in biological fluids immediately interact with proteins that rapidly bind to their surface, forming a so-called \"protein corona\" [34,35]. These proteins can confer a new biological identity, which can influence body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and, more importantly, toxicity and inflammation properties [36][37][38]. Before the isolation of the bound proteins by centrifugal steps, DLS analyses of the hPECs suspended in cell culture medium were performed in order to exclude the presence of aggregates. The resulting protein profiles obtained by SDS-PAGE indicated low adsorption of low-molecular-weight proteins by hPECs (Supplementary Figure S3). \n\nAccording to the Vroman effect [39], proteins with higher mobility and those more abundant in the serum are the first to interact with the NP surface with soft bonds. These are subsequently replaced by less mobile proteins with greater affinity for the nanoparticle surface that can last longer and are retained, even during endocytosis. This supports the hypothesis of a weak Vroman effect and possibly a weak protein interaction. Notably, both PRM-hPECs and PEI-hPECs produced the same protein corona profile when incubated in a cell culture medium. This indicated that the commonly shared chitosan-TPP outer layer imparted the identified affinity for the proteins present in the cell culture medium. This result was also supported by the analysis of protein coronas of empty hPECs in which the pDNA was substituted by the polyanion heparin during the synthesis procedures (Supplementary Figure S3B). In the same way, the protein profiles resemble those obtained for the DNAloaded nanoformulations. Hence, the only component responsible for the nanoparticle interactions with proteins is the chitosan-TPP added in the final step of synthesis.",

            "text": "By comparing NPs such as SWNTs, MWNTs, TiO 2 , ZnO, SiO 2 , and quartz sand, Sund et al 117 identified that adsorbed plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen, complement proteins, Igs, and apolipoproteins, did not vary, and they covered NPs irrespective of their surface properties. However, the binding efficiency of these NPs to cell lysate proteins varied based on surface characteristics. This is attributable to plasma proteins having glycosylated residues not commonly encountered among cytoplasmic proteins. The formation of protein coronas around NPs might also likely be due to alterations in their surface properties due to the pH of the surrounding environment. TiO 2 interacts with proteins more effectively at pH 6 compared to neutral and near-basic pH values.\n\nMost functional groups have a net charge and, even though they can independently contribute to the interaction dynamics with plasma proteins and macrophages, we will analyze them together in this section. Recent investigations using nanoshells have shown that positively charged particles have a higher rate of uptake by phagocytic cells in comparison to negatively charged and neutral particles. 133 In another study, negatively charged PEG-single-walled carbon nanohorns displayed lower macrophage uptake. 134 It is important to note that the density of the surface coating is equally important in determining cellular uptake. Different NPs can demonstrate highly discordant behavior when internalization is purely analyzed from a charge-based perspective. For example, recently, in vivo intravital real-time multiphoton microscopy of the liver revealed that positively charged mesoporous silica NPs was primarily taken up by hepatocytes, and negatively charged particles were taken up by phagocytic Kupffer cells ( Figure 5). 96 Likewise, a study using polystyrene NPs showed that negatively charged particles had a higher internalization rate into macrophages, and positively charged particles into monocytes. 135 Highly charged surfaces, in comparison to neutral particles, attract complement factors. However, Liu et al 136 demonstrated that complement factors are not activated in the presence of neutral and negatively charged particles. Patel et al, 110 on the other hand, demonstrated that positively charged particles became negatively charged in serum after the opsonization",

            "text": "Stability issues related to in vivo conditions may include chemical and colloidal stability. Cargoes can be exposed to enzymes like, for example, RNAses in the extracellular space [274]. The in vivo environment can affect stability by affecting the nanoparticle's aggregation propensity [275]. High ionic strength in biological fluids may affect the tendency of nanoparticles to aggregate [275,276]. For example, DNA/PEI complexes aggregated at physiological ion concentrations to large particles of up to approximately a micrometre in size [275,276]. Carriers may also form aggregates with cells in the blood stream [277]. Aggregate size may influence the endocytic uptake route taken [278], and if aggregate sizes are large enough, they embolize capillaries [8,279]. Shear forces and the adherence of serum proteins like albumin contributed to the dissociation of polymer micelles as observed from in vitro experiments and in blood vessels of mice [262,280]. \n\nNon-specific adsorption of biomolecules on nanoparticles from the environment can form a \"corona\" on the particle surface in vivo [90,156,275,281,282], and its composition depends on particle-size and particle-surface properties [283] as well as tissue-specific presence, adsorption or desorption of proteins in the environment of the particle [90,284]. The corona can influence tissue distribution, cellular delivery efficiency and circulation times of the drug [90,285,286]. As an example, if apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is adsorbed to carriers or if components of the carriers mimic ApoE, this influences the distribution of carriers by targeting to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and subsequent delivery to hepatocytes [90,286,287]. Plasma proteins that have been reported to interact with lipid-based carriers and to influence their in vivo performance include highly abundant proteins like albumin, which may cause destabilization of particles or proteins that promote clearance by the immune system like complement proteins or immunoglobulins [288].",

            "text": "A galectin 8 (Gal8) recruitment assay was used to evaluate the level of endosomal disruption by the LNPs. Gal8 is a cytoplasmic protein that can selectively bind with glycosylated moieties in the internal endosome membrane. [38] Cells stably expressing Gal8-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein have been widely used to evaluate endosomal escape. If the endosome is disrupted, the cytoplasmic Gal8-YFP can be recruited to damaged endosomes, forming discrete yellow fluorescent spots, [39] as depicted in Figure 2f. As shown in Figure 2g, LNPs with a higher DOTMA content resulted in fewer yellow fluorescent spots, while those with a higher proportion of ionizable lipid MC3 generated much more yellow spots in the treated cells (Figure 2h), suggesting that ionizable lipid MC3 in the LNPs can promote endosomal escape of the LNPs after endocytosis. According to the above results, we chose the LNP formulation prepared at 20:20:20 (simplified as LNP in later studies) as the lead LNP carrier in further studies. \n\nAnother key challenge for nanocarriers in protein delivery especially for in vivo applications is their serum stability. Nanoparticles such as LNPs were adsorbed with serum proteins, and the proteins abundant in the blood may trigger the release of cargo proteins and affect the endocytosis as well as intracellular trafficking of the nanoparticles. [40,41] Therefore, we investigated the influence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the delivery efficacy of prepared LNPs. As shown in Figure 3a, FBS addition greatly enhanced the GFP delivery efficacy of the LNPs on 143B cells. The presence of FBS did not result in the pre-release of encapsulted GFP in the LNPs (Figure 3b). We further examined how serum proteins facilitate GFP delivery into the cells. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a reversible apolipoprotein, is mainly associated with lipid trafficking.",

It has become clear that slight changes in the physicochemical properties of NPs have significant biological implications. Most NPs that come into contact with biological materials are coated by a wide variety of proteins, which is named the \"protein corona.\" One component of the NP corona (called opsonins) can enhance the NP uptake by the RES. Under physiologic conditions, the corona may alter the NP properties by masking its surface characteristics [9,10]. e exposure time in the blood circulation has been recognized as a key factor that shapes the NP biomolecular corona; furthermore, the new properties that are imparted to the NPs by the corona are the main factor that controls the distribution, nanotoxicity, and the therapeutic effect of NPs in the body [11] (Figure 2). Some studies have suggested that the formation of the protein corona is an undesirable process; however, others have discussed the advantages of this formation, such as reducing the cytotoxic effect, eliminating undesirable interactions with the immune system, and facilitating cellular internalization [12]. e protein corona might reduce the targeting capability of the NPs by shielding the recognition site of the targeting ligands from the receptors [13]. Different disease types can have different effects on the corona composition, because for every disease, there are different types of proteins secreted in the body, and these proteins may affect the corona composition around the NPs [14]. ese considerations mean that patients with different types of cancer may have specific types of coronas [14]. is has led some authors to introduce a new concept for NP targeting called a \"personalized protein corona\" (PPC) [15], wherein precise information on corona composition is a must to produce optimum personalized nanomedicines for therapy and diagnosis of every type of cancer. Colapicchioni et al. [16] investigated whether the pathological alteration of plasma proteins influenced the protein corona. ey incubated liposomes with the plasma taken from patients with confirmed breast, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. e NPs were then isolated by centrifugation, and they found that the hard corona varied",

Once in contact with a biological environment, nanosized objects immediately interact with the surrounding biomolecules, which can adsorb on the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona. 7,8 Some of the biomolecules in this layer associate with the nanoparticle surface almost irreversibly, affecting de facto the subsequent behavior. For instance, it has been shown that the formation of the corona can affect nanomaterial stability and biodistribution, macrophage sequestration, immune system activation, cellular recognition, and nanomaterial final fate. 9\u221211 In some cases, the formation of a biomolecular corona can also affect the specificity of targeted drugs, by masking targeting ligands attached to the nanocarrier. 12,13 Polymers such as poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are usually grafted on the nanoparticle surface to partially reduce protein binding and subsequent macrophage sequestration. 14\u221216 However, recent work suggested that the so-called stealth effect is actually conferred by specific corona proteins adsorbed on PEGylated surfaces. 17 At the same time, researchers are also trying to exploit the biomolecular corona as a targeting strategy to direct nanoparticles toward specific cellular routes. 18\u221220 So far, corona formation and its composition have been widely investigated. 21\u221224 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed",

            "text": "Purpose In the bloodstream, nanoparticles (NPs) interact with serum proteins to form the protein corona, which includes both opsonins, promoting NP recognition and elimination, and dysopsonins, which can inhibit opsonin activity. Albumin, the most abundant serum protein, is part of this corona and can act as a dysopsonin, potentially hiding NPs from the immune system. This study aims to investigate how a covalently bound layer of human serum albumin (HSA) on polymeric NPs affects the protein corona and their behavior in the immune system. Methods We covalently attached HSA to the surface of polymeric NPs to modify the protein corona composition. These HSA-covered nanostructures were then decorated with an anti-CD19 recombinant antibody fragment to target malignant B cells, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The safety profile and bioavailability of these targeted HSA-nanoparticles were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using a human-zebrafish xenograft model of ALL. The efficacy of the nanostructures in delivering encapsulated doxorubicin and suppressing tumor growth was also assessed. Results The HSA coating on polymeric NPs effectively modified the protein corona, preventing opsonization and subsequent macrophage-mediated elimination. The targeted HSA-nanoparticles maintained a safe profile with reduced macrophage interaction and specifically targeted tumor cells in the xenograft model. This resulted in the successful delivery of doxorubicin, tumor growth suppression, and increased survival of the model organisms. Conclusion The study demonstrates that HSA-coated nanoparticles can be used as a therapeutic nanoplatform with a safe profile and enhanced bioavailability. The ability to decorate these nanostructures with specific targeting agents, such as anti-CD19 antibodies, opens up the potential for developing versatile therapeutic platforms that can be tailored to target various clinical conditions.",

In this natural environment, NPs encounter various physiological challenges, such as interactions with blood components, immune responses, and tissue-specific barriers. Their interactions with biomolecules are significantly influencing NP-based applications because they can change their biological identity. \n\nDue to their high surface free energy, nanostructures interact with proteins upon introduction into biological fluids (BFs). These interactions, including electrostatic, Van der Waals, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, drive the adsorption of proteins onto the surface of NPs in the biological environment [52]. These protein layers were defined as the \"protein corona (PC)\" [53]. The PC can be categorized into different layers, encompassing the 'soft' and 'hard' corona, based on the binding affinity between the proteins and the NPs' surface [54]. The formation of PCs in biological fluids is a very dynamic process. Proteins with low affinity and reversible binding, such as serum albumin [55], may be replaced by proteins with low abundance but high affinity, such as immunoglobulins [56], apolipoprotein ApoA [57], and complement factors [58]. The phenomenon known as the \"Vroman effect\" involves a time-and concentration-dependent exchange to achieve dynamic equilibrium. The NP-protein complex eventually achieves a stable and irreversible minimum energy state as time progresses [55,59,60]. \n\nThroughout the adsorption process, proteins have the potential to experience conformational changes as they adjust to the surface of the nano-biosystem. This event possesses the capacity to induce modifications in the secondary/tertiary structures of proteins and their interactions with the surrounding media. The biological functions of proteins in BFs rely on their interactions with various biomolecules and substances. Therefore, even minor alterations in protein structure resulting from interactions with NPs can greatly affect their pharmacological activities and interactions with other proteins, resulting in varied biological responses [59]. \n\nThe existence of a responsive PC can significantly influence the uptake of NPs by cells and the activation of intracellular pathways [61].",

A portion of the serum proteins that bind and cap the nanoparticles are termed opsonins. Nanoparticles capped with these proteins can be recognized and captured by macrophages, contributing to the loss of the majority of the administrated dose because of retention by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). 50 t is important to mention that the protein corona can change over time to create different protein profiles. 51,52 odification of colloidal particles with polymers such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG) can increase their half-life in the blood 47 and also enhance the selective delivery of nanoparticles.

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

These protein layers strongly influence the interaction of NPs with cells, particularly drug uptake. Based on the binding affinity and the time required for the exchange of adsorbed proteins, protein coronas can be divided into a high relationship \"hard corona\" that directly interacts with the surfaces of nanomaterials, requiring a time of long exchange and low-affinity adsorption, which can achieve biomolecules' fast \"soft corona\" exchange [95]. The protein corona's presence dramatically alters the nanocarriers' surface properties and provides a novel biological property that affects their actual physical response in vivo. Based on this study, Meewan et al. showed that pegylated zein micelles could effectively reduce the uptake of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in plasma without affecting the uptake of micelles by melanoma. This may be due to the presence of anti-opsonins such as albumin and apolipoprotein in the hard caps of proteins surrounding the micelles, which antagonize the biological effects of micelle-bound opsonins [96]. \n\nEnediyne natural products are commonly used for treating liver cancer and leukemia in the form of copolymers or antibody-drug conjugates.

            "text": "One of the major challenges for targeted delivery of NPs is their cellular uptake by phagocytes [84]. In a biological environment, NPs can be surrounded by various types of biomolecules including proteins of the extracellular matrix, serum albumin, apo-lipoproteins, complement components and immunoglobulins which will form the corona. The receptors expressed on the phagocytic cell membranes attach to the proteins on the surface of NPs and internalize them [84,85]. Even if the phagocytes do not uptake NPs, the corona layer covers the ligands, and the NPs are not recognized by the targeted cells, and lose their specificity [86]. One of the most common and efficient solutions for this problem is coating NPs with a barrier-like layer composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), called PEGylation. PEG chains on the surface of NPs create steric hindrance, which inhibits the protein adsorption and decreases recognition by macrophages [87]. \n\nOne of main goals in targeted delivery is to internalize NPs into specific cells by an endocytosis pathway such as clathrin, caveolin, etc. Studies on targeted drug delivery have shown that NPs lose their specificity when coated with corona. Corona not only changes the surface composition and structure of NPs, which directly influences the cell-NP interactions, but also affects the geometry and size of NPs, which play a crucial role in cellular uptake [88].",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

            "text": "Since siRNA specifically inhibits the target protein functions via the specific cleaving of the target mRNA, it has been receiving significant attention as an anti-cancer agent. To date, there have been several successful and unique reports for treating tumors using LNPs. Before the development of LNPs (siRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles), siRNA was delivered to the target organs via systemic administration by attaching siRNA onto the particle (liposome) surface (lipoplex) [118,119]. Since the accumulation of lipoplex in a tumor relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [120,121], the surface of the lipoplex can be modified with a hydrophilic PEG polymer to increase its circulation time after intravenous injection; otherwise, the lipoplex is rapidly captured by the reticuloendothelial system. On the other hand, it was reported that LNPs without a large amount of PEG modification are highly effective for liver targeting [28,122,123]. LNPs prepared with ionizable lipids form a protein corona in the bloodstream [124]. ApoE in the protein corona is recognized by receptors such as LDLR, which are overexpressed by hepatocytes [125]. Then, the complexes are internalized into hepatocytes via the ApoE-LDLR pathway [28,122,123]. Since the formation of the protein corona in the bloodstream is important for the liver targeting of LNPs, only a small amount of PEG modification (~1% as a molar ratio) of the LNP is standard protocol in the case of liver targeting. This means that the PEG modification for liver targeting is not for obtaining long circulation of LNPs after systemic administration but for increasing their stability in the bloodstream, such as by inhibition of aggregation.\n\nIn general, ionizable lipids in LNPs are positively charged at lower pH (pH~6.0); therefore, highly hydrophobic LNPs tend to aggregate at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A small amount of PEG modification increases LNP stability in the bloodstream and may not inhibit ApoE binding in the bloodstream. For example, Huang et al. prepared polymerlipid hybrid",

            "text": "Summary When particles incorporated within a mammalian organism come into contact with body fluids they will bind to soluble proteins or those within cellular membranes forming what is called a protein corona. This binding process is very complex and highly dynamic due to the plethora of proteins with different affinities and fractions in different body fluids and the large variation of compounds and structures of the particle surface. Interestingly, in the case of nanoparticles (NP) this protein corona is well suited to provide a guiding vehicle of translocation within body fluids and across membranes. This NP translocation may subsequently lead to accumulation in various organs and tissues and their respective cell types that are not expected to accumulate such tiny foreign bodies. Because of this unprecedented NP accumulation, potentially adverse biological responses in tissues and cells cannot be neglected a priori but require thorough investigations. Therefore, we studied the interactions and protein binding kinetics of blood serum proteins with a number of engineered NP as a function of their physicochemical properties. Here we show by in vitro incubation tests that the binding capacity of different engineered NP (polystyrene, elemental carbon) for selected serum proteins depends strongly on the NP size and the properties of engineered surface modifications. In the following attempt, we studied systematically the effect of the size (5, 15, 80 nm) of gold spheres (AuNP), surface-modified with the same ionic ligand; as well as 5 nm AuNP with five different surface modifications on the binding to serum proteins by using proteomics analyses. We found that the binding of numerous serum proteins depended strongly on the physicochemical properties of the AuNP. These in vitro results helped us substantially in the interpretation of our numerous in vivo biokinetics studies performed in rodents using the same NP. These had shown that not only the physicochemical properties determined the AuNP translocation from the organ of intake towards blood circulation and subsequent accumulation in secondary organs and tissues but also the the transport across organ membranes depended on the route of AuNP application. Our in vitro protein binding studies support the notion that the observed differences in in vivo biokinetics are mediated by the NP protein corona and its dynamical change during AuNP translocation in fluids and across membranes within the organism.",

            "text": "Therefore, understanding the in vivo properties and biodistribution of both drugs and nanocarriers is critical to facilitate the development of nanoparticle-loaded DMNs. \n\nAmong all drug modalities, small molecules are usually low-molecular-weight compounds with a defined chemical structure [89]. They exhibit specificity depending on the chemical structures and the targets they interact with in vivo. When small molecules are absorbed in the blood, they are distributed through the body's circulation to various organs and tissues, where they interact with cellular components. Small molecules tend to have a shorter half-life and are easily metabolized by the body, thus limiting their duration in the body [90]. To explore their in vivo fate, Li et al. developed clearing-assisted tissue click chemistry (CATCH) to optically image covalent drug targets in intact mammalian tissues. This study provided a valuable platform for visualizing the in vivo interactions of Regarding nanocarriers, a thorough investigation into the myriad factors influencing in vivo fates is imperative. It has been reported that the protein corona is an important factor affecting the interaction between nanoparticles and organisms and the in vivo delivery process. The nature of nanoparticles themselves and the environment of the organism can regulate the in vivo delivery process of nanoparticles by influencing the composition of protein coronas [97]. Therefore, paying attention to protein coronas in the in vivo fate studies is necessary. In addition, the size of the nanoparticles was found to determine their elimination and targeting. Du et al. provided a systematic summary of the size-scale laws governing the transport of nanoparticles in the human body and how size-dependent transport can be used to address the main challenges in translational nanomedicine [98]. Furthermore, the shape, hardness [99], surface charge, and surface hydrophilicity of nanoparticles could influence their clearance and translocation [100], which are also worth investigating.",

            "text": "However, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells. For example, coronas with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have increased access to the brain [24]. Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE [29]. In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain [14]. Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs [14]. \n\nIn recent in vitro studies, the critical role of serum concentration as a primary modulator of toxicity to NPs has been documented. High serum protein concentrations allow for protein attachment to hard coronas, which shields cells from immediate damage after engulfment of NPs [30,31]. In vivo serum concentrations are 10 to 50-fold higher than those used in cell culture (2%-10%, approximately 4 mg/mL) [30]. Thus, NP targeting of cells in culture is not necessarily reproducible in vivo [32]. In one example, the cytotoxic effects of NPs on A549 (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial) cells decreased with increasing concentrations of serum, from 4 to 40 mg/mL. Cytoxicity was evaluated based on cell death and decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels. The highest concentrations of serum fully protected A549 cells from NP toxicity [32]. The same investigators in related studies with lower concentrations of serum determined that NPs induce damage in a variety of different cell types via apparently similar mechanisms [30][31][32][33]. Endocytosis of NPs leads to degradation of the hard corona and exposure of NP-ligand surfaces in the lysosome.",

            "text": "The liposomes used here, have a more negative zeta potential compared to the EVs. This could rise the question, if the difference in protein corona observed between liposomes and EVs is due to the difference in zeta potential. However, the protein corona of the two differently charged liposomes was almost identical. Therefore, we conclude that the zeta potential of the liposomes plays a minor role for their protein corona composition and the difference in protein corona composition between EVs and liposomes is not mainly caused by the difference in zeta potential. \n\nAs observed for liposomes before, the EVs used in this study showed an enhanced uptake in phagocytic cell types after protein corona adsorption. We therefore investigated if the high amount of immunoglobulins representing known opsonins would explain the higher uptake. In the 33% DOPE liposome protein corona, we also found immunoglobulins but fewer complement proteins. Instead, apolipoproteins and serum albumin were enriched, which are known as dysopsonins. However, the dysopsonizing proteins could not ameliorate the opsonizing effect of immunoglobulins. Overall, the protein coronas of 33% DOPE liposomes and EVs had opsonizing properties as cell uptake into phagocytes was increased upon protein corona adsorption. \n\nComparing our results to Mateos-Maroto et al., also stresses the importance of investigating human plasma-derived protein coronas for targeting of human cell lines when developing drug delivery vehicles (Mateos-Maroto et al., 2023). In contrast to our results, they found that an FBS-derived protein corona decreased the uptake of liposomes in murine macrophage cells. For liposomes, it has been known for decades that rapid blood-clearance is a major problem for clinical applicability and surface modifications are used to prolong blood circulation times (Shen et al., 2018). This is in good accordance with our finding, that the protein corona on non-functionalized liposomes enhances uptake in monocytes. Furthermore, this raises the question if EVs would also need stealth modifications to reach their full delivery potential.",

            "text": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "LNP typically consists of four components, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper phospholipid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids [86].\n\nThese four components can form stable nanoparticles to encapsulate and protect vulnerable mRNA. Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNP technologies can achieve targeted delivery by adjusting the stoichiometry of LNP components, which was exemplified by the success in lymph node-targeting delivery of mRNA in mice [92].\n\nOther strategies, like additional non-lipid components in LNP formulation, also contribute to the",

            "text": "In the field of biomedical applications, nanocarriers (NC) have gained increasing interest based on their capacity to codeliver different drugs and biologicals in a targeting manner to distinct cell types [1]. Targeted delivery may reduce the overall amount of payload required for therapeutic applications as well as adverse effects caused by effects of drugs on non-target cells. However, NC most often accumulate serum factors on their surface, termed protein corona [2]. On one hand, the protein corona may shield targeting moieties and thereby attenuate intended target cell binding. On the other hand, NCadsorbed serum factors may engage receptors expressed by non-target cells resulting in unwanted uptake. In this regard, Zhang and coworkers first identified constituents of the protein corona of gold nanoparticles [3]. Then, these NC were incubated with serum deficient of single constituents to elucidate their individual role for the overall composition of the protein corona and corona-dependent NC binding to macrophages. By this approach, antithrombin III, fibronectin and other factors of the protein corona were shown to bind IgG. This, in turn, resulted in elevated binding of the antibody-opsonized NC to Fc receptors on macrophages. The cellular interaction of NC may also be affected in case NC surface properties affect the conformational state of adsorbed proteins. For example, Mortimer and coworkers demonstrated that albumin that adsorbed onto silicate-based NC altered its conformation, which resulted in its recognition by class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) on macrophages. To limit the unwanted binding of NC, especially to myeloid cells, NC have been decorated with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and dysopsonic proteins, which serve to minimize the formation of a protein corona [2,4] [5,6]. Moreover, We [7] and others [8] have demonstrated that solid core NC coated with the carbohydrate dextran (DEX) to ensure biocompatibility may trigger the carbohydrate complement pathway in vivo resulting in the deposition of active complement C3 fragments.",

            "text": "Adsorption of protein on the surface of ENPs and formation of PC-ENP complex in vivo seem inevitable. Thus, we can obtain specific biofunctionalized PC-ENP complex with unique advantages in biomedical applications. At present, the study of PC has gradually evolved from identification to application. There have been applied researches in the field of biomedicine such as drug carriers, targeting and personalized therapy based on PC.\n\nEngineered nanoparticles used for targeted delivery of cancer drugs in vivo have been extensively investigated (Chou et al., 2011;Yu et al., 2012). There are two main targeting strategies for ENPs' delivery to tumor: passive targeting and active targeting. However, most investigations remain at the laboratory stage. One possible reason is that PC rapidly formed on the surface of the carrier, thereby impeding their targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Su et al., 2016Su et al., , 2018. For passive targeting, ENPs target tumors by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, proteins such as immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and complement can facilitate the clearance of ENPs by MPS. Thus, decrease of the adsorption of these types of protein on EPS can be used to enhance their passive targeting. For example, Takeuchi et al. (2017) prepared molecularly imprinted nanogels (MIP-NGs) with the capability of albumin recognition, which allows the particles to be immediately cloaked by albumin corona after injection, and thus reduces phagocytosis. As a result, most of MIP-NGs accumulated in tumor tissue, and almost no retention in liver tissue. Besides, PEG-conjugated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) adsorbed apolipoproteins in blood and successfully delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) to LDLR-expressed HepG2 tumors and, with the accumulation ratio of tumor to all organs up by about 30% . Tesarova et al. (2020) found that PAS [proline (P), alanine (A), and serine (S)] modified ferritin (FRT)-based nanocarriers (PAS-10-FRTElli) reduced PC formation and did not",

Hence, NP shape, size, surface charge, elemental composition and hydrophilicity will steer each NP to one endocytic process or the other [128]. There are, however, few easily predicted and consistent rules about cellular uptake of metal oxide NPs.\n\nParticles between 10-50 nm exhibit the highest rates of entry in many cell types whereas large particles (~100 nm) and very small particles (1-2 nm) are taken up less avidly. The reduction in uptake of very large particles is attributed to agglomeration into amorphous particles that are too large to access classical endocytic pathways. Very small particles are also assimilated into cells less effectively than larger particles, although the reasons for this reduced accumulation are not known. Smaller metal oxides nanoparticles (<10 nm) tend to enter and exit the cell more rapidly than larger NPs [88], and the concentration of smaller NPs may be less at any instant even though the entry and exit of small NPs are more rapid. In nanogold particles, the protein corona significantly decreases cellular uptake efficiency in a size-dependent manner in in vitro studies. The accumulation of larger particles (~50 nm) was reduced by the presence of a protein corona whereas, the uptake of small particles (5 nm) was unaffected by their interactions with proteins [129]. The majority of blood proteins, albumin, immunoglobins, ApoE, etc. are large (100s of kD, 1000s of amino acid residues), so it is likely that smaller nanoparticles decorate these larger proteins and tissue targeting is dependent on the protein. It is possible that nanoparticles may change from cargo to carrier, and in the transition, the targeting and activity of the protein may be dictated by the NP, especially once the NP enters the intracellular space where intracellular proteins in eukaryotic systems tend to be small (196 to 1157 amino acids) [130]. The biological impact of the corona on cellular accumulation is further complicated in that the nature or amount of protein associated with the material, and any change",

Approximately 300 proteins were detected for each sample, and around 100 of them were present in all coronas (Figure 1d). Figure 1c shows the distribution of protein classes in the different coronas and in human plasma. As also observed in other studies, 5,6,29,42 corona formation led to the enrichment of different low abundant proteins on the nanoparticle surface, which was particularly high for apolipoproteins and coagulation factors and lower for complement factors and tissue leakage proteins. Figure 1e shows the list of the 20 most abundant proteins in each corona, which represented 40\u221260% of the total proteins recovered, together with their relative protein abundance, RPA (see the Materials and Methods section for details). As previously observed, 5,6,29,42 several proteins were highly enriched in the different corona in comparison to their abundance in plasma. For instance, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), which in plasma had an RPA of only 0.01% (see full results for plasma in the Supporting Information), was highly enriched in the corona formed on all different particles types, where alone it constituted roughly 8 to 18% of all corona proteins. This was further confirmed by Western blot of HRG, which showed a strong band at around 75 kDa (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which was also clearly visible in the SDS-PAGE gel image (Figure 1a and 1b). Additionally, as already visible by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1a,b), the relative amount of the different corona proteins differed for the nanoparticles with different surface functionalization, as well as for the different nanoparticle sizes. 23,25,38 Some unique proteins present in only some of the coronas were also identified.

This corona can influence cellular uptake, biodistribution, and immune responses, thereby modulating the overall behavior and functionality of the nanomaterials in biological environments. Mo et al. showed that the size of BP can influence the identity and quantity of plasma proteins that form the corona, and in return, the corona could define the shape of ultra-small 2D NMs-corona complexes but does not change the shape of large 2D NMs [97]. Owing to the enrichment of immune proteins and other opsonins on the surface of BP nanomaterials, the uptake efficiency of BP-corona complexes by macrophages is higher, and the size-dependent cellular uptake pattern of BP-corona complexes is different from that of native nanomaterials. \n\nMitigating the influence of protein coronas on nanomaterials involves employing various strategies aimed at reducing or altering the protein-nanomaterial interactions. Surface modification and functionalization techniques serve as effective approaches to minimize protein adsorption onto nanomaterials. Introducing specific coatings or bio-compatible molecules, such as PEG or serum albumin, can deter protein binding, thus diminishing the formation of protein coronas. Precise control over nanomaterial properties, including size, shape, surface chemistry, and charge, offers another avenue to mitigate protein corona formation. Selecting or optimizing nanomaterial structures that exhibit reduced protein adsorption in biological environments helps alleviate the adverse effects of protein coronas on nanomaterial functionality. Understanding the interplay between two-dimensional nanomaterials and protein structures, as well as the impact of protein coronas, is crucial for designing tailored nanomaterials with desired functionalities for various biomedical applications. This comprehension facilitates the development of nanomaterials with enhanced biocompatibility, improved targeting efficiency, and minimized adverse effects, contributing to their utility in drug delivery, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.

            "text": "The lifetime of the hard corona has been shown to be several hours and it can define the NP surface properties. Since the biomolecules compete for the limited surface on NPs, at first NPs will be covered by more abundant small molecules, and subsequently replaced by the larger and high affinity molecules over time, to form the hard corona [80,81]. Lipoproteins are formed when lipids bind to the apo-lipoproteins to facilitate their transportation. NPs can bind to the lipoproteins as a corona structure [82]. Recent investigations have shown that the NPs not only bind to the apo-lipoproteins but also interact with the lipoprotein [83]. \n\nOne of the major challenges for targeted delivery of NPs is their cellular uptake by phagocytes [84]. In a biological environment, NPs can be surrounded by various types of biomolecules including proteins of the extracellular matrix, serum albumin, apo-lipoproteins, complement components and immunoglobulins which will form the corona. The receptors expressed on the phagocytic cell membranes attach to the proteins on the surface of NPs and internalize them [84,85]. Even if the phagocytes do not uptake NPs, the corona layer covers the ligands, and the NPs are not recognized by the targeted cells, and lose their specificity [86]. One of the most common and efficient solutions for this problem is coating NPs with a barrier-like layer composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), called PEGylation. PEG chains on the surface of NPs create steric hindrance, which inhibits the protein adsorption and decreases recognition by macrophages [87]. \n\nOne of main goals in targeted delivery is to internalize NPs into specific cells by an endocytosis pathway such as clathrin, caveolin, etc. Studies on targeted drug delivery have shown that NPs lose their specificity when coated with corona. Corona not only changes the surface composition and structure of NPs, which directly influences the cell-NP interactions, but also affects the geometry and size of NPs, which play a crucial role in cellular uptake [88].",

Immediately after injection into the bloodstream, the NP encounters a vast spectrum of serum proteins, blood cells, the immune system, and other cellular components all having the potential to influence NP PK and BD, as well as initiate NP-mediated side effects. 8,9 \u221211 Additionally, NP with different physical characteristics are known to have different organ deposition and clearance pathways. 12,13 Information about clearance and biodistribution can guide both the targeting of specific organs for therapy or imaging and the monitoring of organ specific toxicity. Once within the organs, they have the potential to induce toxic effects if they are not cleared effectively, as seen with carbon nanotubes 14 and quantum dots. 15,16 Knowing the types of physical and chemical characteristics that lead to predictable toxicities and biodistribution patterns will inform the use of NP vehicles for drug delivery or imaging applications. \n\nThe protein corona bound to NP is emerging as a major determinant of their in vivo fate. 17 Protein deposition onto NP occurs immediately upon exposure to serum with the corona composition remaining relatively stable over time. 18,19 The protein mixtures within these coronas has the potential to influence their PK, BD, and clearance rate. 20 \u221222 Knowledge of the factors influencing NP protein corona deposition will go a long way toward explaining or predicting their in vivo performance. \n\nPolyrotaxanes (PR) are a unique class of rod-shaped nanomaterials derived from a noncovalent macrocycle threading process onto an included polymeric core. Bulky blocking groups prevent macrocycle dethreading until PR end-cap cleavage from the polymer termini. 23",

            "text": "Each delivery route has its limitations associated with certain biological barriers. These barriers prevent the successful accumulation of the drug-loaded carriers at the diseased sites, limiting their bioavailability and therapeutic potential. \n\nThe systemically delivered therapeutics encounter serial biological barriers including intravascular barriers, endothelial barriers, extracellular barriers, and cellular barriers (Figure 2) [16]. By this means, the administered drug-carrying platforms face such obstacles as (i) opsonization followed with subsequent sequestration by mononuclear phagocyte system, (ii) hemorheological/blood vessel flow limitations, (iii) pressure gradients, and (iv) cellular internalization including endosomal compartmentalization [73]. The major limitation of nanotherapeutic delivery is associated with nonspecific uptake in healthy organs. The injected carriers undergo opsonization and subsequent uptake by resident macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system, resulting in a high accumulation of this formulation in the spleen and the liver [74]. The opsonization of carriers involves the coating of their surface by such plasma proteins as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, and immunoglobulins [75]. The surface charge of the carriers plays an important role in protein adsorption, which in turn affects their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. It was demonstrated that highly cationic as well as highly anionic nanoparticles are rapidly cleared from circulation [76]. Meanwhile, neutral ones, as well as those with a slight charge, show significantly prolonged circulating half-lives [77]. \n\nRapid corona formation is found to affect hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, nanoparticle uptake, and endothelial cell death at an early exposure time [75]. The nature of the proteins in the corona is determined by the local chemical property of the nanomaterial. However, even for the particles of identical materials, both size and surface properties were found to play a very significant role in determining the biologically active proteins in the nanoparticle coronas, affecting the biological impacts [78]. These parameters critically determine the protein binding quantitatively but not qualitatively [75,79].",

Mechanisms of corona formation remain poorly understood; however, numerous studies have characterized and identi ed corona proteins from patient samples [39] . Manipulation and utilization of coronas has potential therapeutic bene ts in terms of drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment, and research in progress is focused on prolonging blood circulation time and enhancing targeting e ciency of NPs [11] . \n\nCoronas of BMPs have not been analyzed until last year [37] . We developed and describe here a simple alternative design strategy for directed formation of NP protein corona. Protein scaffolds on BMP surface favor recruitment of desired proteins (IgG, in this case) in plasma during corona formation. Full human or humanized Abs (TZ, in this case) can be incorporated (by pre-adsorption) into corona as targeting ligands. Spatial orientation of these Abs can be controlled to enhance their interaction capability with target molecules, and uptake by target cells. Our ndings indicate that most pre-adsorbed host molecules on protein scaffolds are retained in the corona and maintain their desired functions. In this new design strategy, corona formation is not viewed as a passive obstruction to NP delivery, but rather as a contributor to \"NP identity\"; i.e., NP targeting capacity is mediated by speci c components (IgG, in this case) in the corona.",

When nanocarriers come into contact with serum, proteins immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a protein corona which defines their biological identity. Although the composition of the protein corona has been widely determined by proteomics, its morphology still remains unclear. In this study we show for the first time the morphology of the protein corona using transmission electron microscopy. We are able to demonstrate that the protein corona is not, as commonly supposed, a dense, layered shell coating the nanoparticle, but an undefined, loose network of proteins. Additionally, we are now able to visualize and discriminate between the soft and hard corona using centrifugation-based separation techniques together with proteomic characterization. The protein composition of the \u223c15 nm hard corona strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the respective nanomaterial, thus further affecting cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Large diameter protein corona resulting from pre-incubation with soft corona or Apo-A1 inhibits cellular uptake, confirming the stealth-effect mechanism. In summary, the knowledge on protein corona formation, composition and morphology is essential to design therapeutic effective nanoparticle systems.",

Albumin was successfully adsorbed on the surface of SWCNTs. This bio-corona played a crucial role in cellular uptake in RAW264.7 macrophages. Damaged albumin interacts with scavenger receptors and clears from the systemic circulation (Dutta et al., 2007). The interaction of four major serum proteins (bovine serum albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin, and bovine fibrinogen) with SWCNTs was analysed (Ge et al., 2011). Prepared serum protein-coated SWCNTs produced less cytotoxicity than the uncoated SWCNTs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and leukemia cells. Cell line study also demonstrated that serum binding on SWCNTs altered the cellular interaction pathways. A competitive binding was established between them with different adsorption capacities. The \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the SWCNTs and aromatic residue was observed. This interaction plays a crucial role in tissue binding. It was observed that serum proteins responsible for the Toll-like receptor-dependent signaling in macrophages. GO showed a higher loading capacity for protein. Cytotoxicity of GO was altered in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, GO showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity at the lower concentration FBS due to the physical damage of the cell membrane. It was also suggested to coat GO with BSA for reducing the cytotoxicity towards A549 cell lines (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). Bio-corona is also observed in other body compartments like the lung, gastrointestinal tract, etc. The formation of different types of bio-corona may depend upon the environment. In a mice model, lung surfactant protein and lipid were absorbed by the pharyngeal aspiration of SWCNTs (Kapralov et al., 2012). Remarkably, phosphatidyl",

All identified proteins could be correlated to eight protein groups and the respective values were plotted as the percentage based on all identified proteins (Figure 4A). In comparison to the composition of the mouse plasma control, the percentage of serum albumin within the protein corona of the pristine nanocarriers (mgHES) increased significantly while the frequency of proteins of all other groups slightly decreased. A similar finding could be observed for all PEGylated samples irrespective of the PEG linker length used, even though the elevation in serum albumin content was not as pronounced as for the pristine nanocarriers. Qualitative analysis using SDS-PAGE further revealed serum albumin to be the strongest band with a molecular weight of about 62 kDa as detected by silver staining (Figure S5A). \n\nAdditionally, the top seven most abundant corona proteins detected in each group were plotted as a heatmap (Figure 4B).

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

            "text": "All PSNPs were incubated in DMEM + at 37 \u00b0C for 10 and 30 min. The protein corona was then collected and analysed using SDS-PAGE. The gel was loaded with the same amount of protein for all tested PSNPs. The gels did not show large differences between the different PSNPs nor between the 10 and 30 min incubation time (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Furthermore, the protein corona was quantified and characterized using label-free nano-LC/ MS-MS, which resulted in approximately 172 different adsorbed proteins. The complete list of identified proteins is provided in Additional file 2: Table S1. Proteins were clustered into 6 classes according to their biological function (and 1 \"other\" group). Comparing the relative amount (i.e. abundance) of a protein class on each nanoparticle to the protein class distribution as present in the cell culture medium, we observed an enrichment of proteins involved in binding, apolipoproteins, and acute phase proteins and a less pronounced enrichment of coagulation and complement factors (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, the total number of protein molecules per particle was calculated. On a single 50 nm PSNP around 2200-4000 protein molecules were absorbed (with the number of proteins on the different types of 50 nm PSNPs not being significantly different), while on the 200 nm PSNP about 59,000 proteins were absorbed (Fig. 5b). The number of proteins per surface area is between 3 \u00d7 10 13 and 5 \u00d7 10 13 proteins per cm 2 for the 50 nm while it is about 6 \u00d7 10 13 proteins per cm 2 for the 200 nm PSNPs. Comparable or slightly more proteins are absorbed per cm 2 on the 200 nm sized PSNP compared to the 50 nm PSNPs, an observation that might be explained by less steric hindrance on the larger particles. Among the top 20 most abundant proteins in the coronas of the 4 PSNPs, the protein Alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) ranked highest (Fig. 5c).",

            "text": "However, a distinction between the protein corona composition of the GNPs and the lysate of the PAD was noticed. This difference confirms that the protein corona of the GNPs wa ciently isolated from the cell lysate. After the analysis of the SDS-PAGE, the protein corona was additionally analyzed via LC-MS. A bottom-up proteomic approach was used for this protein analysis [43]. Therefore, proteins were desorbed from nanoparticles followed by digestion into peptides with trypsin. Peptides were separated by liquid chromatography and ionized by electrospray ionization. In the mass spectrometer, the mass-to-charge ratio of the ionized peptides was recorded. With the use of a deconvolution software and protein databases, these signals can be assigned to specific proteins, and through this, the composition of protein mixtures can be determined [43]. Here, we used this proteomic approach to analyze the intracellular fate of the GNPs. First, we considered the TOP 10 proteins in the protein corona for all conditions. Thereby, it can be seen that the TOP proteins binding on the GNPs after 4 h differ from the proteins binding after 24 h and 4 + 20 h. After 4 h incubation, serum proteins, namely fibrinogen and serum albumin, were predominantly measured. After more prolonged incubation, this protein adsorption pattern changed towards intracellular proteins e.g., histones and actin. \n\nNext, we analyzed to which intracellular compartments the proteins in the protein corona belong. Therefore, the enrichment factor of the proteins in the protein corona compared with cell lysate was calculated. Only proteins with a 1.5-fold enrichment were considered for annotation to an intracellular compartment. First, we used DAVID to assign the number of the enriched proteins of each condition to the different cellular compartments (Figure 4A). We observed that most of the enriched proteins of all conditions are associated with extracellular vesicles. The highest protein count for extracellular vesicle proteins can be seen in the 4 + 20 h condition and the least protein count in the 4 h condition.",

There was a moderate correlation between individual corona ApoE 366 and cellular eGFP expression and, according to our data, both corona and plasma AopE were not the optimal indicators for hepatic mRNA expression following LNP delivery (Fig 5b and 5c). In 368 contrast, the correlation between individual ApoM and cellular eGFP expression was much 369 stronger. The corona ApoM also correlated more with LNP function than plasma ApoM (Fig 5b  370 and 5c). In addition, other major HDL-associated apolipoproteins, such as ApoA-II, were also 371 highly correlated with cellular eGFP expression (Supplementary Fig. 16).

While our 375 analysis revealed that certain lipoproteins correlated more with increased LNP efficacy, it is 376 challenging to map this proteomic fingerprint onto a naturally occurring lipoprotein particle 377 population, although our data suggested that HDL particles were a likely source of the efficacious 378 corona components. 379\n\nTo explore LNP interactions with lipoprotein particles experimentally, Huh7 hepatocytes were 380 exposed to LNPs together with 1% lean plasma spiked with purified HDL, VLDL, and CM to 381 determine how these components affected cellular mRNA expression (recall that LNPs 382 supplemented with 1% lean plasma are not very functional in Fig. 1).

However, siRNA delivery efficiency can be influenced by the association of serum molecules with siRNA delivery systems, which alters their physiochemical properties. Serum molecules, such as immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and other serum proteins, adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles via nonspecific attractive forces. 11 It is possible that adsorption of serum proteins alters the surface properties of siRNA nanoparticles, thus inhibiting their uptake into cells. Hydrophilic polymers and nonionic surfactants are commonly used to modify the surface of nanoparticles and prevent nonspecific adsorption of serum proteins. 11,12 Several studies have shown that conjugation of PEG on the surface of nanoparticles has improved their blood circulation halflives. 11,12 Recently, it has been reported that coupling albumin onto the surface of pegylated liposomes reduces association of serum proteins. 13,14 n this study, we have investigated the effect of albumin on the cellular uptake of targeted EHCO/siRNA nanoparticles in the presence of serum. 6][17][18][19] Furthermore, albumin preferentially accumulates in tumor and inflamed tissues. 15 Thus, we have hypothesized and investigated that the incorporation of bovine serum albumin into targeted EHCO/siRNA nanoparticles enhances their cellular uptake in the presence of serum, and hence improves the gene-silencing efficiency of the siRNA/EHCO nanoparticles.",

            "text": "The lungs are at the centre of the respiratory system and enable gas exchange between air in the respiratory tract and blood in the circulation. The two major functional regions of the lung are the bronchi and the alveoli. External air travels from the bronchi to the alveoli, which are sac-like structures with high surface area enshrouded in a capillary network so as to promote efficient transfer of oxygen to the blood. The entirety of the cardiac output must pass through the lungs to oxygenate red blood cells, rendering the lungs readily accessible for intravenously administered nanoparticles 82 . Some diseases that interfere with proper lung function that are amenable to targeting with genetic drugs are cystic fibrosis, \u03b11 anti-trypsin deficiency and lung cancer.\n\nRe-targeting LNPs from the liver to the lungs has been achieved through the incorporation of atypical chemical motifs that alter protein corona composition. Notably, doping LNPs with a lipid containing a quaternary ammonium headgroup, a component termed a selective organ targeting (SORT) molecule, enables the lung-selective delivery of either mRNA or Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) ribonucleoproteins for gene editing in endothelial, epithelial and immune cells 45,173,174 . In the case of Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins, the positively charged quaternary ammonium lipids permit their formulation in a neutral buffer, which preserves their function and integrity. LNPs loaded with Cas9 were used to generate complex murine lung cancer models through multiplexed gene editing 174 . The lung-selective delivery of LNPs that contain quaternary ammonium lipids occurs by endogenous targeting, wherein desorption of PEG lipid from the LNP surface enables the binding of distinct proteins, such as vitronectin, at the expense of ApoE and other proteins implicated in liver targeting 97 . These large-scale changes in the functional composition of the protein corona are driven by the chemical structure of the SORT molecule and the ionization behaviour of the LNP 97 . The distinct protein corona composition promotes interactions with specific cellular receptors highly expressed within the lungs, such as receptor \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin by vitronectin, to yield tissue-specific",

            "text": "The protein corona is another key factor to be considered when developing any nanomaterial with biomedical applications. The protein corona is formed whenever a nanomaterial is introduced into a complex protein aqueous system and consists in the rapid adsorption of the most abundant proteins onto the surface of the nanomaterial, followed by the exchange of at least part of these proteins for others with higher affinity for the nanomaterial. The result is a nanoparticle with a completely different surface coating than that predicted in the design phase, sometimes with tendency for aggregation or with higher stability, with different internalization rates (enhanced or impaired), and different pharmacokinetics (68,69). \n\nThe composition of the protein corona is not universal, as it depends on the nanomaterial and on the previous coating. It was demonstrated, for instance, that citrate-coated IONPs were not stable while in contact with fetal calf serum proteins but were efficiently internalized by lymphoblastoid cells, while poly(acrylic acid)-coated IONPs were quite stable, although were poorly taken up, which can be a barrier to be faced by the nanomaterials inside the blood (68). \n\nAnother barrier that the nanoparticles must overcome is the reticuloendothelial system (RES), responsible for a rapid clearance of the nanomaterials once they enter in the bloodstream, decreasing their pharmacological action. Strategies to avoid the clearance by RES include surface modification with molecules that prevent opsonization and increase the half-life in blood, such as PEG. However, as described previously, many variables must be added, such as surface charge. Harush-Frenkel and collaborators verified once more the preferential internalization of positively charged nanoparticles (twice the endocytosis of their negatively charged counterparts) in HeLa cells, and after 45 min, the cells tend to decrease the uptake rate, characterizing a saturation phase (70). \n\nAnother factor that contributes to the decreased circulating time of nanoparticles in blood is the mononuclear phagocytic system, in which the macrophages quickly scavenge nanoparticles that are agglomerated or covered with the protein corona, preventing their arrival at the target site.",

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are vectors that can be used for transfecting nucleic acids as well as many other compounds. CPPs associate nucleic acids non-covalently, forming stable nanoparticles and providing efficient transfection of cells in vitro. However, in vivo, expected efficiency is achieved only in rare cases. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is formation of protein corona around nanoparticles, once they are exposed to a biological environment, e.g. blood stream. In this study, we compared CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles formed in the presence of bovine, murine and human serum. We used Western blot and mass-spectrometry to identify the major constituents of protein corona forming around nanoparticles, showing that proteins involved in transport, haemostasis and complement system are its major components. We investigated physical features of nanoparticles, and measured their biological efficiency in splice-correction assay. We showed that protein corona constituents might alter the fate of nanoparticles in vivo, e.g. by subjecting them to phagocytosis. We demonstrated that composition of protein corona of nanoparticles is species-specific that leads to dissimilar transfection efficiency and should be taken into account while developing delivery systems for nucleic acids.",

The BC changes nanoparticles' biological identity triggering activation of the immune system. As most plasma proteins are anionic at physiological pH, the biomolecular corona provides nanoparticles with a negative surface charge that generally reduces association and capture by immune cells. Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation.

Additionally, NPs may aggregate to sizes large enough to induce frustrated phagocytosis resulting in chronic inflammation and consequent risk of promoting cancer or neurodegeneration. 55 Nanoparticle Protein Corona. Usually, proteins present in biological media play the role of stabilizing agent by forming a protective protein corona on the surface of the NPs as soon as they come into contact with serum, thus preventing aggregation. 50,56 However, under certain conditions, this is not enough to prevent aggregation, for example, when working with high concentration of NPs in cell culture media or animal models (>10 12 NC/mL). 57 Nanoparticles, in general, strongly interact with macromolecules, a special case being interactions with proteins, their equivalent-sized biological counterparts. The interaction of NPs with proteins and other molecules may alter the metabolism of biological molecules, and the conjugates can be detected by the immune system, evoking a pro-inflammatory response. The protein corona also influences the interactions of NPs with the cell membrane. 58 Adsorption of proteins also modifies the surface charge 50 of the NP and therefore determines how it interacts with biological processes. 59,60 In addition, once the protein corona is formed, opsonins and proteins of the complementary system may be able to recognize proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NP which would trigger an immune response. 61,62 Additionally, conformational changes due to adsorption of proteins on the particle surface may cause lack of recognition by the organisms or may cause autoimmunity. 63 Adsorbed proteins may also influence signaling, when extracellular proteins internalize into cells carried by NPs or when binding of NPs to cells changes structure or association patterns of self-proteins. 64 The interaction of proteins with NPs may modify protein activity and structure and interfere with their natural fate. Therefore, the effect of different corona compositions on intracellular detection mechanisms needs to be investigated. In some cases, the adsorbed proteins can induce signaling by exposing new epitopes upon binding to the NP surface, 65 thus interacting with specific receptors on the cell membrane, such as receptors involved in lipoprotein trafficking, complement receptors, and pattern recognition receptors as the toll-like receptor family. 66",

SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

In particular, the recent study by Walkey and colleagues indicates that distinct protein corona signatures are indeed able to predict the cellular uptake of gold and silver NPs. 16 Hence, covering NPs with a 'physiological coating' can indeed promote or inhibit their interaction with the cellular uptake machinery, whereas the surface charge of the bare NPs appears to be less important. 6,63,65,66 onsequently, one may use this information to rationally engineer the uptake-properties of NPs by modulating the corona fingerprints. Different apolipoproteins have been described to promote transport across the blood-brain-barrier 74 and different immunoglobulins and complement factors, known as opsonins, enable uptake into monocytes 69 while dysopsonins like albumin and again apolipoproteins 14 inhibit uptake. However, these findings are mostly based on the prior knowledge of selected proteins based on their biological function in isolation. As also the functionalization of NPs with proteins seems not to (completely) prevent corona formation, the complexity of the protein corona with more than a hundred different proteins, makes it difficult to predict the impact of individual proteins in vivo. 4,6,16,75 Hence, the engineering of modified coronas by depletion or enrichment of the protein groups is required as the next step to identify corona components causally involved in (cell type specific) NP uptake.",

            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

            "text": "IFP acts as a barrier to effective drug distribution in two ways first, intensified lymphatic drainage and secondly, increased ECM stiffness in tumors [56,57]. Also, the elevated IFP engenders a steep upstream pressure gradient that obstructs particle eruption, simultaneously facilitating the convection of NPs out of the pathological tissues [56,58]. Studies show that less than 1 % of administered nanoparticles enter cancer cells. \n\nAnother factor affecting effective drug delivery is the protein corona which has a substantial impact on nanoparticle (NP) biodistribution by generating a shield of serum proteins on their surface, modifying their properties and perhaps preventing tumor targeting. Proteins are crucial biopolymers in living creatures that promote cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and mechanical support, as well as triggering biological reactions. They are also useful materials for medicinal applications, such as drug delivery systems and tissue engineering scaffolds [59]. As shown in Fig. 2, upon contact with body fluids, nanoparticles adsorb proteins, resulting in the formation of a dynamic layer known as the protein corona that regulates NP-body interactions [60]. This formation is influenced by the physicochemical properties of the NPs, the characteristics of the protein, and the biological environment [61,62]. Opsonins are present in the protein corona and assist the reticuloendothelial system in the elimination of NPs, particularly in the liver and spleen [63]. \n\nTo address this, hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are widely utilized, despite concerns regarding their stability and immunogenicity [64,65]. Zwitterionic compounds have recently received interest as stealth coatings due to their electrostatic repulsion features, which improve stealth [66][67][68][69]. Dysopsonins like clusterin and albumin can also increase the time it takes for NPs to circulate [70,71]. Pre-adsorbing particular proteins, such as CD47, has also been found to reduce macrophage absorption, resulting in improved NP delivery [72].",

            "text": "The biomolecular corona effectively determines the identity of nanoparticles (NPs) in a biological environment. 1 The formation of biomolecular corona can significantly alter the physical and chemical properties of the NP (e.g., size, charge, and hydrophobicity). 2 These changes can affect the NP's stability, aggregation, and circulation time in the body. 3 herefore, a thorough understanding of the biomolecular corona and its effects on the physicochemical properties and colloidal stability of NPs can guide their design to minimize adverse effects, making them safer for clinical applications. 4 raditionally, several methods such as liquid chromatography\u2212tandem mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis were used to be utilized to determine the corona composition. 5 hese methods commonly relay on an assumption that the NPs in each population behave similarly as far as protein adsorption to their surface is concerned and provide an averaged determination of corona composition for a given NP population. \n\nWhile various techniques, such as centrifugation, have been employed to isolate hard corona-coated NPs, 6 achieving a comprehensive in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona remains a significant challenge in the field. 7,8 The term \"in situ biomolecular corona\" refers to the corona formed on the surface of NPs in the presence of excess proteins and biomolecules. The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

            "text": "The use of short lipids-PEG able to quickly dissociate is therefore one of the preferred options to target the liver [34]. In vivo, it was then proved that nanoparticles with DMG-PEG anchor have no prolonged circulation time compared with the same particles grafted with C18-PEG, while the latter demonstrated higher stability in serum and tumor accumulation [33,35]. More recently, DMG-PEG 2000 was used in the COVID-19 Spikevax \u00ae vaccine [36], considering that an extended residence time could lead to undesirable inflammation at the injection site [37], and because, despite the lack of information, opsonization of the LNPs could also help to stimulate the immune system by promoting uptake by innate immune cells [38]. The formation of a protein corona around LNPs can therefore be seen either as a limitation or as an opportunity, depending on the application. In this context, the developed NTA method could be used to quickly screen new LNPs formulations and facilitate the rapid translation from in vitro to clinic. Its ease of implementation (low required volumes and materials) and its benefits over traditional methods to separate LNPs bound to proteins from free proteins make of this method an interesting tool. Indeed, separation methods no longer reflect the practical in vivo dynamic equilibrium between the adsorption and desorption of proteins, or the establishment of a soft corona around the high affinity proteins directly grafted around LNPs forming the hard corona [2]. \n\nThe impact of these lipids-PEG and of ionizable lipids on cellular metabolic activity was studied in tumor HeLa and HepG2 cells. In serum-free medium, LNPs induced low or no toxicity. In contrast, when used in the presence of serum, a significant impact of SM-102 LNPs with Cer-, DMG-and DTA-PEG on the metabolic activity of cells was noticed, predominantly in HepG2 cells. Considering the previously mentioned rapid desorption of C14 lipid-PEG in serum, it could be hypothesized that the transfection of cells with SM-102 LNPs lacking PEG could disturb cell metabolic activity.",

            "text": "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, there have been publications, which already reported a significant difference for the in vitro protein corona pattern if nanoparticles where incubated with serum compared to plasma [38]. However, a detailed proteomic investigation considering all different anticoagulants is still missing. First of all, we focused on the five most abundant corona proteins detected after in vitro incubation and compared to the in vivo situation (Figure 2D). The overall most abundant corona protein for all in vitro conditions is serum albumin. Next to this, for all in vitro incubations, the five most abundant proteins already constitute ~50% of the total amount of nanoparticle surface adsorbed proteins. This is in strong contrast to the in vivo situation, where these corona proteins constitute only ~10% of the total amount of nanoparticle surface adsorbed proteins. This again underlines the complexity of the in vivo protein corona pattern. Comparing the corona of the different in vitro incubated nanoparticles, we found that the corona composition of citrate and EDTA is highly similar. Hence, this protein corona pattern is different after nanoparticles were incubated with serum or heparin plasma. The protein corona after serum and heparin plasma incubation is additionally enriched with calcium-binding protein and complement C3. Both proteins bind and require calcium for their functionality [33,34]. Citrate and EDTA are both chelating calcium to prevent blood clotting and to generate plasma [39]. This can explain the difference observed for the corona composition depending on the chosen anticoagulant. Additionally, the protein corona after 2 h of in vitro incubation was compared to the 1 min incubation timepoint (Figure S2). Again, the corona pattern of heparin plasma and serum is comparable and differs from the corona of citrate and EDTA plasma. Next to this, there are only minor differences in the in vitro corona proteome analysed by LC-MS after 1 min compared to 2 h of incubation (Figure S3 and Table S1). To further characterize the in vivo corona composition, the protein pattern was monitored over time (direct recovery ~1 min of blood circulation up to 1 h).",

            "text": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) represent perfectly suitable materials for a variety of biomedical and biotechnological applications. In many cases, MNP have to penetrate into different cell types of living tissue. This tissue and cellular uptake is strongly influenced by the particle size, as well as its surface chemistry and modification with functional groups or biomolecules. A detailed investigation and clarification of the interactions between surface chemistry of the particles and living tissue is a key to understand and control cellular uptake mechanisms [1].\n\nUpon application of nanoparticles into biological media (e.g., whole-blood or plasma), the formation of a protein \"corona\" around the particles takes place immediately. This corona is a completely closed protein monolayer of a few nanometers on the surface of the nanoparticles [2] and can be divided into a \"soft\" and a \"hard\" corona [3]. In the soft corona, a permanent exchange of macromolecules from the surrounding medium and the particle surface takes place and this leads to a fast and persistent variation of the structure of the soft corona. The hard corona consists of macromolecules rather fixed to the particle surface and shows a more or less temporal constant composition. The volatility of the proteins in the soft corona aggravates a detailed investigation of the influence of the unstable part of the corona and thus most work has been spent on the investigation of the hard corona [4]. It was found that the corona is much more complex than previously considered. The influence of different particle parameters on corona formation has been already investigated. Lundquist and coworkers [5] found that for a fixed type of material, the biologically active proteins in the corona are strongly determined by the size as well as the zeta potential of the particles. Furthermore, it is well-known that the adsorption of blood serum proteins to particles is time-dependent [6]. Proteins with the highest mobility are bound to the surface first and later they will be replaced by less motile proteins which show a higher affinity to the surface. This process can take several hours. Casals et al. [7] confirmed that a soft corona loosely attached to the particles surface changes to an irreversibly attached hard corona over time.

            "text": "In the recent decade, the interest in polymeric nanocarriers for medical applications has gradually increased and accordingly a plethora of different nanoparticles have been fabricated. In particular when used as drug vectors in targeted delivery, nanocarriers could overcome many obstacles of cancer therapy. The possibility of a precise adjustment of nanocarriers' properties enables the development of specialized vectors. Nevertheless, their application is still impeded by insufficient knowledge about interactions of nanocarriers with their biological environment. \n\n2][3] This rapidly forming protein corona dramatically alters the nanocarriers' physicochemical properties including the hydrodynamic size, surface charge and aggregation behavior. Furthermore, the interaction with cell membranes and the mechanism of cellular uptake are controlled by the adsorbed proteins. Therefore, the corona defines the biological identity of nanoparticles, influencing cytotoxicity, body distribution and endocytosis into specific cells. 4,5 As it is often stated, when nanocarriers are introduced into the body, what the cells actually see is the protein corona. 1 Thus, the prediction of nanocarrier cell interactions is only possible if the protein corona is taken into account. \n\nApart from the nanocarrier surface properties, the protein corona composition is highly dependent on the biological environment. With regard to in vitro studies, experimental parameters such as cell culture medium, 6 protein concentration 7 and temperature 8 of the protein source are important factors in nanoparticle protein interactions. \n\nStudies analyzing the protein corona of nanocarriers in vitro utilize different types of protein sources and many do not further specify the type used or state reasons for their choice. Serum and plasma are often used in an interchangeable manner. The origin of the protein source, i.e. the species from which blood was drawn or the type of anticoagulant used for plasma generation is often neglected. 0][11] In contrast, serum is \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Complete list of proteins identified by LC-MS.

            "text": "The thermodynamic nature and the mechanisms of the binding process interaction between noble metal NPs with serum albumins depend partly on the size, shape, and metal type, while the chemical structure and the charge of the stabilizing ligands affect the change in optical features [42]. The proteomics of the protein corona characterize the NPs' processing, bio-distribution, toxicity, and clearance, and can also be used as a probe for diseases [43]. Authors have also observed that the albumin coating on the surface of nano-carriers may reduce the host's rejection by modulating clearance rate, detection by macrophages, and promote immune system evasion by attenuating acute immune and inflammatory responses [39]. \n\nThe protein coating adsorption from a biological fluid or serum-containing medium stabilizes the nanoparticles [41] and decreases their agglomeration in cell culture, affecting biocompatibility/toxicity, intracellular uptake and blood circulation [34,44,45]. Surface modifications of functionalized AuNPs present an impact on their cellular uptake, as cell-penetrating peptides increase NPs internalization [15,46], and their biomedical application [14,15]. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) has been used to enhance the biocompatibility of AuNPs, due to high binding affinity to gold nanoparticles, and broad pH stability [26,34]. \n\nHowever, physicochemical characteristics, such as size and charge, of gold nanoparticles prepared by laser ablation modify after incubation in serum-containing culture medium [34]. The mechanisms for AuNPs cell interaction and internalization have been hypothesized, initiated by outer membrane contact/adsorption promoting different signaling cascades, structural changes at the cell surface, and subsequent internalization [46,47]. \n\nTo understand the contribution of stem cells to tissue repair, cell tracking is important to distinguish among paracrine effects, neovascularization, and matrix deposition.",

            "text": "At the same time, the corona confers a new biological identity to nanomaterials and can affect the way nanomedicines are recognized and processed by cells [3,7,8,20,21,36,48]. Biomolecules present in the corona can, per se, have targeting capabilities towards particular receptors [17,18,[49][50][51][52]. For example, apolipoprotein B and immunoglobulin G in the corona of 100 nm silica nanoparticles incubated with human serum were found to interact with their corresponding receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively [17]. Similarly, lipid nanoparticles were efficiently targeted to the hepatocytes upon adsorption of apoE on their surface following administration [52,53]. Thus, controlling the corona composition can possibly provide new ways to control the initial interactions of nano-sized materials with cells. \n\nThe corona composition depends on nanoparticle physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, rigidity and surface characteristics [3,7,8,48,54]. By changing these properties, the corona composition might be tuned to contain components that bind to specific cell surface receptors and initiate internalization [17,49,[55][56][57]. Similarly, artificial coronas can be formed to achieve recognition by specific receptors. For instance, Tonigold and colleagues have shown that pre-adsorbed antibodies, which could be seen as a form of preformed corona, kept, at least partially, their targeting ability in the presence of serum [40]. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the effects of the corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells are being more and more recognized [41,58,59]. For example, multiple attempts have been made in trying to predict how the presence of the corona affects targeting of nanomedicines [60,61].",

It was shown that siRNA-LNP systems containing 10 mol % of DSPC exhibit maximum activity for a size of 80 nm, which suggests that to obtain smaller systems with optimized activity, higher levels of DSPC should be incorporated. 181 This was confirmed in both human adipocytes and hepatocytes, where protein expression levels for 130 nm mRNA-LNP systems differed as much as 50-fold depending on lipid compositions with a constant DLin-MC3-DMA/Chol molar ratio. The results suggest that some of these differences may be attributed to changes in surface composition of the particles and the impact this may have on the ability of LNPs to fuse with the endosomal membrane. 180,181 The proportions of different lipid species in optimized RNA-LNP systems may vary according to the particular ionizable cationic lipid employed (see Table 3). This expands considerably the possible lipid composition of an LNP system but mostly challenges researchers to find the optimal combination for a particular application. On-going efforts are put on using advanced approaches such as high-throughput screening methods and computer-assisted drug formulation, as well as implementing digitalization and artificial intelligence for developing personalized nanomedicine.\n\nBiological Interactions: PEG Shedding and the Protein Corona. In biological media, LNP dispersions will interact with the numerous biomolecules present. The exact nature of this interaction and the impact on functional delivery will undoubtedly be complex and systematic studies are needed. It is possible that serum proteins adsorb on to the surface of LNPs which could trigger uptake by surrounding macrophages (e.g., Kuppfer cells) or dendritic cells. The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid",

            "text": "Natural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

            "text": "The transformation of a particle's initial, synthetic reactivity to biological activity after interactions with proteins in a biological environment was brought to the forefront by Walkey et al. [61]. Blood plasma contains~3700 different proteins [62,63], which are present at concentrations up to 60-80 g/l [64]. There are ample opportunities for a wide variety of protein-nanoparticle interactions, and the consequences of these interactions are far reaching. First, surface proteins may either increase the nanoparticle solubility or decrease it, thereby altering bioavailability. Second, they may impact cellular or system functions (i.e., immune system) and alter a myriad of cellular signaling cascades [65]. Third, protein-nanoparticle interactions may alter the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticle relative to the reaction profiles reported in cell-free systems [59,60]. The importance of the biological consequences of protein adsorption cannot be overstated, and the interactions of metal oxide NPs with proteins are central in understanding chemical and biological activity at the bio-nano interface. Finally, the biological identity of each nanoparticle is dynamic and evolves as the nanoparticle encounters different proteins in diverse cellular environments en route to its biological targets. Each biological environment that a particle enters and leaves generates a lasting protein \"fingerprint\" reflective of the path of the nanoparticle to its destination. The serum protein fingerprint depends primarily on the size and composition of the particle, and specific fingerprints may exist for each type of NP [61,66]. The route of administration (intravenous, sub-cutaneous, oral,) will also affect the composition of the proteins adsorbed to the particle.\n\nThe biological responses to a nanoparticle following assimilation are largely defined by the dynamic nature of the protein corona around the nanoparticle and the cellular uptake process that identify the protein-NP complex [67,68]. Approximately 95% of nanomaterials that are delivered to the blood are bound by elements of the complement cascade, are rapidly sequestered by reticuloendothelial organs (i.e., spleen and liver), and never reach their intended targets [69][70][71], unless the liver or",

It was observed that the adsorption of plasma proteins leads to reduced accessibility or interaction between exogenously incorporated ligands and their targeted receptors (Fig. 5). For example, several studies reported that transferrin-coated nanoparticles showed reduced or lacking specificity towards TfR in presence of the protein corona as a result of ligand blockade [260][261][262]. The resulting \"biological identity\" was highly dependent on the composition of the protein corona. In particular, in vitro protein corona depleted targeting capability, whereas a protein corona resembling in vivo conditions caused only a reduction in specific receptormediated uptake [261].\n\nInterestingly, two studies could prove that the in vivo protein corona even enhanced the overall uptake of the nanoparticles, hypothesizing redirection of cellular uptake by the protein layer and opening new paths for particle internalization [262,263]. As a consequence, plasma protein adsorption could also lead to redirected transport to off-target cells such as the RES, which hampers selective nucleic acid delivery and efficacy. In addition, Tonigold et al. observed that antibodies covalently bound to nanoparticles lose their targeting ability almost completely in presence of serum. Particles with physically adsorbed antibodies, however, maintained their targeting ability, probably due to the fact that these antibodies were not completely exchanged or masked by serum proteins [85].\n\nTraditionally, masking the surface properties causing plasma protein adsorption is a key strategy to overcome this issue and to maintain targeting ability. PEGylation has proven to reduce undesired interactions and consequently retain ligand-accessibility which is essential for targeted delivery in vivo [41]. One approach to further attenuate particle interaction with plasma proteins is PEG \"backfilling\" (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the surface of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264",

            "text": "The low variety in protein sizes in digestion coronas compared to the serum corona has previously been reported for 50 nm neutral, carboxylated and aminated polystyrene nanoplastics [24]. \n\nThe reduced presence of serum proteins in the corona of digested+serum-coated MNPs indicates that the prior presence of digestion proteins impaired subsequent incorporation of serum proteins into the corona of all tested MNPs. Such a shielding effect of a preexisting protein corona has previously been applied to reduce blood clearance of targeted mesoporous silica by phagocytes [62]. The presence of a protein corona is known to reduce nonspecific interactions with the cellular membrane, which in turn reduces nonreceptor-mediated uptake [63], and studies have reported an inverse correlation between the amount of MNP-bound protein and cellular uptake [63,64]. The reduced amount of protein bound to the digested+serum-coated PS MNPs may therefore contribute to their higher internalization compared to serum-coated PS MNPs. The larger MNPs showed a less pronounced difference in protein abundance in their corona between serum-coated and digested+serumcoated conditions, which may explain the similar cellular uptake between the different treatments of PS500 and PS1000 MNPs. Previously it has been shown that particle surface curvature can induce protein denaturation which stimulates uptake through misfolded protein receptor mediated endocytosis [21,65,66]. The surface curvature is inversely proportional to the squared radius of a sphere and thus larger protein denaturation is expected for small MNPs compared to large MNPs. Additionally it was shown that increased misfolding of coronated proteins was related to increased cytotoxicity in isolated blood cells, highlighting the importance of this effect [67]. Future studies assessing protein denaturation on in vitro digested MNPs and whether this causes increased recognition by misfolded protein receptors may help elucidate this effect. \n\nTo investigate whether specific proteins may drive the effect of in vitro digestion on cellular uptake, the protein corona composition was characterized in detail using LC-MS-MS-based proteomics.",

What the cells see is thus not the ideal nanoparticle concocted by chemists, meaning the biomolecular corona could have great biological and physiological repercussions, sometimes masking the expected effects of purposely grafted molecules. In this review, we will mainly focus on gold nanoparticles. In the first part, we will discuss the fate of these particles once in a biological medium, especially in terms of size, and the protein composition of the corona. We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data. Given the biological consequences of this corona, we suggest that it should be taken into account in theoretical studies dealing with nanomaterials to better represent the biological environment.",

            "text": "We depleted key endocytic regulators using siRNA in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2i), and delivered our LNPs. A6 LNPs were mostly internalized through Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC-1)-mediated macropinocytosis and partially through ApoE-low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 2i). In contrast, cKK-E12 LNPs and Syn-3 LNPs relied on caveolae (CAV)-mediated endocytosis (through CAV1) (Fig. 2i). This was observed when incubating cKKE12 containing LNPs with albumin (Fig. 2j), but not with ApoE (Fig. 2k), confirming that albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis facilitates the uptake of LNPs containing cKK-E12. Finally, the mRNA delivery efficiency of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs was reduced in a dose-dependent manner during co-culture with a strong gp18 and gp30 competitor, fucoidan 29,30 , further validating our hypothesis (Fig. 2l). Overall, the above study demonstrates that the addition of A6 lipids in LNP formulations does not significantly affect the mechanism of endocytosis. In contrast, cKK-E12 lipids govern the mechanism of cellular uptake; through endocytosis of the Syn-3 LNPs via an albuminloaded protein corona. Syn-3 lipids with optimal ratios of cKK-E12 can maintain their stability and facilitate albumin binding, and are internalized through these endocytic pathways. \n\nFormulations with optimal membrane fusion and endosomal escape. The cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs showed similar levels of intracellular uptake (Fig. 2d), yet protein expression was superior in the Syn-3 LNP system containing the lipid A6 (Fig. 2e). This suggests that inclusion of A6 lipids in the LNP may increase expression by some other mechanisms.",

However, a comprehensive knowledge of particle-guided protein fingerprints and their dependence on nanomaterial properties is incomplete. We studied the long-lived (\"hard\") blood plasma derived corona on monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles differing in size (20, 30, and 100 nm). Employing label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting the composition of the protein corona was analyzed not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Detected proteins were bioinformatically classified according to their physicochemical and biological properties. Binding of the 125 identified proteins did not simply reflect their relative abundance in the plasma but revealed an enrichment of specific lipoproteins as well as proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway. In contrast, immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins displayed a lower affinity for the particles. Protein decoration of the negatively charged particles did not correlate with protein size or charge, demonstrating that electrostatic effects alone are not the major driving force regulating the nanoparticle-protein interaction. Remarkably, even differences in particle size of only 10 nm significantly determined the nanoparticle corona, although no clear correlation with particle surface volume, protein size, or charge was evident. Particle size quantitatively influenced the particle's decoration with 37% of all identified proteins, including (patho)biologically relevant candidates. We demonstrate the complexity of the plasma corona and its still unresolved physicochemical regulation, which need to be considered in nanobioscience in the future.",

Taken together, this study shows that surface functionality can be used to tune the protein corona formed on NP surface, dictating the interaction of NPs with macrophages."

This corona formation is a dynamic process that influences how the nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues, ultimately determining their therapeutic efficacy and biodistribution. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nThe protein corona forms when nanoparticles, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), come into contact with biological fluids such as blood. Within seconds of exposure, plasma proteins adsorb onto the surface of the nanoparticles, creating a dynamic layer that can substantially change the nanoparticle's size, surface charge, and biological properties. This protein coating effectively creates a new biological identity for the nanoparticle that cells \"see\" rather than the original engineered surface. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe corona formation occurs in two distinct phases: first, a \"hard\" corona of proteins with high affinity for the nanoparticle surface forms, creating a relatively stable layer; second, a more loosely bound \"soft\" corona develops through protein-protein interactions. The composition of this corona is not static but evolves over time as proteins with higher affinity displace those with lower affinity, a phenomenon known as the Vroman effect. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe specific proteins that adsorb to nanoparticles depend on multiple factors including the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties (size, shape, surface charge, hydrophobicity), the biological environment (plasma, interstitial fluid, etc.), and exposure time. For LNPs specifically used in drug and vaccine delivery, understanding this corona formation is crucial as it directly influences cellular uptake mechanisms, biodistribution patterns, immune recognition, and ultimately therapeutic efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nThe protein corona that forms around nanoparticles demonstrates selective enrichment of specific serum proteins rather than simply reflecting their relative abundance in plasma. Proteomic analysis has revealed that proteins with molecular weights between 30-60 kDa constitute the majority of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticle surfaces.

Complement proteins are also found in high abundance in many nanoparticle coronas, particularly certain formulations, which may have implications for immune system recognition. Depending on the specific nanoparticle composition, other protein classes like coagulation factors, tissue leakage proteins, and acute phase proteins may be differentially represented in the corona. <Paper corpusId=\"243474993\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nOne of the most striking observations is that serum albumin, despite being the most abundant protein in plasma (>50%), typically represents only a minor component (10% or less) of the nanoparticle corona. Similarly, macroglobulins, which are the second most abundant plasma proteins, often appear only as the 7th to 11th most abundant proteins in nanoparticle coronas. <Paper corpusId=\"243474993\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> This selective protein adsorption demonstrates that corona formation is not simply driven by protein concentration in plasma but involves complex interactions between nanoparticle surfaces and specific protein characteristics. <Paper corpusId=\"20368854\" paperTitle=\"(Tenzer et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe composition of this protein corona is not merely a function of electrostatic interactions, as protein decoration of negatively charged particles does not directly correlate with protein size or charge.

                            "In biological fluids, proteins associate with nanoparticles, leading to a protein \"corona\" defining the biological identity of the particle. However, a comprehensive knowledge of particle-guided protein fingerprints and their dependence on nanomaterial properties is incomplete. We studied the long-lived (\"hard\") blood plasma derived corona on monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles differing in size (20, 30, and 100 nm). Employing label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting the composition of the protein corona was analyzed not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Detected proteins were bioinformatically classified according to their physicochemical and biological properties. Binding of the 125 identified proteins did not simply reflect their relative abundance in the plasma but revealed an enrichment of specific lipoproteins as well as proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway. In contrast, immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins displayed a lower affinity for the particles. Protein decoration of the negatively charged particles did not correlate with protein size or charge, demonstrating that electrostatic effects alone are not the major driving force regulating the nanoparticle-protein interaction. Remarkably, even differences in particle size of only 10 nm significantly determined the nanoparticle corona, although no clear correlation with particle surface volume, protein size, or charge was evident. Particle size quantitatively influenced the particle's decoration with 37% of all identified proteins, including (patho)biologically relevant candidates. We demonstrate the complexity of the plasma corona and its still unresolved physicochemical regulation, which need to be considered in nanobioscience in the future."

                "tldr": "The protein corona dramatically alters how lipid nanoparticles interact with cells by changing receptor recognition, cellular uptake pathways, and immune system interactions. Specific proteins like apolipoproteins can enhance delivery to certain tissues (especially the liver), while complement proteins may trigger clearance, making corona composition a critical determinant of therapeutic efficacy. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nThe protein corona fundamentally transforms the biological identity of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), directly influencing their cellular interactions and tissue distribution patterns. When specific proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface, they can either facilitate or hinder cellular uptake by providing recognition motifs for cell surface receptors. Particularly, apolipoproteins (especially ApoE) play a crucial role in LNP delivery to the liver by mediating interactions with low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) that are highly expressed on hepatocytes. This explains why many LNP formulations show preferential liver accumulation, regardless of their original design intentions. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe presence of different immunoglobulins and complement proteins in the corona can trigger recognition by immune cells through Fc and complement receptors, leading to rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). This phenomenon, known as opsonization, significantly reduces circulation time and can prevent nanoparticles from reaching their intended targets. Conversely, the adsorption of specific proteins like clusterin (apolipoprotein J) or albumin may create a \"stealth\" effect that reduces immune recognition and extends circulation time. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nCoagulation factors in the corona can influence both blood compatibility and tissue targeting. When present in the corona, proteins like fibrinogen may trigger platelet activation and promote interactions with endothelial cells, potentially altering vascular permeability and tissue accumulation patterns. The presence of vitronectin and fibronectin can mediate binding to integrin receptors, affecting cellular uptake mechanisms across various tissue types. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe corona composition also determines the specific endocytic pathway by which nanoparticles enter cells. Coronas rich in certain apolipoproteins tend to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while those with abundant dysopsonins might favor caveolae-mediated uptake. These distinct entry mechanisms directly affect intracellular trafficking and ultimately determine whether the nanoparticle's cargo successfully reaches its intracellular target or becomes degraded in lysosomes. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nImportantly, the protein corona composition evolves as nanoparticles move between biological compartments, creating a \"biological history\" effect. Initial protein adsorption in blood may direct nanoparticles to specific tissues, but upon extravasation, the corona can undergo significant remodeling as it encounters interstitial fluid with different protein compositions. This dynamic evolution means that nanoparticle-cell interactions continue to change throughout their journey in the body, complicating efforts to predict and control their ultimate fate. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nUnderstanding and controlling protein corona formation has emerged as a critical consideration in LNP design. Strategies such as PEGylation, incorporation of specific targeting ligands that remain accessible despite corona formation, or pre-coating nanoparticles with desired proteins are being explored to overcome the biological barriers imposed by uncontrolled corona formation and to achieve more precise cellular targeting and tissue distribution profiles. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",
