This review presents the phage display technology, application areas of antibodies in research, diagnostics and therapy and the use of antibody phage display for these applications.\n## Antibodies for Diagnostics\nThere are three general ways to use antibodies for diagnostics.The first way is the detection of antigens using antibodies [77] and the second, but reversed way is the detection of serum antibodies using antigens [78].The third way is the competition assay, here, e.g., antigens are detected by serum antibodies which compete with a defined antibody preparation [79].The advantage of an antibody competition assay is its species independence [80].Other prominent technologies used for diagnostics are lateral flow strip assays [81,82], bead based assays such as Luminex [83], flow cytometry [58,84], the hemagglutination assay [85], and more recently, the proximity ligation assay [86] or molecular imaging [87].An interesting diagnostic method is the direct use of phage particles fused to antibodies [88] for diagnostics.Sensitivity of the diagnostic assay can be enhanced by detection of the about 2700 copies of pVIII of an antibody phage by secondary antibodies [89,90].Antibody phage particles can also be used for immuno-PCR [91].\n\nTo date, there are many examples for the application of antibodies derived by phage display for diagnostics [92][93][94].A big advantage of antibody phage display for diagnostics is the direct access to the genetic information of the binder, allowing a fast adaption of the antibody format e.g., IgG, scFv-Fc, biotinylated antibody or scFv-phoA fusion [40] to the desired diagnostic assay.\n\nPhage display allows also the identification of immunogenic proteins, e.g., from pathogens [95][96][97].Combining antibody phage display with antigen phage display all steps from identification of antigens to the generation of antibodies against these antigens for diagnostics are available.",

            "abstract": "Traditional vaccines use inactivated or weakened forms of pathogens which could have side effects and inadequate immune responses. To overcome these challenges, phage display has emerged as a valuable tool for identifying specific epitopes that could be used in vaccines. This review emphasizes the direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development, filling a crucial gap in the field. This technique allows vaccines to be engineered to effectively stimulate the immune system by presenting carefully selected epitopes. Phage display involves screening libraries of random peptides or gene/genome fragments using serum samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. This method has been used to identify epitopes from various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis viruses, H5N1, HIV-1, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Dirofilaria repens. Bacteriophages offer advantages such as being immunogenic carriers, low production costs, and customization options, making them a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, which could provide significant advantages in critical scenarios such as pandemics.",

ELISAs employ these epitopes as capture antigens immobilized on a solid surface, allowing for the detection and quantification of specific antibodies present in patient samples. On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen. This aspect is particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tests capable of detecting a wide range of pathogen variants [56]. By incorporating epitopes of a pathogen into diagnostic assays, the accuracy and efficiency of pathogen detection and identification are significantly enhanced. \n\nThese diagnostic assays provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, empowering them to make timely decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies. The incorporation of pathogenic epitopes into these tests ultimately contributes to improved patient care and outcomes.",

This critical step aims to eliminate non-specific binders in the library and clones that may bind to the constant part of the antibodies. To mitigate any potential interference during the panning process, it is recommended to add these antibodies to the phage library. One approach to achieving this is by incubating the serum sample on a surface coated with helper phages (e.g., for phagemid M13) or the original phage without an insert (e.g., for T7 phage) This effectively removes phage-specific antibodies before further utilization. \n\nAfter obtaining the selected hits, it is important to optimize them if needed, possibly through techniques like site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a thorough characterization of the hits is necessary to assess their antibody binding capability, their potential to elicit an immune response, and the effectiveness of that immune response. \n\nThe epitopes of a pathogen identified through phage display have diverse applications, including the development of diagnostic tests, understanding pathogen-host interactions, and the creation of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines. \n\nMoreover, numerous studies have employed phage display techniques in the context of infectious diseases, using two key components: a phage display library and antibodies from samples taken from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. For instance, in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), mimotopes were identified using antibodies from hepatitis A patients. One of the identified phages exhibited the ability to hinder the attachment of anti-HAV antibodies, eliciting a specific immune response in mice. Similarly, phage display libraries were utilized to discover mimotopes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), leading to the generation of highly specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mimotopes of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein were identified using serum from an HCV-infected patient.",

                    "text": "The identification and selection of epitopes play a crucial role in the development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic antibodies. Various techniques are available for this purpose, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, peptide arrays, site-directed mutagenesis, bioinformatics and computational modeling, and phage display. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and the type of epitope or mimotope under investigation. Among these techniques, phage display stands out due to its simplicity in epitope selection and screening. Moreover, the resulting phagosomes can be used as vaccines without requiring additional manipulation. \n\nTo successfully select epitopes or mimotopes using phage display, several important steps must be carefully executed. Firstly, a phage display library is needed to facilitate the selection of target epitopes. These libraries can either be constructed in-house or obtained as pre-made libraries, such as those provided by New England Biolabs. There are two main types of libraries commonly used: random phage display peptide libraries (RPL) and gene or genome fragment libraries (GFL). Each type of library has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the specific research question, the nature of the target protein, and the available resources. \n\nObtaining the appropriate source of antibodies is another critical aspect when selecting epitopes for the library. These antibodies can be derived from patients who are recovering from an infectious disease or individuals who have been immunized with a vaccine. It's important to note that these antibodies need to undergo purification using protein A/G affinity chromatography or antigen-based chromatography, if the antigen is available, to ensure that selection is not biased against other components present in the samples. However, it should be acknowledged that serum samples typically contain polyclonal antibodies, which necessitates a screening assay following the selection process. \n\nBefore commencing the selection or biopanning process, two protocols must be prepared and optimized. The first protocol involves biopanning the library, wherein a pool of phage clones recognized by the antibodies is selected. The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay.",

Palma\n## Abstract\nTraditional vaccines use inactivated or weakened forms of pathogens which could have side effects and inadequate immune responses. To overcome these challenges, phage display has emerged as a valuable tool for identifying specific epitopes that could be used in vaccines. This review emphasizes the direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development, filling a crucial gap in the field. This technique allows vaccines to be engineered to effectively stimulate the immune system by presenting carefully selected epitopes. Phage display involves screening libraries of random peptides or gene/genome fragments using serum samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. This method has been used to identify epitopes from various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis viruses, H5N1, HIV-1, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Dirofilaria repens. Bacteriophages offer advantages such as being immunogenic carriers, low production costs, and customization options, making them a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, which could provide significant advantages in critical scenarios such as pandemics.\n## Diagnostic Test Development\nThe epitopes of a pathogen have significant potential in the development of diagnostic tests, such as ELISAs or lateral flow assays, to improve their accuracy and efficiency. ELISAs employ these epitopes as capture antigens immobilized on a solid surface, allowing for the detection and quantification of specific antibodies present in patient samples. On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen. This aspect is particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tests capable of detecting a wide range of pathogen variants [56]. By incorporating epitopes of a pathogen into diagnostic assays, the accuracy and efficiency of pathogen detection and identification are significantly enhanced. \n\nThese diagnostic assays provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, empowering them to make timely decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies. The incorporation of pathogenic epitopes into these tests ultimately contributes to improved patient care and outcomes.\n\n## Discussion\nThe identification and selection of epitopes play a crucial role in the development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic antibodies. Various techniques are available for this purpose, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, peptide arrays, site-directed mutagenesis, bioinformatics and computational modeling, and phage display. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and the type of epitope or mimotope under investigation. Among these techniques, phage display stands out due to its simplicity in epitope selection and screening. Moreover, the resulting phagosomes can be used as vaccines without requiring additional manipulation. \n\nTo successfully select epitopes or mimotopes using phage display, several important steps must be carefully executed. Firstly, a phage display library is needed to facilitate the selection of target epitopes. These libraries can either be constructed in-house or obtained as pre-made libraries, such as those provided by New England Biolabs. There are two main types of libraries commonly used: random phage display peptide libraries (RPL) and gene or genome fragment libraries (GFL). Each type of library has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the specific research question, the nature of the target protein, and the available resources. \n\nObtaining the appropriate source of antibodies is another critical aspect when selecting epitopes for the library. These antibodies can be derived from patients who are recovering from an infectious disease or individuals who have been immunized with a vaccine. It's important to note that these antibodies need to undergo purification using protein A/G affinity chromatography or antigen-based chromatography, if the antigen is available, to ensure that selection is not biased against other components present in the samples. However, it should be acknowledged that serum samples typically contain polyclonal antibodies, which necessitates a screening assay following the selection process. \n\nBefore commencing the selection or biopanning process, two protocols must be prepared and optimized. The first protocol involves biopanning the library, wherein a pool of phage clones recognized by the antibodies is selected. The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay.\n...\nThe second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay. \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined in the biopanning process, it is essential to highlight the importance of performing a subtractive selection using antibodies from negative samples. This critical step aims to eliminate non-specific binders in the library and clones that may bind to the constant part of the antibodies. To mitigate any potential interference during the panning process, it is recommended to add these antibodies to the phage library. One approach to achieving this is by incubating the serum sample on a surface coated with helper phages (e.g., for phagemid M13) or the original phage without an insert (e.g., for T7 phage) This effectively removes phage-specific antibodies before further utilization. \n\nAfter obtaining the selected hits, it is important to optimize them if needed, possibly through techniques like site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a thorough characterization of the hits is necessary to assess their antibody binding capability, their potential to elicit an immune response, and the effectiveness of that immune response. \n\nThe epitopes of a pathogen identified through phage display have diverse applications, including the development of diagnostic tests, understanding pathogen-host interactions, and the creation of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines. \n\nMoreover, numerous studies have employed phage display techniques in the context of infectious diseases, using two key components: a phage display library and antibodies from samples taken from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. For instance, in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), mimotopes were identified using antibodies from hepatitis A patients. One of the identified phages exhibited the ability to hinder the attachment of anti-HAV antibodies, eliciting a specific immune response in mice. Similarly, phage display libraries were utilized to discover mimotopes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), leading to the generation of highly specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mimotopes of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein were identified using serum from an HCV-infected patient.",

These antibodies are described in the section \"recombinant antibodies against toxins.\" The majority of antibodies against bacteria are developed in order to facilitate diagnostics in patients [67,68] and environmental samples [69,70]. In general, cultural and microbial detection of bacteria is regarded as standard in diagnostics for many pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [71] or Salmonella Typhimurium [72]. Since these methods are often time-consuming and require experienced lab personal, high throughput analysis is often limited. Real-time PCR measurements have been developed for the diagnostics of many bacteria [73], offering high sensitivity and specificity of detection. But sample treatment is still needed in many cases, including expensive and complex laboratory devices [74]. An other approach is MS for diagnostic, but this technology needs expensive devices [75].

Kuhn, Viola F\u00fchner, Tobias Unkauf, G. Moreira, A. Frenzel, Sebastian Miethe, M. Hust\n## Abstract\nAntibodies are valuable molecules for the diagnostic and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and toxins. Traditionally, these antibodies are generated by hybridoma technology. An alternative to hybridoma technology is the use of antibody phage display to generate recombinant antibodies. This in vitro technology circumvents the limitations of the immune system and allows\u2014in theory\u2014the generation of antibodies against all conceivable molecules. Phage display technology enables obtaining human antibodies from na\u00efve antibody gene libraries when either patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. On the other hand, if patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is common to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity\u2010matured antibodies. Because the phage packaged DNA sequence encoding the antibodies is directly available, the antibodies can be smoothly engineered according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins for diagnostics and therapy is given.\n## Recombinant antibodies against bacteria\nThe most therapeutic antibodies against bacterial targets are generated against toxins. These antibodies are described in the section \"recombinant antibodies against toxins.\" The majority of antibodies against bacteria are developed in order to facilitate diagnostics in patients [67,68] and environmental samples [69,70]. In general, cultural and microbial detection of bacteria is regarded as standard in diagnostics for many pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [71] or Salmonella Typhimurium [72]. Since these methods are often time-consuming and require experienced lab personal, high throughput analysis is often limited. Real-time PCR measurements have been developed for the diagnostics of many bacteria [73], offering high sensitivity and specificity of detection. But sample treatment is still needed in many cases, including expensive and complex laboratory devices [74]. An other approach is MS for diagnostic, but this technology needs expensive devices [75]. Antibody-based diagnostic like ELISA would be more simple and easy to use, also in developing countries. \n\nIn order to generate antibodies with the desired-binding properties, phage-display has been used to select antibodies on proteins or polysaccharides of Chlamydophila psittaci [76], Chlamydia trachomatis [77], Haemophilus influenzae [78], Listeria monocytogenes [79], Mycobaterium bovis [35], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [68,80,81], Porphyromonas gingivalis [67], Ralstonia solanacearum [69], Salmonella Typhimurium [2,82], and Yersinia pestis [83]. But even selections on cell lysate or whole cells were performed on Mycobacterium avium [84], Bacillus anthracis [70,85], Moraxella catarrhalis [86], Lawsonia intracellularis [87], Lactobacillus acidophilus [88], Helicobacter pylori [89], Brucella melitensis [90], and Bordetella pertussis [91].\n\n## Eukaryotic pathogens\nIn 2009, Sch\u00fctte et al. [41] reported the generation of several antibodies binding specifically to Crf2, an A. fumigates antigen of the glycosyl hydrolase family that is located in the cell wall of the growing hyphae. These antibodies could serve as tools for new diagnostic assays such as serum ELISA or histopathological immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies described in this study were isolated from two different phage-displayed scFv libraries: One was a macaque immune library with a theoretical diversity of 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 independent clones; while the other was human na\u00efve antibody library HAL4/7 [23]. Both libraries were used in two different panning strategies: the first was performed on recombinant antigen immobilized on immunostrips; the second was carried out in solution with biotinylated antigen. Finally, 16 individual scFv clones were selected, with six clones deriving from the na\u00efve library and ten from the immune library. Interestingly, all antibodies generated on immobilized antigen bind to linear epitopes, whereas all antibodies generated by panning in solution bind to conformational epitopes. Seven of these antibodies bound to their native antigen on growing hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and did not show crossreactions to other Aspergillus species or Candida albicans. \n\nMalaria is a life-threatening protozoal infection of the red blood cells and one of the most common mosquito-borne diseases. Currently, an estimated 3.2 billion people in tropical and subtropical countries live at risk of malaria [173,174]. In humans malaria is elicited by at least five different species of Plasmodium, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi [175]. P. falciparum is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally, while P. vivax is the most widespread parasite [176]. Three different approaches to generate antibodies against P. falciparum using phage display are described. In these studies various structures of different developmental stages of the parasite served as antigens.",

It helps create antibodies that can specifically bind to complex antigens, which is crucial for identifying biomarkers and improving diagnostics and treatments. However, existing reviews often overlook its importance in areas outside cancer research. This review aims to fill that gap by explaining the basics of phage display and its applications in detecting and treating various non-cancerous diseases. We focus especially on its role in degenerative diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and chronic non-communicable diseases, showing how it is changing the way we diagnose and treat illnesses. By highlighting important discoveries and future possibilities, we hope to emphasize the significance of phage display in modern healthcare.\n## The Diagnostic Effectiveness of Phage Display Technology\nNumerous recombinant antibodies and peptides against pathogens and cancer antigens have been developed for diagnostic purposes using phage display.Peptides generated by phage display have the potential to be exploited for molecular imaging diagnostics in the field of cancer [19].These peptides can be employed in imaging various malignancies by conjugating or labeling them with nanoparticles, radionuclides, and fluorescents.The conventional method for tumor imaging is performed by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with whole size.Peptides could be more effective than antibodies because of their low molecular weight which provides better tumor penetration and low immunogenicity because of lacking Fc regions [20,21].\n\nIn one study, for example, a peptide with specific binding capabilities to the extracellular domain of HER3 (HER3P1) was produced by the phage display technique [22].Traditional HER3 imaging, which uses a radiolabeled full-size antibody-like patritumab, does not lead to accurate PET imaging since these antibodies exhibit weak tumor penetration and non-specific accumulation in tissues that are not the target [23,24].It demonstrated that the radiolabeled HER3P1 had a potential for application in clinical imaging as it showed a great specificity and low background uptake by in vivo PET imaging [22].\n\nEmploying phage display, a diverse set of recombinant antibodies for pathogen detection (e.g., bacteria and viruses) has been developed.Since this technology comprises an in vitro screening procedure, it has eliminated the limitations and constraints of hybridoma technology [25].The majority of these antibodies, which are antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and nanobodies, are applied in ELISA, immunoblot, immunofluorescent assays, and immunoprecipitation [26].\n\nAlthough generating monoclonal antibodies is both an expensive and time-consuming task, they are widely deployed in immunological tests.In contrast, phage display allows for the quick collection of recombinant antibodies at a low cost and with the same affinity.Furthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.\n\n## Future Perspective\nDue to the extensive applications of phages, ongoing research endeavors may be dedicated to integrating this technology with other fields such as nanotechnology, therapeutic pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tools, and machine learning to optimize its advantages.Engineered phage particles combined with nanoparticles may offer a more secure and efficient means of delivering therapeutic cargo to specific cells associated with certain health conditions.Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to transform phage display libraries.Utilizing deep sequencing data [150] and machine learning [151] can help identify sequence spaces containing functional variants enriched in deep sequencing data.Consequently, this approach aids in recognizing, categorizing, and quantifying features relevant to diagnostics and therapy [150][151][152].\n\nBy leveraging phage libraries to screen for peptides or antibodies targeting specific disease-related molecules, we can uncover novel diagnostics and therapeutics.For infectious diseases, this approach offers avenues for discovering new antibiotics and antiviral agents, aiding in rapid detection and treatment.Similarly, in autoimmune disorders, phage display enables the identification of mimotopes that mimic self-antigens, paving the way for innovative immunotherapies.Moreover, in neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and rare diseases, phage display presents opportunities for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic tools tailored to the unique characteristics of each condition.Looking ahead, the future of phage display in non-cancerous diseases is poised for transformative advancements.With ongoing progress in high-throughput screening techniques and computational modeling, we can expedite the discovery and optimization of phage-derived molecules for clinical applications.Furthermore, the integration of phage display with other cutting-edge technologies, such as CRISPR-based genome editing and single-cell sequencing, holds the potential to unlock new insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.Envisioning the future of diagnostic applications, user-friendly, secure, and cost-effective phage-based biosensors could evolve into lab-on-a-chip devices, becoming readily available in households for the early detection of various diseases expressing specific biomarkers.",

Typically, antibody tests detect antibodies against proteins (antigens) to only one or a few viruses. Here, we review an emerging technology called Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), that allows us to study the infection history of individuals to large numbers of viruses simultaneously. This technology uses bacteriophages to express and display viral antigens of choice, which are then bound by antigen-specific antibodies in patient samples. Antibody-bound bacteriophages are pulled down and identified through molecular techniques. This technology has been used in various infectious disease scenarios, including assessing exposure to different viruses, studying vaccine responses, and identifying viral cause of diseases. Despite inherent limitations in presenting only peptides, this technology holds great promise for future application in identifying novel pathogens, one health and pandemic preparedness. Abstract Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a high throughput serological technology that is revolutionizing the manner in which we track antibody profiles. In this review, we mainly focus on its application to viral infectious diseases. Through the pull-down of patient antibodies using peptide-tile-expressing T7 bacteriophages and detection using next-generation sequencing (NGS), PhIP-Seq allows the determination of antibody repertoires against peptide targets from hundreds of proteins and pathogens. It differs from conventional serological techniques in that PhIP-Seq does not require protein expression and purification. It also allows for the testing of many samples against the whole virome. PhIP-Seq has been successfully applied in many infectious disease investigations concerning seroprevalence, risk factors, time trends, etiology of disease, vaccinology, and emerging pathogens. Despite the inherent limitations of this technology, we foresee the future expansion of PhIP-Seq in both investigative studies and tracking of current, emerging, and novel viruses. Following the review of PhIP-Seq technology, its limitations, and applications, we recommend that PhIP-Seq be integrated into national surveillance programs and be used in conjunction with molecular techniques to support both One Health and pandemic preparedness efforts.",

                    "text": "A large number of recombinant antibodies for application in diagnostics and therapy were already generated by phage display against viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. Antibody phage display allows the generation of antibodies originating from several species, including human, camel, llama, alpaca, chimpanzee, macaque, pig, mice, chicken or shark. These antibodies are derived from two types of library  sources: immune or universal libraries. Immune libraries are preferred when convalescent patients or immunized animals/ human donors are available. This approach offers the advantage to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. Universal antibody gene libraries offer an alternative if immunization is not possible, ethically not feasible or patient samples are not available. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic should teach us to be prepared for the next pandemic, which beyond any doubt will come. We need permanent preparedness platforms which will react on novel pathogens arising worldwide and provide antibodies for diagnostics and as potential therapeutic lead candidates. This preparedness platforms should also have a budget for immediate start of GMP production and clinical phase I/II studies. In the most cases, new pathogens may have only a local impact, but this cannot be assured. Also these antibodies are always valuable tools for research and diagnostics of the pathogens. \n\nWe do not build a fire department when the house is already burning, we need to establish it in advance and maintain this service also in times without emergency. We have to think in the same way about infectious diseases and potential pandemics.",

                    "text": "Toxins are the most frequent antigenic target of therapeutic antibodies used to fight bacterial pathogens. This topic is thoroughly discussed in a dedicated paragraph: \"targeting of toxins with recombinant antibodies\". Excluding toxin antigens, antibodies raised against bacteria are predominantly used in diagnostics (Skottrup et al., 2011;Ferrara et al., 2012) and to assess the presence of contamination in environmental samples (Griep et al., 1998;Mechaly et al., 2008). As of today, microbiologic bacteria identification by cultivation remains the benchmark approach for the diagnostic of several pathogenic bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Norbis et al., 2014), Salmonella Typhimurium (Kuhn et al., 2012), or Listeria monocytogenes (Gasanov et al., 2005). \n\nThe many drawbacks of these methods are the low throughput and high costs caused by their inherently long experimental duration, the higher risk of exposure to pathogenic organisms and the need of highly trained personnel. Real-time PCR and other molecular diagnostics approaches have been introduced to reduce the time needed for the identification of many bacteria (Liang et al., 2018), while offering high detection sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, such methods most often depend on the availability of laboratory infrastructure and, if portable, are less amenable to high throughput parallelized measurements (Xu et al., 2020). Similarly, mass spectrometry is able to provide high sensitivity, however, this technology requires expensive devices and trained personnel (Dixon et al., 2015). On the other hand, antibody-based detection methods such as ELISA and immunochromatography, are faster, simpler, and well-suited for high-throughput. These features, together with the lower costs compared to other techniques, contributed to the success of these diagnostic approaches world-wide, including developing countries, where resources may be scarce and laboratories sparsely distributed over the territory. \n\nUp to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1).",

Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.",

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.\n## RECOMBINANT ANTIBODIES AGAINST BACTERIA\nToxins are the most frequent antigenic target of therapeutic antibodies used to fight bacterial pathogens. This topic is thoroughly discussed in a dedicated paragraph: \"targeting of toxins with recombinant antibodies\". Excluding toxin antigens, antibodies raised against bacteria are predominantly used in diagnostics (Skottrup et al., 2011;Ferrara et al., 2012) and to assess the presence of contamination in environmental samples (Griep et al., 1998;Mechaly et al., 2008). As of today, microbiologic bacteria identification by cultivation remains the benchmark approach for the diagnostic of several pathogenic bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Norbis et al., 2014), Salmonella Typhimurium (Kuhn et al., 2012), or Listeria monocytogenes (Gasanov et al., 2005). \n\nThe many drawbacks of these methods are the low throughput and high costs caused by their inherently long experimental duration, the higher risk of exposure to pathogenic organisms and the need of highly trained personnel. Real-time PCR and other molecular diagnostics approaches have been introduced to reduce the time needed for the identification of many bacteria (Liang et al., 2018), while offering high detection sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, such methods most often depend on the availability of laboratory infrastructure and, if portable, are less amenable to high throughput parallelized measurements (Xu et al., 2020). Similarly, mass spectrometry is able to provide high sensitivity, however, this technology requires expensive devices and trained personnel (Dixon et al., 2015). On the other hand, antibody-based detection methods such as ELISA and immunochromatography, are faster, simpler, and well-suited for high-throughput. These features, together with the lower costs compared to other techniques, contributed to the success of these diagnostic approaches world-wide, including developing countries, where resources may be scarce and laboratories sparsely distributed over the territory. \n\nUp to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1).\n...\ndetection. Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nA large number of recombinant antibodies for application in diagnostics and therapy were already generated by phage display against viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. Antibody phage display allows the generation of antibodies originating from several species, including human, camel, llama, alpaca, chimpanzee, macaque, pig, mice, chicken or shark. These antibodies are derived from two types of library  sources: immune or universal libraries. Immune libraries are preferred when convalescent patients or immunized animals/ human donors are available. This approach offers the advantage to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. Universal antibody gene libraries offer an alternative if immunization is not possible, ethically not feasible or patient samples are not available. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic should teach us to be prepared for the next pandemic, which beyond any doubt will come. We need permanent preparedness platforms which will react on novel pathogens arising worldwide and provide antibodies for diagnostics and as potential therapeutic lead candidates. This preparedness platforms should also have a budget for immediate start of GMP production and clinical phase I/II studies. In the most cases, new pathogens may have only a local impact, but this cannot be assured. Also these antibodies are always valuable tools for research and diagnostics of the pathogens. \n\nWe do not build a fire department when the house is already burning, we need to establish it in advance and maintain this service also in times without emergency. We have to think in the same way about infectious diseases and potential pandemics.",

Nine phage-displayed nanobodies specifically to Cry2A were obtained from a naive nanobody library after four rounds of biopanning. The phage-displayed nanobody P2 with high affinity binding was selected as the detection antibody for the sensitive DAS-CLIA development. The proposed method exhibited high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.09\u2005ng/mL, has a wide linear range for Cry2A toxin detection, in the range of 0.1\u20131000\u2005ng/mL and negligible cross-reactivities to the other Bt toxins. The recoveries of Cry2A toxin spiked in cereal samples (rice, wheat, and corn) ranged from 82.7% to 118%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 10%. This study demonstrated that the DAS-CLIA procedure based on phage-displayed nanobodies may provide an alternative sensitive method for the detection of Bt toxins in agri-products.

With these unique features, nanobody-based approaches are becoming promising tools for diagnostic applications (Li et al., 2014). \n\nWhen compared with the traditional antibodies or soluble nanobodies, phage-displayed nanobodies have the advantages of ease of production, reproducibility and lowcost. Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure. Meanwhile, the affinity of nanobody P2 could be improved by site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acids in CDR3.",

Nine phage-displayed nanobodies specifically to Cry2A were obtained from a naive nanobody library after four rounds of biopanning. The phage-displayed nanobody P2 with high affinity binding was selected as the detection antibody for the sensitive DAS-CLIA development. The proposed method exhibited high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.09\u2005ng/mL, has a wide linear range for Cry2A toxin detection, in the range of 0.1\u20131000\u2005ng/mL and negligible cross-reactivities to the other Bt toxins. The recoveries of Cry2A toxin spiked in cereal samples (rice, wheat, and corn) ranged from 82.7% to 118%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 10%. This study demonstrated that the DAS-CLIA procedure based on phage-displayed nanobodies may provide an alternative sensitive method for the detection of Bt toxins in agri-products. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n## Assay validation\nNanobodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, are the smallest intact antigen binding fragments with high affinity, stability, solubility and contain a long CDR3 loop, which have access to the clefts and cavities of target proteins. With these unique features, nanobody-based approaches are becoming promising tools for diagnostic applications (Li et al., 2014). \n\nWhen compared with the traditional antibodies or soluble nanobodies, phage-displayed nanobodies have the advantages of ease of production, reproducibility and lowcost. Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure. Meanwhile, the affinity of nanobody P2 could be improved by site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acids in CDR3.",

Perhaps the best-known application of phages is phage display that refers to the expression of foreign peptides or proteins outside the phage virion as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins. In 2018, one half of the Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter \u201cfor the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\u201d The outstanding technology has evolved and developed considerably since its first description in 1985, and today phage display is commonly used in a wide variety of disciplines, including drug discovery, enzyme optimization, biomolecular interaction studies, as well as biosensor development. A cornerstone of all biosensors, regardless of the sensor platform or transduction scheme used, is a sensitive and selective bioreceptor, or a recognition element, that can provide specific binding to the target analyte. Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.",

Antibody fragments, mostly singlechain variable fragments (scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of advantage. 87 Other common recombinant antibody fragments include the heavychain antibodies (V HH ), also known as nanobodies or singledomain antibodies, which have gained significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is completely devoid of the light chains. 66,93 Alternatively, short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency. Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications. Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects. Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. \n\nRecombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes have been published recently using other transduction techniques, for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic, and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets (Table 1), but for a comprehensive overview of phagebased biosensors, we refer the reader to recent review articles. 7,91,92,94",

Benito-Pe\u00f1a, R. Barderas, M. Moreno-Bondi\n## Abstract\nPhages are bacterial viruses that have gained a significant role in biotechnology owing to their widely studied biology and many advantageous characteristics. Perhaps the best-known application of phages is phage display that refers to the expression of foreign peptides or proteins outside the phage virion as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins. In 2018, one half of the Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter \u201cfor the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\u201d The outstanding technology has evolved and developed considerably since its first description in 1985, and today phage display is commonly used in a wide variety of disciplines, including drug discovery, enzyme optimization, biomolecular interaction studies, as well as biosensor development. A cornerstone of all biosensors, regardless of the sensor platform or transduction scheme used, is a sensitive and selective bioreceptor, or a recognition element, that can provide specific binding to the target analyte. Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.\n## ACS Omega\nPerspective pathogen, 92 or phages can be utilized as a means to display the biorecognition element, be it an antibody fragment, a peptide, or any other protein binder. Antibody fragments, mostly singlechain variable fragments (scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of advantage. 87 Other common recombinant antibody fragments include the heavychain antibodies (V HH ), also known as nanobodies or singledomain antibodies, which have gained significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is completely devoid of the light chains. 66,93 Alternatively, short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency. Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications. Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects. Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. \n\nRecombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes have been published recently using other transduction techniques, for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic, and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets (Table 1), but for a comprehensive overview of phagebased biosensors, we refer the reader to recent review articles. 7,91,92,94\n...\nntibody fragments originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported for various protein targets, such as scFv against dengue virus nonstructural protein 103 or single variable domain antibodies (V HH ) from camel against prostatespecific antigen (PSA) that were applied to PSA detection by SPR. 104,105 Also, various peptide binders against protein targets have been selected by phage display, for example, for the development of biosensors applied to the analysis of protein targets, such as cholera toxin, 106 troponin I, 107 prostate-specific antigen, 108 norovirus capsid proteins, 109,110 alanine aminotransferase, 111 and sepsis 112 or dengue fever biomarkers. 113 ecently, a SERS biosensor based on M13 phages that display cysteine-rich peptides on the pVIII was developed for triplex assay in sepsis diagnosis. The assays on magnetic templates with picomolar detection limits was described as a promising alternative for early clinical diagnosis of sepsis. 114 mall-molecule targets, haptens, which might be challenging targets for antibody development, have been also successfully used to develop antibodies by phage display. The selection and application of scFvs against various targets, such as morphines, 115 mycotoxins, 116\u2212118 and environmental toxins including microcystins, 119,120",

                    "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

Z. Chan, A. H. Chan, A. P. Lim, B. Hanson\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nAntibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

The emergence of novel virulence serotypes raises public health concerns, potentially compromising existing detection methods. Hence, exploiting Vibrio cholerae toxin testing holds promise due to its inherent stability. Immunobiosensors, leveraging antibody specificity and sensitivity, present formidable tools for detecting diverse small molecules, encompassing drugs, hormones, toxins, and environmental pollutants. This review explores cholera toxin detection, highlighting phage display-based nano immunosensors\u2019 potential. Engineered bacteriophages exhibit exceptional cholera toxin affinity, through specific antibody fragments or mimotopes, enabling precise quantification. This innovative approach promises to reshape cholera toxin detection, offering an alternative to animal-derived methods. Harnessing engineered bacteriophages aligns with ethical detection and emphasizes sensitivity and accuracy, a pivotal stride in the evolution of detection strategies.

                    "text": "Thus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection. \n\nIn practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

                    "text": "Phage display technology (Figure 3) emerges as the primary method for preparing mimicking peptides, vital in toxin detection. These polypeptides mimic antigen epitopes and entail genetic modification of phage DNA. By binding to a phage coat protein, peptides, proteins, and antibody fragments are expressed on the phage surface. Additionally, the introduction of exogenous DNA sequences permits the display of related genes and their products on the phage surface (58,59). Moreover, the protein or peptide maintains its ability to recognize molecular targeted binding sites (60). In 1985, Smith pioneered the phage display technique, fusing the restriction endonuclease EcoR I with the PIII protein as a recombinant small coat protein (61). Subsequently, the shell proteins PVIII and PVI were also employed for phage display (62-64), with the innovative proposal of a dual display system (65). The M13 phages utilized in phage display can be classified into different carriers, including 3 + 3, 6 + 6, and 8 + 8 types. Phage vectors are primarily categorized into type 3/8 and type 33/88 vectors based on the number of displayed exogenous peptides (66). Phage display technology, renowned for its remarkable specificity and sensitivity, finds extensive application in nano immunosensor development for toxin detection. This versatile tool excels in epitope mapping and identifying mimotopes for diverse antigens. In essence, phage display technology stands as a potent approach for crafting highly specific and sensitive nano immunosensors, revolutionizing cholera toxin detection in water sources. \n\nPhage display technology has revolutionized protein engineering and drug discovery. Among the most common type are random peptide libraries, showcasing millions of epitopes that aid in identifying specific binding peptides for various targets, including microorganisms, organ tissues, and nanoparticles (67). Biopanning enables the selection of peptides with high affinity and selectivity towards their targets (68). The advancement of cyclic peptides has further bolstered the technology, yielding peptides with enhanced stability and bioactivity.",

Despite the plate method\u2019s gold standard status for detection, its time-consuming nature, taking several days to provide results, remains a challenge. The emergence of novel virulence serotypes raises public health concerns, potentially compromising existing detection methods. Hence, exploiting Vibrio cholerae toxin testing holds promise due to its inherent stability. Immunobiosensors, leveraging antibody specificity and sensitivity, present formidable tools for detecting diverse small molecules, encompassing drugs, hormones, toxins, and environmental pollutants. This review explores cholera toxin detection, highlighting phage display-based nano immunosensors\u2019 potential. Engineered bacteriophages exhibit exceptional cholera toxin affinity, through specific antibody fragments or mimotopes, enabling precise quantification. This innovative approach promises to reshape cholera toxin detection, offering an alternative to animal-derived methods. Harnessing engineered bacteriophages aligns with ethical detection and emphasizes sensitivity and accuracy, a pivotal stride in the evolution of detection strategies. This review primarily introduces recent advancements in phage display-based nano immunosensors for cholera toxin, encompassing technical aspects, current challenges, and future prospects.\n## Phage display technology\nPhage display technology (Figure 3) emerges as the primary method for preparing mimicking peptides, vital in toxin detection. These polypeptides mimic antigen epitopes and entail genetic modification of phage DNA. By binding to a phage coat protein, peptides, proteins, and antibody fragments are expressed on the phage surface. Additionally, the introduction of exogenous DNA sequences permits the display of related genes and their products on the phage surface (58,59). Moreover, the protein or peptide maintains its ability to recognize molecular targeted binding sites (60). In 1985, Smith pioneered the phage display technique, fusing the restriction endonuclease EcoR I with the PIII protein as a recombinant small coat protein (61). Subsequently, the shell proteins PVIII and PVI were also employed for phage display (62-64), with the innovative proposal of a dual display system (65). The M13 phages utilized in phage display can be classified into different carriers, including 3 + 3, 6 + 6, and 8 + 8 types. Phage vectors are primarily categorized into type 3/8 and type 33/88 vectors based on the number of displayed exogenous peptides (66). Phage display technology, renowned for its remarkable specificity and sensitivity, finds extensive application in nano immunosensor development for toxin detection. This versatile tool excels in epitope mapping and identifying mimotopes for diverse antigens. In essence, phage display technology stands as a potent approach for crafting highly specific and sensitive nano immunosensors, revolutionizing cholera toxin detection in water sources. \n\nPhage display technology has revolutionized protein engineering and drug discovery. Among the most common type are random peptide libraries, showcasing millions of epitopes that aid in identifying specific binding peptides for various targets, including microorganisms, organ tissues, and nanoparticles (67). Biopanning enables the selection of peptides with high affinity and selectivity towards their targets (68). The advancement of cyclic peptides has further bolstered the technology, yielding peptides with enhanced stability and bioactivity.\n\n## Summary\nThus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection. \n\nIn practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation.

The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [116][117][118] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [119].\n\nAntibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery \"missiles\" for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [120]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [121]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [99,122]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37\u00b0C [123]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [99,124].\n\nThe identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [125][126][127]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [128]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogeninfected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [129]",

Liu, Chi-Chiu Lee, Han-zen Tsai, Hsin-Jung Li, Han\u2010Chung Wu\n## Abstract\nIt has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.\n## Affinity selection of human antibodies\nand then identifying the corresponding target antigens [114,115]. The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [116][117][118] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [119].\n\nAntibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery \"missiles\" for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [120]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [121]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [99,122]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37\u00b0C [123]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [99,124].\n\nThe identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [125][126][127]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [128]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogeninfected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [129]",

Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

It enables comprehensive analysis of individual antibody profiles. This technology shows great potential, particularly in exploring disease mechanisms and immune responses. Currently, PhIP-Seq has been successfully applied in various fields, such as the exploration of biomarkers for autoimmune diseases, vaccine development, and allergen detection. A variety of bioinformatics tools have facilitated the development of this process. However, PhIP-Seq technology still faces many challenges and has room for improvement. Here, we review the methods, applications, and challenges of PhIP-Seq and discuss its future directions in immunological research and clinical applications. With continuous progress and optimization, PhIP-Seq is expected to play an even more important role in future biomedical research, providing new ideas and methods for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n## Introduction\nThe importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

We have used a random peptide phage display (PD) library for selections against the monoclonal antibody anti-PGL-I. After three selection cycles, six peptides were identified. All sequences were interspersed by a spacer generating a chimeric peptide (PGLI-M3) that was artificially synthesized. The highly reactive peptide was submitted to a reverse PD selection with a single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment combinatorial library. The most reactive scFv was then validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against both native PGL-I and two derived synthetic (NDO and ND-O-HSA). We have further proved the scFv specificity by detecting M. leprae bacilli in leprosy lesions through immunohistochemistry. We then described its applicability in ELISA for all clinical forms and household contacts (HC). Afterward, we showed differential binding affinities of PGLI-M3 to sera (anti-PGL-I IgM) from all leprosy clinical forms through surface plasmon resonance (SPR). ELISA IgM detection showed 89.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity, considering all clinical forms. Positivity for anti-PGL-I IgM was twofold higher in both HC and patients with paucibacillary forms in hyperendemic regions than in endemic ones.

Kierny, T. D. Cunningham, B. Kay\n## Abstract\nThe utility of biomarker detection in tomorrow's personalized health care field will mean early and accurate diagnosis of many types of human physiological conditions and diseases. Michael Kierny and Thomas Cunningham contributed equally In the search for biomarkers, recombinant affinity reagents can be generated to candidate proteins or post-translational modifications that differ qualitatively or quantitatively between normal and diseased tissues. The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

For example, from the repertoire of B cells of patients who recovered from influenza virus infections or who received vaccination, it was possible to isolate, by Phage Display, several antibodies with the neutralization property of different influenza virus subtypes. Another example of antibody-based immunotherapy developed by Phage Display involves the identification of antibodies specific to different types of coronavirus.

Antibodies can interfere with virus infection by various mechanisms. The primary mechanism is by targeting the virus surface proteins; antibodies can inhibit virus attachment to cell surface receptors. Another main mechanism is targeting non-receptor-binding regions, such as in endosomal membrane fusion step where neutralization can occur by interfering virus conformational changes.

These new nanomaterials, called the \u201clandscape phage\u201d, serve as a huge resource of diagnostic/detection probes and versatile construction materials for the preparation of phage-functionalized biosensors and phage-targeted nanomedicines. Landscape-phage-derived probes interact with biological threat agents and generate detectable signals as a part of robust and inexpensive molecular recognition interfaces introduced in mobile detection devices. The use of landscape-phage-based interfaces may greatly improve the sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and longevity of these devices. In another area of bioengineering, landscape-phage technology has facilitated the development and testing of targeted nanomedicines. The development of high-throughput phage selection methods resulted in the discovery of a variety of cancer cell-associated phages and phage proteins demonstrating natural proficiency to self-assemble into various drug- and gene-targeting nanovehicles. The application of this new \u201cphage-programmed-nanomedicines\u201d concept led to the development of a number of cancer cell-targeting nanomedicine platforms, which demonstrated anticancer efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This review was prepared to attract the attention of chemical scientists and bioengineers seeking to develop functionalized nanomaterials and use them in different areas of bioscience, medicine, and engineering.",

                    "text": "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring [20,21,49,52,57]. It was proved that the landscape libraries represent an inexhaustible rich source of substitute antibodies-filaments that bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity [49]. Landscape-phage-based interfaces performed in many ways much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts in the same detector platforms. Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58,59]. In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected [60]. To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation [61]. After titering of the phage in the host E. coli strain, random phage clones were used for the identification of selected displayed peptides by sequencing of recombinant gpVIII DNA [61].",

Petrenko\n## Abstract\nThe development of phage engineering technology has led to the construction of a novel type of phage display library\u2014a collection of nanofiber materials with diverse molecular landscapes accommodated on the surface of phage particles. These new nanomaterials, called the \u201clandscape phage\u201d, serve as a huge resource of diagnostic/detection probes and versatile construction materials for the preparation of phage-functionalized biosensors and phage-targeted nanomedicines. Landscape-phage-derived probes interact with biological threat agents and generate detectable signals as a part of robust and inexpensive molecular recognition interfaces introduced in mobile detection devices. The use of landscape-phage-based interfaces may greatly improve the sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and longevity of these devices. In another area of bioengineering, landscape-phage technology has facilitated the development and testing of targeted nanomedicines. The development of high-throughput phage selection methods resulted in the discovery of a variety of cancer cell-associated phages and phage proteins demonstrating natural proficiency to self-assemble into various drug- and gene-targeting nanovehicles. The application of this new \u201cphage-programmed-nanomedicines\u201d concept led to the development of a number of cancer cell-targeting nanomedicine platforms, which demonstrated anticancer efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This review was prepared to attract the attention of chemical scientists and bioengineers seeking to develop functionalized nanomaterials and use them in different areas of bioscience, medicine, and engineering.\n## Landscape-Phage-Based Biosensors for Detection Monitoring of Biological Threats\nMedical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring [20,21,49,52,57]. It was proved that the landscape libraries represent an inexhaustible rich source of substitute antibodies-filaments that bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity [49]. Landscape-phage-based interfaces performed in many ways much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts in the same detector platforms. Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58,59]. In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected [60]. To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation [61]. After titering of the phage in the host E. coli strain, random phage clones were used for the identification of selected displayed peptides by sequencing of recombinant gpVIII DNA [61].",

Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens. A comprehensive review describing the progress in the preparation and use of recombinant phage-displayed antibodies for bioanalytical applications was published recently by Guliy et al. [30]. PSA is a serum marker that is commonly used for the diagnosis of prostatic diseases.",

Therefore, the current trend in the detection of PC is the development of portable biosensors for mobile laboratories and individual use. Phage display, since its conception by George Smith in 1985, has emerged as a premier tool in molecular biology with widespread application. This review describes the role of the molecular evolution and phage display paradigm in revolutionizing the methods for the early diagnosis and monitoring of PC.\n## Selection of PC Cell Binders from p3-Type Phage-Displayed Antibody Libraries\nThe polyclonal antibodies purified from the serum of an immunized animal (mouse, rabbit, goat, lama, etc.) and mAb secreted by immortalized B cells from the spleen of an immunized animal are commonly used in immunological assays. Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens. A comprehensive review describing the progress in the preparation and use of recombinant phage-displayed antibodies for bioanalytical applications was published recently by Guliy et al. [30]. PSA is a serum marker that is commonly used for the diagnosis of prostatic diseases.",

Chen, Chao-Ping Tung, Hung-Pin Peng, J. Jian, Yi-Kai Chiu, Yueh-Liang Tsou, Hong-Sen Chen, Yi-Jen Huang, W. Hsiao, Y. Wang, A. Yang\n## Abstract\nImmunoassays based on sandwich immuno-complexes of capture and detection antibodies simultaneously binding to the target analytes have been powerful technologies in molecular analyses. Recent developments in single molecule detection technologies enable the detection limit of the sandwich immunoassays approaching femtomolar (10\u201315 M), driving the needs of developing sensitive and specific antibodies for ever-increasingly broad applications in detecting and quantifying biomarkers. The key components underlying the sandwich immunoassays are antibody-based affinity reagents, for which the conventional sources are mono- or poly-clonal antibodies from immunized animals. The downsides of the animal-based antibodies as affinity reagents arise from the requirement of months of development timespan and limited choices of antibody candidates due to immunodominance of humoral immune responses in animals. Hence, developing animal antibodies capable of distinguishing highly related antigens could be challenging. To overcome the limitation imposed by the animal immune systems, we developed an in vitro methodology based on phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries for diverse antibodies as affinity reagents against closely related influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) subtypes, aiming to differentiating avian influenza virus (H5N1) from seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), for which the NPs are closely related by 90\u201394% in terms of pairwise amino acid sequence identity. We applied the methodology to attain, within four weeks, a panel of IgGs with distinguishable specificities against a group of representative NPs with pairwise amino acid sequence identities up to more than 90%, and the antibodies derived from the antibody libraries without further affinity refinement had comparable affinity of mouse antibodies to the NPs with the detection limit less than 1 nM of viral NP from lysed virus with sandwich ELISA. The panel of IgGs were capable of rapidly distinguishing infections due to virulent avian influenza virus from infections of seasonal flu, in responding to a probable emergency scenario where avian influenza virus would be transmissible among humans overlapping with the seasonal influenza infections. The results indicate that the in vitro antibody development methodology enables developing diagnostic antibodies that would not otherwise be available from animal-based antibody technologies.\n",

Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

Zambrano, G. Froechlich, D. Lazarevi\u0107, M. Passariello, A. Nicosia, C. De Lorenzo, M. Morelli, E. Sasso\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.\n## Introduction\nThe application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform. The NGS-based screening proved to be beneficial for isolating potentially therapeutic antibodies for both cancer immunotherapy [33], where novel clinically relevant targets continuously emerge, and for infectious diseases, especially for emergency or preparedness applications [37][38][39]. In this review, we summarize the NGS-based technologies applied to phage display and novel approaches to speed up the identification of large numbers of candidate binders, and to improve the yields of recombinant monoclonal antibodies.",

Eighty-five percent of new TB cases occur in resource-limited countries in Asia and Africa and fewer than 40% of TB cases are diagnosed due to the lack of accurate and easy-to-use diagnostic assays. Currently, diagnosis relies on the demonstration of the bacterium in clinical specimens by serial sputum smear microscopy and culture. These methods lack sensitivity, are time consuming, expensive, and require trained personnel. An alternative approach is to develop an efficient immunoassay to detect antibodies reactive to MTB antigens in bodily fluids, such as serum. Sarcoidosis and TB have clinical and pathological similarities and sarcoidosis tissue has yielded MTB components. Using sarcoidosis tissue, we developed a T7 phage cDNA library and constructed a microarray platform. We immunoscreened our microarray platform with sera from healthy (n = 45), smear positive TB (n = 24), and sarcoidosis (n = 107) subjects.

Talwar, S. Hanoudi, S. Dr\u0103ghici, L. Samavati\n## Abstract\nTuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and transmitted through inhalation of aerosolized droplets. Eighty-five percent of new TB cases occur in resource-limited countries in Asia and Africa and fewer than 40% of TB cases are diagnosed due to the lack of accurate and easy-to-use diagnostic assays. Currently, diagnosis relies on the demonstration of the bacterium in clinical specimens by serial sputum smear microscopy and culture. These methods lack sensitivity, are time consuming, expensive, and require trained personnel. An alternative approach is to develop an efficient immunoassay to detect antibodies reactive to MTB antigens in bodily fluids, such as serum. Sarcoidosis and TB have clinical and pathological similarities and sarcoidosis tissue has yielded MTB components. Using sarcoidosis tissue, we developed a T7 phage cDNA library and constructed a microarray platform. We immunoscreened our microarray platform with sera from healthy (n = 45), smear positive TB (n = 24), and sarcoidosis (n = 107) subjects. Using a student t-test, we identified 192 clones significantly differentially expressed between the three groups at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.01. Among those clones, we selected the top ten most significant clones and validated them on independent test set. The area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the top 10 significant clones was 1 with a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 1. Sequence analyses of informative phage inserts recognized as antigens by active TB sera may identify immunogenic antigens that could be used to develop therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines, as well as identify molecular targets for therapy.\n## Discussion\n[18][19][20].\n\nThere are various applications of a phage display. In the current work, we used a phage display for the discovery of TB biomarkers. The same system can be applied to identify novel markers for multi-drug resistance in TB, which is becoming a major issue in TB treatment. Additionally, phage displays can be used for the development of specific targeted therapies [42].

            "text": "Originally driven by the study of ligand-receptor interactions, phage display has evolved into a versatile platform encompassing a range of diagnostic methodologies. This technology has enabled the development of phage ELISA for antibody detection, biosensors for rapid pathogen identification, and peptide arrays for comprehensive biomarker screening [180]. The inherent signal amplification capacity of phages enhances their in situ detection and facilitates the identification of disease-specific bacterial markers. Moreover, phage-derived proteins hold promise for imaging and targeted drug delivery, thus advancing diagnostics and personalized medicine [181]. This adaptable tool fuels innovative strategies for disease detection and the exploration of biomarkers. Once engineered, these modified phages are useful in diverse diagnostic applications, offering sensitive and precise detection of disease-related entities in clinical samples, ranging from minute targets such as viruses to substantial entities such as cancer cells (Table 1) [182][183][184][185][186]. \n\nAnand et al. comprehensively outlined the application of phage displays for diagnosing coronaviruses [187]. Phage engineering has facilitated novel target exploration through epitope mapping, shedding light on interactions between coronaviruses, human cell receptors, and other molecules. Li et al. developed a method for detecting virus particles at levels lower than the minimum infective dose, such as 10 5 copies/mL [188]. Similarly, Soendergaard et al. identified an optimal peptide for ovarian cancer diagnosis, enabling the direct application of radioactive indium ( 111 In) labeling for conventional SPECT/CT instrumentation [189]. The use of M13 phages as detection probes provides an additional diagnostic avenue. Ferreira et al. employed an M13 phage display platform to visualize colorectal cancer cells via specific MCT1 marker binding [190]. Lee et al. encoded a lungcancer-targeting peptide, Pep-1, on M13 phages, enabling non-invasive live in vivo imaging with a near-infrared microscope [191]. Salles et al. ingeniously mimicked a Leishmania infantum epitope using an M13 phage display, achieving 100% specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing human visceral leishmaniasis [192].",

The in vivo production of antibodies by B-cells involves a series of intricate gene editing processes resulting in a highly diverse pool of antibodies. However, this diversity can be replicated in vitro using phage display. Phage display offers the potential to present the antibody phenotype together with the cloned genotype of the specific antibody in a single-phage particle. Antibodies are highly sought after for diagnostic applications owing to its specificity and affinity towards a target antigen. The advent of recombinant antibody (rAb) technology allows for a faster and more costeffective solution for antibody generation. It also provides diagnostic developers with the possibility to customize the antibodies. Antibodies have been utilized successfully in various diagnostic platforms ranging from standard immunoassays to lateral-flow assays, nanoparticles, microfluidics, DNA\u2010integrated assays and others. The limitless application of antibodies in the field of diagnostics has made it a critical component in any diagnostic development platform. This chapter focuses on the processes involved in antibody discovery including the various forms of antibody libraries for phage display and panning processes.

On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen.

This methodology enables the identification of peptides or proteins that have a high affinity for the intended targets. It can be used for purposes such as identifying potential drug candidates, understanding protein-protein interactions, studying immune responses and developing diagnostic assays. By harnessing the power of phage display, researchers can expedite the process of discovering molecules with desired properties, leading to advancements in various fields including medicine, biotechnology and molecular research [15,16]. Indeed, a growing body of evidence highlights the successful application of phage-based assays for the detection of bacteria in diverse settings, including clinical specimens, food samples, and environmental samples. These innovative assays leverage the specific interactions between phages and their target bacteria, offering rapid and accurate detection methods. In clinical contexts, phage-based assays have been utilized to detect various bacterial pathogens in patient samples, enabling early and precise diagnosis. Similarly, in the realm of food safety, these assays have been employed to identify harmful bacteria in food products, contributing to enhanced quality control and public health protection. Furthermore, the application of phage-based assays in environmental monitoring has allowed for the detection of bacteria in water, soil, and other ecological samples, aiding in the surveillance of potential contaminants. These successful demonstrations underscore the potential of phage-based assays as versatile tools with broad-ranging applications, offering valuable solutions for various sectors concerned with bacterial detection and identification [17][18][19]. Figure 1 provides an overview of the various phage-based biosensors that have been developed for bacterial detection using different analytical approaches. These biosensors leverage whole phage particles or their encoded proteins to effectively screen for the presence of bacteria. Phage-based diagnostics encompass a range of techniques, including phage capture elements, phage labeling, reporter phages and phage amplification. These approaches offer the potential for rapid and highly sensitive bacterial detection.

            "text": "The polyclonal antibodies purified from the serum of an immunized animal (mouse, rabbit, goat, lama, etc.) and mAb secreted by immortalized B cells from the spleen of an immunized animal are commonly used in immunological assays. Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens. A comprehensive review describing the progress in the preparation and use of recombinant phage-displayed antibodies for bioanalytical applications was published recently by Guliy et al. [30]. PSA is a serum marker that is commonly used for the diagnosis of prostatic diseases.",

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

The use of phage display for the selection of antigens from genomic or cDNA libraries of pathogens which is an alternative to the classical way of identifying immunogenic proteins is not well-known. In recent years several new applications for oligopeptide phage display in disease related fields have been developed which has led to the identification of various new antigens. These novel identified immunogenic proteins provide new insights into host pathogen interactions and can be used for the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. In this review we focus on the M13 oligopeptide phage display system for pathogen research but will also give examples for lambda phage display and for applications in other disease related fields. In addition, a detailed technical work flow for the identification of immunogenic oligopeptides using the pHORF system is given. The described identification of immunogenic proteins of pathogens using oligopeptide phage display can be linked to antibody phage display resulting in a vaccine pipeline.",

            "text": "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring [20,21,49,52,57]. It was proved that the landscape libraries represent an inexhaustible rich source of substitute antibodies-filaments that bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity [49]. Landscape-phage-based interfaces performed in many ways much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts in the same detector platforms. Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58,59]. In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected [60]. To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation [61]. After titering of the phage in the host E. coli strain, random phage clones were used for the identification of selected displayed peptides by sequencing of recombinant gpVIII DNA [61].",

            "text": "However, these methods that claim high sensitivity also require greater technical skills as well as expensive instrumentation. In such a scenario, rapid identification methods using simple immunological assays for laboratory use, such as ELISA, and field portable biosensors could be more useful. \n\nIn general all antibody detection assays are based on whole antigens with multiple epitopes, which show greater sensitivity, but cross-reactions are often observed. On the other hand, epitopespecific antibody response assays are not commonly used, because it is well established that genetic background can influence the specificity of B-cell responses [13]; therefore, simple epitopes are rarely used as markers because of the difficulty in selecting common motifs that recognize broad immune responses of animals. However, the development of novel epitopes through Phage Display (PD) technology [14] has become possible, especially because selected mimotopes that mimic natural antigenic determinants are mainly originated from dominant responses, and selection favors highly reactive motifs, due to their optimized structure or functional properties [15]. Importantly, selected stable short peptide sequences assessed for tight binding to antibodies, receptors or proteins may present potential applications in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines [16,17]. \n\nBecause of the importance of the carrier animal in disease transmission, and also due to the difficulty in producing total purified antigens from infected erythrocyte cultures, an effective diagnostic test with synthetic peptides may be an interesting alternative tool to reduce disease transmission and economic losses. Therefore, in this present study, we have selected peptides through PD against a monoclonal antibody that targets the major surface protein 1a (MSP1a) in order to map its epitope and to develop new mimotopes that are more effective than the native epitope in detecting antibody responses in cattle against A. marginale. We have also proposed a bioeletrode conjugated to the epitope to detect antibodies in crude serum by electrochemistry, which may become the basis of novel biosensors based on a specific-epitope antibody response detection that can be used in field conditions due to its flexibility, easiness, fastness, and low cost.",

            "text": "The polyclonal antibodies purified from the serum of an immunized animal (mouse, rabbit, goat, lama, etc.) and mAb secreted by immortalized B cells from the spleen of an immunized animal are commonly used in immunological assays. Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens.

            "text": "Thus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection. \n\nIn practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is a versatile, reproducible, and functional technology that can be utilized to isolate antibody candidates for numerous disease indications. While it is the most common and well-established form of display technologies, the success of isolating useful antibodies is highly dependent on the quality and the nature of the targeted antigen used in biopanning and the size and quality of the library. By performing cell-based biopanning, antibody phage display can be used to identify new cell biomarkers, isolate antibodies that can discriminate between different antigen epitopes and conformations, or identify antibodies against antigens that are not available in pure form (74). \n\nPhage display technology has been proven to be a powerful human mAb discovery platform. Not long ago the commercial use of phage display was restricted to a few selected biopharmaceutical companies with rights to phage display intellectual property (569). This explains why most of the approved mAbs or those in clinical trials sourced from phage display libraries belong to commercial entities with rights to the technology. However, most of the key patents covering phage display technology have expired in Europe and the US (569). Consequently, patent expiration should encourage academic and biotech start-ups to develop their own libraries to generate and develop more antibodies for translation to the clinic. \n\nBy reflecting on the collected data, antibody phage display has contributed to the isolation of antibodies for the treatment of many disease indications. There are 14 FDA approved phage display-derived antibodies and antibody fragments, and many others in clinical trials. Many research institutes, start-ups and industrial laboratories are continually developing methods for the design, construction and screening of developable antibodyphage libraries. Further improvements are expected to be achieved in the near future as this technology contributes significantly toward research, diagnosis, and therapy.",

One of the major drawbacks of using phage in diagnostic assays is the aspecific adsorption of proteins leading to a high background signal and decreasing sensitivity. To deal with this, we developed a genetically pure, exchangeable dual-display phage system in which biomarkers and streptavidin-binding protein (SBP) are displayed at opposite ends of the phage. This approach allows for sample purification, using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads resulting in a higher sensitivity of signal detection assays. Our dual-display cassette system approach also allows for easy exchange of both the anchor protein (SBP) and the displayed biomarker. The presented principle is applied for the detection of antibody reactivity against UH-RA.21 which is a good candidate biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The applicability of dual-display phage preparation using a helper plasmid system is demonstrated, and its increased sensitivity in phage ELISA assays using patient serum samples is shown.",

            "text": "Numerous studies indicate that no single marker can completely identify and differentiate the cancer groups from healthy controls. However, a combination of multiple markers may provide a promising way for the early detection of cancer. On the other hand, the multifactorial and multistep nature of the molecular pathogenesis of human cancer can also be considered in the design and interpretation of studies to identify biomarkers useful for the early detection of cancer. \n\nOur previous studies showed that combinations of multiple antigen-antibody systems might acquire higher sensitivity for diagnosis of cancer [13,18]. Wang et al. used a phage display library derived from prostate cancer tissue to develop a phage protein microarray for the analysis of autoantibodies in serum samples from 119 patients with prostate cancer and 138 individuals with no history of prostate cancer [19]. In this study, a 22-phage-peptide detector was constructed for prostate-cancer screening, with 81.6% sensitivity and 88.2% specificity. These studies strongly support the hypothesis that \"customized\" TAA arrays enhance autoantibody detection in cancer and constitute promising and powerful tools for the immunoserological diagnosis of certain cancer. \n\nIn the present study, eight TAAs were used as coating antigens in 304 sera from patients with different types of cancer and 58 sera from normal individuals. With the successive addition of TAAs to a final combination of total eight antigens, the sensitivity in detecting autoantibody in any type of cancer increased from 20% to 26% when one antigen was used, while it ranged from 56% to 66% when eight antigens were used. In the combined cancer group, positive predictive value was 96.0%. It indicated that parallel assay of eight TAAs raised the diagnostic quality greatly. In addition, positive likelihood ratio was 4.60, which showed that the clinical diagnostic value of parallel assay of eight TAAs was high, and Kappa value was 0.51, which indicated the observed value of this assay had middle range of coincidence with actual value. \n\nOur aim is to increase the sensitivity and specificity of anti-TAA antibodies as diagnostic markers in cancer detection by expanding the TAA array, including TAAs which may be more selectively associated with one specific type of cancer and not with others.",

            "text": "Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Igs), are proteins produced by the adaptive immune system that play a crucial role in providing defense against pathogens and foreign substances. Antibodies can recognize and bind to pathogens and foreign substances called antigens in the body, neutralizing them and marking them for destruction by other immune cells (Sun et al., 2020). The unique antibody profile of each individual holds significant biological information including details about environmental exposures, allergic reactions, autoimmune disease processes, and responses to immunomodulatory therapies. This detailed information can be critical for understanding an individual's immune status, diagnosing a variety of diseases, and guiding therapeutic interventions. \n\nTraditional antibody binding assays, such as ELISA, have been a cornerstone in the field of immunology, providing critical insights into the recognition and response to various antigens. Western Blot (WB), also known as immunoblotting (Renart et al., 1979) is used to detect and semiquantify target proteins, making it a commonly used technique for antibody validation (Sule et al., 2023). However, traditional methods can only assess antibodies against a limited number of antigens. This limitation also hinders the determination of an individual's full antibody profile and the identification of novel or uncharacterized antigens (Mohan et al., 2018). Moreover, the protein expression and purification involved in these tests can be laborious and resource-intensive, particularly for complex or poorly characterized antigens. \n\nBacteriophages are the most abundant and diverse class of viruses in the world, renowned for their simple construction and easy manipulation, making them ideal model organisms for biological research. In 1985, Professor George Smith invented phage display for studying antibody-peptide interactions (Smith, 1985). The coding sequences of target proteins or peptides are inserted into the phage vectors, allowing them to be displayed or presented on the surface of phage particles. The importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018.",

            "text": "Igs, generally referred to as antibodies, are large glycoproteins produced by white blood cells with strong affinity and specificity towards their target analytes. These qualities make them a natural and popular choice as biorecognition elements and consequently, have been adapted for use in pathogen identification. In addition to whole monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are laboratory made, antibody-derived single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab') units are commonly used for biorecognition [40]. They are more cost-effective than mAbs while providing similar specificity values as conventional antibody approaches. Antibody-based probes are most commonly used for the detection of specific proteins and whole cells [41]. Because numerous methods of pathogen identification using antibodies as biorecognition elements have been reported, this review provides only a brief overview of a few recent reported strategies. \n\nAntibodies are identified within the relevant biochemical pathways and then produced in animals and purified for various applications, including for use as capture probes in sensors platforms [9]. Most examples of antibody-based biosensors for detection of pathogens use commercially produced antibodies, as in the case of Park et al. [42] who developed a 3D printed microfluidic device with antibodies conjugated to MNPs (Ab-MNPs) as capture probes against the common pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7. The device, termed a magnetic pre-concentrator (3D\u00b5FMP) was tested using human blood mixed with 10 2 -10 7 colony forming units (CFU) of E. coli O157:H7 and Ab-MNPs (10 13 particles/mL). The mixture was treated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) eliminating reagent before being injected into the 3D\u00b5FMP device. Captured cells were then magnetically separated and quantified using an ATP luminescence assay achieving an excellent limit of detection (LOD) of 10 CFU/mL in blood. The 3D\u00b5FMP device was efficient, selectively enriching E. coli O157:H7 700-fold in a volume of 100 mL in one hour.",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The analysis of the literature data shows the good prospects of using phage-display methods for the design of analytical tools for the early detection of cancer, specifically prostate cancer. Traditionally, phage-display methods have been used for the discovery and improvement of antibodies, and their antigen-binding fragments are widely used in numerous immunochemical detection devices. Considering the huge public interest in this area of research and development [76], one can expect the further development of antibody phage display technology to improve the performance of modern detection methods. Furthermore, the tremendous success in the development of novel analytical methods for the fast, inexpensive detection of SARS viruses using novel analytical platforms and sensing materials during the COVID pandemic promoted the development of new approaches for the construction of novel biosensor platforms for the mass screening of humans for early signs of cancer. In this contest, the landscape phages described here appear competitive in comparison with novel interfaces and diagnostic probes [16]. For example, the model-phage-based electrochemical and ELISA immunosensors showed comparable limits of detection to most advanced antibody-, aptamer-, and Au-based biosensors. In contrast to other interfaces, the phage structure is extraordinarily robust, being resistant to heat, organic solvents, urea, acid, and alkali, and can tolerate different modifications that increase the efficacy of their use as detection and diagnostic probes [124]. For example, the conjugation of a phage with gold nanoparticles is a straightforward, reliable process [62], which can be easily adapted for the construction of different types of lateral flow immunoassays for point-of-care prostate-specific antigen testing [16]. Purified phages can be stored indefinitely at moderate temperatures without losing their infectivity and binding activity [46,125,126]. An important advantageous characteristic of landscape phages is their availability for safe, large-scale production, and their use in prostate cancer control, as recently reviewed [16,[127][128][129]. \n\nFunding: The effort of the Author in writing the Review was supported by Auburn University.",

            "text": "detection. Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.",

            "text": "In diagnostic sectors an immense demand has been raised to discover disease-related biomarkers. The most commonly used bioreceptors are antibodies, nucleic acids, proteins, whole cells, or microorganisms. Recently, bacteriophages have emerged as versatile bioreceptors in the development of diagnostic biosensors due to their high thermal and chemical stability and robustness. [1][2][3] The phage can be directly used as a probe when they are modified to display disease-related antigens on its surface. 4 The phage production is also cost-effective, and they can be produced in sufficient numbers by just infecting a bacterial host. The phage could be used to display different types of peptides, proteins, and antibodies to be employed in affinity selection of target-specific phage particles. 1,2,[5][6][7][8] Current advances in biosensors are providing the possibility for immobilizing bioreceptor molecules in a site-directed pattern while retaining their intact Dovepress Dovepress 5238 rajaram et al structure and native biological function. 9 As recently reported, the oriented immobilization of bacteriophages on a sensing platform resulted in a higher sensitivity in the detection of autoantibodies in serum samples. 6 A main drawback of bacteriophages-based diagnostic assays is the nonspecific adsorption of proteins, leading to a high background signal and decreasing sensitivity. Due to the lack of a specific strategy to bring the phage onto a sensing platform, most of the phage-based assays are limited to an ELISA format. 10 However, if complex substances, such as serum, are used to screen for targets, phage ELISA lacks sensitivity due to nonspecific binding of interfering serum components. 11 To overcome this problem, we designed a dual-display phage system including an autoantigenic target UH-RA.21 as a biomarker and streptavidin (STV)-binding protein (SBP) as capturing peptide, both being displayed at opposite ends of a filamentous phage. 12 This approach resulted in a higher sensitivity of signal detection assays using STV-coated magnetic beads.

            "text": "The antibody-antigen relationship is widely studied due to its importance in immune defense, diagnostic tools, vaccination, therapeutics, and fundamental research in immunology, microbiology, and molecular biology. This relationship has vast implications across many therapeutic and diagnostic fields, including its importance for analyte detection and its significance at the center of how the immune system identifies and responds to pathogens. Antibody-antigen research has been driven by both natural immune recognition mechanisms, like the immune system's response to infection, and synthetic methods, such as phage display techniques for large-scale production of diverse sets of antibody fragments, to identify structures and their interactions within the antibody-antigen relationship. Through improved understanding of the antibody-antigen relationship, antibody specificity and affinity has been refined for applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Advancements in screening methods, including phage libraries, DNA recombination, or hybridoma technologies have allowed for the diverse and rapid isolation of antibodies for clinical use [11,12]. The range of specificity and affinity from these techniques has contributed to the growth and development of disease-specific diagnostic tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, radioimmunoassay (RIA), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), among others. Moreover, improvements to antibody screening and development techniques have allowed for increased understanding of antibody-antigen interactions. In addition to our ability to determine the specificity of antibodies, the ability to determine their sensitivity and functional components is crucial for clinical use. Emerging techniques, such as microfluidics, pose additional possibilities for the future research and development of antibody-antigen interactions. These advancements are evident in the increased use of monoclonal antibodies and the widespread availability of both onsite and at-home diagnostic tests.",

            "text": "Therefore, coat proteins pVIII and pIII are commonly used for protein display because those genes contain N-terminal periplasm-directing signal sequences. By introducing such a signal sequence between the N-terminus of pVII or pIX and the cDNA of the protein of interest, it becomes possible to develop a stable display system using those coat proteins as well (Georgieva and Konthur 2012;Loset and Sandlie 2012). There is a persisting demand for suitable disease-related biomarkers as indicators for diseases, like proteins, peptides, metabolites, and antibodies (Vithayathil et al. 2011). The capability to display diseasespecific proteins on a phage surface could be a big advantage in the field of diagnostics. Phage can be directly used as a probe when it is modified to display disease-related antigens on its surface (Kierny et al. 2012). Also, problems associated with synthesizing small molecules can be overcome by PD (Dudak et al. 2011). This would involve the phage in the development of diagnostic biosensors, functioning as a receptor, attached to an electrode or transducer surface. Increasing attention has been drawn towards the use of phage as a receptor molecule in different applications, due to its inherent stability and resistance to denaturation in unfavorable conditions, unlike DNA and antibodies. It can sustain higher temperatures of up to 70 \u00b0C and pH variations from 2.5 to 12 (Arap 2005;Mao et al. 2009). \n\nPhage production is also cost-effective, in contrast to the production of monoclonal antibodies. They can be produced in sufficient numbers by just infecting a bacterial host. Phagebased assays are mostly performed in an ELISA format; however, if complex substances such as serum are used in detecting targets, this approach lacks sensitivity due to aspecific binding of interfering serum components increasing the background signal. The same problem can be expected in the abovementioned biosensor setups. Therefore, sample preparation should also be taken into account when setting up such assays. \n\nThe design of a dual-display system, where phage displays both a biomarker and a capturing protein, allows for such a sample preparation.",

(2024) 19 (9), 811-824 ISSN 1746-0913 811 10.2217/fmb-2023-0246 C 2024 The Authors routes, including water, food, air and clinical settings. Phage therapeutics has emerged as a highly debated and explored topic, with the fundamental understanding of phage biology, its life cycle, and interactions with host bacteria shedding light on its potential as a bio-probe or assay [7,8]. This potential holds promise in addressing persistent challenges associated with infections, whether they are foodborne, airborne, waterborne or clinical in nature. The inherent qualities of phages, such as their self-replicating ability and host-specific nature, position them as a valuable tool in combating these infectious threats [9,10]. Phage-based diagnostics offer a captivating aspect of achieving unparalleled levels of specificity and sensitivity while minimizing both cost and time requirements. The ingenious utilization of the phage display technique further enhances the diagnostic potential [11]. This technique involves the incorporation of a protein of interest into the phage coat protein, resulting in the external display of the protein. This connection between genotype and phenotype showcases the fusion of genetic information with observable characteristics. By exploiting this technique, phage-based diagnostics can leverage the unique properties of phages to precisely target and identify specific pathogens or molecules of interest [11,12]. This approach promises to revolutionize the field of diagnostics by providing a powerful tool that combines the advantages of phage biology with the precision of molecular recognition, ultimately enhancing our ability to detect and diagnose a wide range of infections and diseases [13]. Phage display platforms offer a versatile approach for screening phages against a variety of DNA sequences, peptides and proteins [10,14]. This technique involves the presentation of diverse peptides or proteins on the surface of phages, which can then be subjected to interactions with specific target entities. By measuring the interactions between these displayed proteins and the desired targets, researchers can gain valuable insights into molecular binding, recognition, and potential applications.",

            "text": "After surgical resection of pancreatic tumors, there is a high risk of tumor recurrence. Phage display technology can be used to identify peptides that bind specifically to residual cancer cells or tumorassociated biomarkers in blood or other bodily fluids, enabling early detection of recurrent disease. Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis mainly due to the delayed diagnosis of the disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is crucial, especially with the advent of disease-modifying therapies. Blood-based tests for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer offer a cheaper, less invasive, and more accessible alternative. Phage display technology has been utilized to screen for functional peptides or antibodies from the blood of pancreatic cancer patients and healthy individuals to develop blood-based biomarker detection tests based on these phage-derived peptides (Figure 8). This approach has provided new insights into the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, new biomarkers for pancreatic cancer diagnosis, such as microRNA (Zhang W. et al., 2022), have been emerging in recent years. Phage display technologies can be used to develop high-affinity, high-sensitivity probes that can be combined with various biosensors for rapid blood testing, showing great potential in the development of more effective diagnostic tools for pancreatic cancer.",

            "text": "A recent meta-analysis [11] concluded that assays based on multiple antigens provided higher sensitivities and specificities than single antigen assays, with 38 kDa, Ag85B, a-crystallin and MPT51 being most effective [12]. An intrinsic problem with this approach is the variability in individual immune responses, differences in disease stages, and the time taken to develop an antibody response. Furthermore, antibody presence is not always indicative of an active TB infection. The second approach involves direct detection of the antigens themselves, rather than the antibodies that recognize them. Many have been assessed [13], with the detection of antigen 85 (Ag85) components directly in serum [14,15] being particularly diagnostic. \n\nAg85 comprises three related (71-77% homology) proteins of 30-32 kDa each: Ag85A, Ag85B, Ag85C [16], that are the most abundantly secreted M. tuberculosis proteins in vitro [17]. Ag85 and Ag85 RNA have been explored as potential biomarkers for TB in urine [18] and sera [14], with high sensitivity and specificity using indirect ELISA. Using commercially available antibodies on a waveguide biosensor platform we obtained a 500 fM limit of detection for Ag85. However, the application of this assay to clinical samples was prevented by poor antibody stability (Mukundan H. et al, Tuberculosis, in press, 2012), prompting the present study to develop antibodies for this significant biomarker. \n\nImmunological reagents used for infectious diagnosis typically comprise poly-or monoclonal antibodies from immunized animals. Recently antibodies have been developed using in vitro methods [19,20]. In phage display, antibodies of interest can be selected from large phage antibody libraries in only a few days, rather than the months required for immunization approaches. Yeast display has recently emerged as an alternative strategy, with one significant advantage over phage display: the ability to accurately control selection parameters by flow cytometry [21]. \n\nIn the present work, we take advantage of both selection approaches to isolate numerous single chain Fvs (scFvs) recognizing Ag85.",

            "text": "Detection of antibodies against infectious agents is an important part of basic and clinical research. For clinical diagnosis, the detection of antibody responses to some pathogens provides a sensitive assay for current, as well as past, infections. Antibody responses are also used to evaluate specific clinical symptoms associated with some pathogens. In vaccine research, antibody titers to specific proteins of an infectious agent often correlate strongly with the extent of protection afforded by the vaccine. Identifying protective B-cell responses against antigens, particularly against conformational epitopes that provide broad-spectrum protection against a given infection, are also critical for vaccine development and monitoring. The identification of antigens that induce the most effective immune response and which are the most diagnostically useful can be a daunting task. Improved approaches to increase both the spectrum of antigens tested and the quality of humoral responses detected has tremendous potential for many of these types of studies. \n\nAlthough routine detection of antibodies is generally performed one antigen at a time by ELISA, there is increasing interest in studying antibody responses to whole proteomes for some infectious agents. While the availability of full genomic DNA sequences to many infectious agents has provided a framework to systematically identify antigenic targets, significant challenges remain to study antibody responses to Analyses of humoral responses against different infectious agents are critical for infectious disease diagnostics, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and the development and monitoring of vaccines. While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers.",

Our platform adds a new tool to this arsenal for the extracellular detection of protein analytes. Additionally, our platform is unique in enabling analyte detection without requiring an active cell metabolism.\n\nThis contrasts with most previous solutions where the output signal is dependent on active cellular metabolism and/or gene expression for reporter protein production (Courbet et al. 2015;Daringer et al. 2014;Ostrov et al. 2017). Lastly, the platform can potentially offer large cost savings to assay manufacturers as the cells autonomously express and surface display nanobodies which removes the need for the costly steps of antibody production, purification and attachment to latex particles surface.\n\nThe design of our biological LAT is inherently modular and is readily extensible to the detection of other analytes of interest by exchanging the nanobody that is surface displayed through simple molecular cloning techniques. There are numerous developed nanobodies described in the literature (Harmsen and De Haard 2007). Alternatively, phage-display libraries can be used to select new nanobodies for different targets or to enhance specificity (Tanha et al. 2002;Verheesen et al. 2006)or immunization, e.g. of camels, llamas, or sharks, can be used to isolate new nanobodies if desired (van der Linden et al. 2000). Thus, the technology described here could be used as a platform for the development of a range of assays for different target analytes. For inherently multivalent targets, a nanobody that binds to a single epitope is all that is necessary to develop a new assay. Monomeric targets can be detected by mixing two cell populations expressing nanobodies that bind to different epitopes.\n\nAdditionally, we have shown that the dynamic range of this diagnostic platform can be easily tuned for the requirement of the particular application, and very low limits of detection are easily achievable.",

            "text": "Three main forms of ELISA assays are frequently used to detect pathogen-specific antibodies, i.e., indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA and capture ELISA [71]. Both indirect and sandwich ELISA formats are used to measure pathogen-specific IgA or IgG in convalescent disease (i.e., after infection and disease resolution), while capture ELISA is predominantly used to assess pathogen-specific IgM during acute infection and disease. Both ELISAs and RDTs are commonly conducted in LMICs as their implementation requires minimal equipment, resources and training. \n\nThe future of sero-diagnostics for surveillance and epidemiology are highly multiplexable technologies, i.e., experimental assays that can measure antibodies to numerous pathogens simultaneously. The most widely used multiplex serological platforms are the fluorescent bead-based assays and the microarray-based assays [72][73][74]. Both bead-based (such as Luminex immunoassays) and immune microarrays based serological assays can be conducted with small sample quantities and allow for multiplexing from tens to hundreds of pathogens. Due to high cost, bead and microarray-based multiplex serology assays are less accessible to low resource settings than ELISA techniques. \n\nThe newest cutting-edge multiplex serology assay with the potential to revolutionize sero-surveillance of infectious diseases is the phage-immunoprecipitation assay (PhIP-Seq) [41,75]. The PhIP-Seq technology allows serology to be \"megaplexed\", i.e., the detection of up to a million different pathogen proteins. This assay has already been successfully run with various antibody-containing biological samples and used to study sero-prevalence of viruses and bacteria [76,77]. PhIP-Seq combines serology testing with next generation sequencing (NGS) for antibody detection. Unfortunately, molecular sequencing is currently too expensive to set up in low resource settings. Furthermore, PhIP-Seq requires trained personnel for both the experimental protocol and the subsequent bioinformatic analysis. However, as NGS and PhIP-Seq becomes more widespread in LMICs hopefully these financial and skill-based barriers can be overcome.",

A newer form of antibody detection assay overcomes these limitations by utilizing phage display for antigen expression and nucleic acid-barcodes for multiplexing. This newer antibody technology is known as phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). The concept of PhIP-Seq was initially introduced by Larman et al. in 2011 to detect autoantibodies and identify autoantigens in patients with paraneoplastic syndrome, a condition with an autoimmune etiology [9]. This technique leverages on more modern sequencing and nucleic acid synthesis abilities. Since then, its use has expanded to infectious disease applications including sero-epidemiology of common (e.g., measles) and emerging pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). In this review, we provide an introduction to the technology, with a focus on viral pathogens. We will also provide an overview of the current sero-epidemiological applications and identify future directions where PhIP-Seq's strengths can be capitalized.",

            "text": "However, PCR-based assays require expensive equipment, trained personnel, and a consistent power supply, making them unsuitable for on-site testing. Recently, several investigators have developed alternative methods, including MALDI-TOF MS [17,18], luminescent phage [19], gold nanoparticle (GNP) [20], and lateral-flow strip immunoassay (LFSA) [21] for K. pneumoniae detection. However, these methods also have drawbacks such as the need for sophisticated equipment (MALDI-TOF MS), the need for a relatively long incubation time (luminescent phage), and low sensitivity (GNP and LFSA). \n\nBiosensors are a sophisticated alternative to commonly used molecular bacterial detection methods, providing cost-effective, specific, sensitive, and in situ real-time monitoring with minimal sample preparation and detection time [22]. Biosensors are essentially made up of a recognition element coupled to a transducer that converts specific analyte binding to receptors into a detectable or measurable readout [23,24]. Therefore, developing biosensors with high sensitivity and specificity requires the design and use of recognition elements that specifically bind to the pathogen of interest. Although antibodies are the most commonly used recognition element in affinity biosensor research, their production and purification costs, as well as their stability during and after immobilization on sensor surfaces, are difficult to manage [24]. Short peptides derived from phage-displayed libraries have recently been introduced as an intriguing alternative for developing novel biosensing platforms. As opposed to antibodies, peptides are more stable and easier to manipulate at the molecular level, and they have a low manufacturing cost [25,26]. In fact, phage-displayed peptides have been successfully employed as molecular recognition elements for the detection of bacterial toxins [27] as well as the identification of Staphylococcus aureus [28,29], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [30], Salmonella typhimurium [31,32], and Bacillus anthracis [33].",

Currently, specific pathogen identification is achieved through available RT-PCR and antibody-based strategies. In the clinic, these tests are usually applied consecutively to evaluate for the presence of the most likely to least likely pathogen based on patient findings. An automated classification strategy that is less dependent on clinical knowledge but achieves rapid accurate identification of a single pathogen from among a group of possible pathogens is currently unavailable. \n\nOur previously described filament-based antibody recognition assay (FARA) employs antibodies immobilized at known locations along a filament to detect specific pathogens. 9,10 The filament is pulled through a series of small reaction chambers, and pathogens, if present, are captured by filament-bound antibodies. Detection of pathogen binding is achieved by using a fluorescently labeled second antibody specific for the pathogen. \n\nFARA was first reported using immobilized anti-M13K07 antibody to detect M13K07 phage. 10 This virus and antibody pair provided a well-characterized test system to demonstrate the feasibility of a filamentbased, pathogen-detection platform. However, in this first generation approach, the filaments were removed from the system for fluorescence scanning. Subsequent improvements to FARA include an integrated fluorescence detector and a feedback algorithm to control filament position. 9 The integrated detector enables adaptive pathogen detection in which regions of interest along the filament can be reincubated in the Address correspondence to Frederick R.

Though these standard detection methods are sensitive, they lag behind in terms of detection time, taking from several hours to days to yield a response (Velusamy et al. 2010). Conventional analytical techniques like optical, chromatographic and electrochemical detection are faster, but have some limitations of equipment and cost. Furthermore, they are complicated and require highly trained personnel and extensive sample preparation. These constraints do not always allow frequent, real time or in situ monitoring of food or clinical samples. Thus, demands of high sensitivity, specificity, costeffective, portable and rapid analyses have propelled the development of biosensors as novel diagnostic tools in the medical and food sectors. Many diagnostic tools still rely on immunoassays and especially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Besides these classical tests, several phage and aptamer based sensors have also been proposed for a broad range of disease biomarkers or carriers such as antibodies, viruses, disease-related proteins, tumour cells, toxins and pathogens, among several others. The precise detection of these biomarkers or carriers before the onset of a disease can significantly revolutionise the medical field by providing cheap, fast, simple and easily produced diagnostic tests using phages and aptamers as their recognition elements. The wide range of assays that employ phages or aptamers to detect important clinical molecules, highlights the potential of these new receptors in clinical diagnostic tests and in food biosensors. This chapter will define phages and aptamers and discuss their use as novel biorecognition elements in biosensors. We discuss two relevant cases in the field of biosensors: the use of diagnostics for clinical testing and the use of biosensors for food-related testing.",

We have opted to use luminescence modulating phages for the analysis of known acute inflammatory response biomarker CRP (C-reactive protein) and biomarkers of prostate cancer in urine samples. Firstly, CRP was used to simulate the detection process in a controlled chemical environment. Secondly, we tried to classify more challenging lethal prostate cancer samples from control samples. Our unique method utilizes a special biopanning process in order to create special phages capable of capturing a dye necessary for detection and potential biomarkers. As the biomarker-molecules interfere with the phages, dye is repelled from the phage network resulting in an altered reporter luminescence. These changes can be observed with an absorbance reader and even with the naked eye. The simple method could present an alternative for screening of disease biomarkers. For prostate cancer urine samples, we achieved a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75% to detect Grade Group (GG) 4 and 5 prostate cancer.",

            "text": "For diagnostic applications, whole phages and phage-derived proteins have been extensively explored [27]. According to Meile et al. (2020), phage-based pathogen recognition tools can be divided into two categories by their modes of action: infection-based and capture-based detection methods (Figure 2). In the present review, we focus on capturebased detection methods in which tail proteins are used as bio-sensing molecules to detect a particular bacterial strain. In the following, we describe the relevant methodologies that may be implemented for bacterial detection. \n\nWhole phage particles can be applied as bio-recognition elements through their specific binding to the host. This approach has been extensively explored in the development of biosensors. A biosensor can be defined as a detection device in which biomolecular interactions between a bioprobe and an analyte are translated into a measurable signal by means of transduction systems [28]. A typical biosensor consists of a surface functionalized with a biorecognition element, a transduction system that generates a signal reflecting the number of binding events, and an amplifier that processes the signal to give a readable output [29]. The bioprobe is arguably the most crucial element: it confers specificity and sensitivity, which are essential features of a reliable diagnostic tool. Various types of molecules have been used for this purpose, including nucleic acids [30], antibodies or antibody fragments [31,32], and both wild-type and engineered phages (reporter phages) [33]. Another group of potential bioprobes comprises phage-derived binders, such as RBP (described in more detail below) [34,35], endolysin cell wall-binding domains (CBD) [36][37][38], and phage-display peptides [39,40]. Details may be found in existing comprehensive reviews of biosensor transduction systems and their modes of action, e.g., [41]. In addition to surface-immobilized phages in biosensors, whole phage particles, conjugated with, e.g., magnetic nanobeads can also be used as capture probes in bacterial detection assays.",

            "text": "Serological identification of pathogen exposure can be assessed using a variety of either binding or functional antibody assays (Figure 1). Assays measuring functional properties of antibodies (such as those measuring virus neutralization, inhibition of virus binding to host receptor, antibody dependent complement killing of bacteria [61]) are frequently more pathogen-specific. In some contexts, functional antibody assays can even differentiate between viral serotypes or variants, such as in dengue virus [62] or with SARS-CoV-2 [63], respectively. For viruses, functional properties such as antibody neutralization are frequently assessed through experimental techniques using live virus (such as plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT), focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT), virus neutralization assay (VNT), fluorescent virus neutralization assay (FVNT)), inhibition of virus binding to host receptor (such as surrogate neutralization assay (sVNT)), or pseudovirus neutralization assay [64][65][66]. For bacteria, functional assays measuring antibody dependent killing of bacteria (such as bactericidal complement assay and bacterial phagocytosis assays) are more commonly used [67,68]. However, due to their time-consuming, expensive and low throughput nature, functional assays are not often used for surveillance purposes. \n\nExperimental platforms that measure pathogen-specific antibodies through binding to pathogen-specific antigens are more widely utilized for infectious disease sero-surveillance and sero-epidemiology studies. Traditional tools such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) and lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are commercially available for various pathogens and frequently used in hospital settings for quick diagnosis of infectious diseases [22,26,69]. There also exist modified versions of ELISA assays using various non-enzyme-linked detections, such as fluorescent probes and chelators (e.g., time-resolved immunofluorescent assays) [70]. Three main forms of ELISA assays are frequently used to detect pathogen-specific antibodies, i.e., indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA and capture ELISA [71].",

These molecular techniques are often more tedious and laborious than immunoassay-based methods and are typically only employed in a laboratory. Therefore, the phage-derived antibody fragments that can distinguish viable from dead foodborne pathogens can open a new horizon for more rapid and simpler diagnostics for food safety, which can be applied in different settings outside of the laboratory. We developed a lateral flow test strip using the selected phage as a biorecognition element for the detection of live Salmonella Enteritidis and proved the specificity of the assay for detecting Salmonella Enteritidis. In addition, although this phage clone was not previously screened against Staphylococcus aureus during the screening process, the test strips using this phage showed no cross-reactivity with S. aureus. The low intensity observed at the highest titer of Salmonella (1 \u00d7 10 10 CFU/mL) could be explained by the hook effect from excessively high antigen concentration in lateral flow immunoassays (Ross et al., 2020). Although sensitivities of the phage clone and antibody were around 10 6 CFU/mL by the PTA-ELISA method, the sensitivity for the phage-based lateral flow test strip was found to be 10 7 CFU/mL. The greater sensitivity of the ELISA method compared with that of the lateral flow method has previously been reported (Serrano et al., 2020). However, the sensitivity of the phage-based lateral flow test strip in this study is lower than that of a previous report of an immuno-lateral flow assay for Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium at 10 6 and 10 4 CFU/mL in culture media, respectively (Moongkarndi et al., 2011).",

            "text": "We took advantage of the exquisite sensitivity of the immune system to detect lung cancer specific antibodies at an early stage in tumor progression and develop a new autoantibody testing platform. Autoantibody to tumor-associated antigens was found in the circulation of patients in the preclinical setting [5]. It can be detected and measured in simple immunoassay and their presence A phage-displayed antibody library was applied to immobilized IgM obtained from pooled age, smoking history matched control samples, to remove phage-displayed scFv reactive with IgM present in both controls and patients with lung cancer. The cross-absorbed phage-displayed antibody library was applied to immobilized IgM purified from pooled lung cancer patients to obtain scFv specific for lung cancer IgM. Phage-displayed antibodies bound to immobilized IgM obtained from pooled lung cancer patients were eluted and used to infect E. coli and plated onto selective agar plates. Bacterial colonies from two rounds of selection were picked using a colony picker from agar plates to 384 well microtiter culture plates and induced to express soluble scFv. ScFv were transferred from 384 well culture plates to separate 384 well assay plates coated with lung cancer or control antibodies. Bacterial colonies producing scFv reactive in a homogenous fluorescent assay with lung cancer but not control antibodies were identified and used to produce larger quantities of scFv for use in subsequent assays. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060934.g001 \n\nor concentration can be correlated with occurrence of disease. As such, the autoantibody can serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Autoantibodies represent attractive candidates as a class of biomarkers also due to their robustness, stability and extensive set of tools available for their detection and quantification. \n\nWe decided to focus this research project on stage 1 NSCLCs because prompt management of malignant pulmonary nodules presenting at stage I (T1, N0, M0) could have 5 year survival rate up to 80%, and because NSCLC is the most prevalent in heterogeneous populations of lung cancer.",

            "text": "Antibodies are one of the most fascinating and versatile proteins found in vertebrates. Produced by the immune system to recognize pathogens and trigger their neutralization, the antibodies present in any individual are unique in their specificity and comprised a large repertoire generated through an elaborate process of random genetic recombination and affinity selection. [1] Since late in the 18th century, circulating antibodies have been investigated as biomarkers [1][2][3][4] and seen as natural amplifiers of traces of diseases, such as infections or pathologies causing aberrant protein secretion, expression or modification. [5,6] Nowadays, antibodies are produced through animals' immune system or recombinant as reagents for many biotechnological and clinical applications. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometer assays are among those routinely found in diagnostic laboratories. For example, IHC is used to detect protein markers in tissue biopsies supporting cancer diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring, subclassification of neurodegenerative disorders and diagnosis of muscular diseases [7,8]; serum biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen and cancer antigen 125 are determined via sandwich ELISA for monitoring prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancer [9]; and flow cytometer assays are employed for phenotyping, diagnosis and staging of hematological neoplasm, for monitoring purposes in chemotherapy, and HIV infection through count of CD4 positive lymphocytes. [10] Several formats of multiplex immunoassays have been developed and primarily applied for protein profiling, quantification and functional studies in preclinical research using tissues, cell lysates or body fluids. [4,[11][12][13][14] Clinical applications of commercialized protein arrays for diagnosis purposes are still limited to autoimmune and infectious disease, [15] nevertheless they show a potential in preclinical research also to be translated into personalized medicine applications.",

Quantum dots, nanotubes, nanowires, nanoparticles, magnetic particles, and, more recently, nanopillars are the most attractive signal transducers. 50,51 The applications of nanotechnology, with unique properties to construct novel biosensors, are constantly being expanded upon by researchs. 4,38 Antigens/specific proteins/receptors Viral infections are often associated with the presence of generic, not specific, symptoms, and thus their origin is hardly diagnosed. 52,53 The presence of the specific antibodies or antigens enables the detection of specific viral pathogen and enables to start the appropriate treatment. Antibodies are one of the most frequently used biorecognition elements for biosensor fabrication [54][55][56][57] and are produced by the host in response to the presence of foreign molecules and organisms. 52 The antibody-based diagnostics market is still growing, and therefore a new, rapid, and accurate immunodiagnostic method is required. To date, several strategies for \"reagentless biosensors\" based on antibodies and natural or engineered binding proteins have been described. 54 In the past, polyclonal antibodies were used first; recently, they were pushed out by high-affinity monoclonal antibodies. For research purposes, monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be raised specifically against a protein, another antibody, or even a whole virus and can bind with high affinity (K d =10 6 \u221210 9 M). 58 Peptides (polymeric amino acids) can specifically bind viral proteins or antibodies, too. These short peptides can be designed and synthesized by phage display. 59\u221261 Phages with strong cognitive abilities are used for fabrication of biosensors. Another way of virus detection is based on glycan-protein interactions, which are of high importance in several biological processes. A variety of carbohydrate residues, associated as the \"glycol-codes\", provide the fundamental keys for specific and high affinity \"lock-in\" recognition events associated with a wide range of pathologies. 62 A very new approach offers the design and synthesis of artificial receptors (molecularly imprinted receptors).

Efforts have been made to increase the sensitivity of immunosensors on the basis of the sandwich assay [91][92][93] and the subtractive inhibition assay (SIA) [94,95]. \n\nTo develop new biomolecular recognition elements with higher stabilities and higher affinities for target bacteria, researchers have recently integrated phage display with molecular imprinting in SPR biosensors [96]. Bacteriophages are a useful alternative to antibodies in the detection of bacteria. For example, S. aureus was detected with an SPR sensor by using a lytic phage as the recognition element, and the detection limit was 10 4 CFU/mL [97]. \n\nPhage display technology is another tool for developing single-chain antibodies to bacteria. Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes. The use of multianalyte sensors will depend on the needs of specific applications. Primary applications of such sensors include pharmaceutical research (high-throughput drug screening systems), medical diagnostics (high-throughput diagnostic tools), food safety (systems for the rapid detection of pathogens and foodborne agents), and security (devices for the early detection and identification of biological warfare and chemical agents) [70]. \n\nIn SPR-based sensors, molecular imprinting technology is as effective as antibody-or phage-based technology. Idil et al. (2021) described a variation in the SPR-based sensor that uses micro-contact imprinted chips to detect S. aureus within the range 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 -2.0 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL.",

            "text": "Currently, antibody-based detection of target proteins plays a crucial role in disease diagnostics. These assays rely on non-covalent antibody-antigen interactions, in which antibodies specifically recognize the target antigen, thereby confirming the presence of pathogens. The sensitivity and specificity of these techniques depend on the strength of antibody binding to its antigen [14]. The most widely used antibody-based antigen detection formats include ELISA, LFA, Western Blot, dot blots, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). These assays offer distinct advantages in sensitivity and ease of use, catering to diverse diagnostic needs [Table 1 and Figure 1]. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are utilized to develop immunodiagnostic tests [15]. The scalable production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies ensures a reliable and cost-effective supply for diagnostic applications, making them highly attractive for commercialization. \n\nELISA, a specific and sensitive biochemical test, facilitates analyte detection and quantitative analysis without requiring specialized equipment [16]. It is based on the principle of antigen-antibody binding, where the protein of interest is immobilized, and a specific antibody binds to it. Detection of this binding is achieved using a secondary antibody coupled with an enzyme, resulting in a color change upon reaction with a chromogenic substrate [17]. Fluorogenic or chemiluminescent substrates provide enhanced sensitivity for quantitative measurements [17]. Four major types of ELISA are commonly employed for the detection of proteins: direct, indirect, sandwich, and competition ELISA. In direct ELISA, the surface of the plate is coated with either the antibody or antigen present in the sample. Detection is achieved through an enzyme attached to either the antibody or antigen, facilitating accurate measurement  [47]. Monoclonal antibodies developed using this technique are mostly preferred among all the available methods because the isolated antibodies are highly specific to the target antigen [9]. Also, this technique is more convenient and cost-effective than other techniques [48]. This technique has expanded the antibody discovery and production scope across various applications. Multiple researchers have reported the development of monoclonal antibodies against viral antigens using hybridoma technology [21,36,49,50].",

            "text": "When detecting the presence of microorganisms in samples, using capture ligands to selectively extract one protein of interest from a complex mixture offers the advantage of revealing a single biomarker to indicate the presence of bacteria or viruses. Biopanning for phage-display peptides allows for the development of affinity ligands from virtually any organism, permits ease in utilizing these peptides with affinity-capture mass spectrometry, and holds great potential for diagnosing emerging pathogens [175]. This in vitro, antigen-driven affinity selection, employing phage display biopanning, is now a commonly used technique to isolate monoclonal antibodies [176]. \n\nPOC testing can deliver rapid diagnostics in environments where results can be used to direct clinical management during patient visits and where centralized laboratories are limited [171]. The two-dimensional affinity-capture-separation POC testing instrument that we discuss in this review can be designed not only to work in normal environments but can also function in extreme environments, including harsh temperatures, pressure, and radiation, as required in space and deep marine conditions. Evolving technology in healthcare continues to shape the way we provide care to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence, data generated in proteomics research, and the more mainstream use of telemedicine allow patients, families, and their caregivers to improve diagnostic quality anywhere in the world [103,126,163,164,177]. Sputum tests offer hope in determining protein and nucleic acid biomarkers for the diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, and lung cancer far in advance of clinical symptoms [33,178]. Sputum biomarkers have detected other diseases; for example, autoantibodies in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis [179]. Another publication reported that immunoglobulin A could be detected in sputum at an early stage in COVID-19 patients [180]. In addition, another study demonstrated the detection of antibodies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and that the sensitivity of the assay was greater in sputum than in serum [181].",

            "text": "Phage display is essential in the field of bioengineering and immunology and is also used for development of vaccines and drug molecules. 76,77 e of the outstanding advantages of phage display over other nanotechnology platforms is that it provides rapid and uniform replication for sustainable and cost-effective production on a larger scale. 78  important step of vaccine development is to select the appropriate antigen and adjuvant. Phage-based vaccination is achieved by exposing multiple foreign antigen copies on the capsid surface of immunogenic particles to obtain an effective immune response. The combinatorial peptide libraries of the phage display techniques also help to identify promising vaccine candidates against different diseases, particularly against microbial infections. Based on an affinity selection strategy, these libraries are screened to select mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. 79 ncer immunotherapy is considered a promising approach to treat cancer as an alternative to or in addition to chemotherapy and radiation because of its ability to minimize systematic side effects. 80 Current experiments on animal models are focused on several concepts of this anti-cancer immune response, and the phage display platform is modified to match each concept. In one such concept, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are considered as rational targets for cancer treatment. \n\nThus, the biopanning process of phage display toward monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies (Abs) could be performed to detect TAA mimotopes. 81,82 A better solution is to produce anti-TAA Abs continuously and endogenously in a process called active vaccination. It aims both to eliminate cancer and to decrease the risk of recurrence. 83 In this case, utilization of phages as vaccine carriers stimulates both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes and induces strong cytotoxic responses. 84,85 The goal of active vaccination is to use peptides derived from phage display to indirectly promote the immune response via its checkpoint inhibitors or to modulate immune cell activity. 72  the field of infectious diseases, an ideal treatment of an infection involves a specifically targeted antibiotic to kill the pathogen instead of broad-spectrum ones, as broad-spectrum antibiotics could lead to antibiotic resistance.",

            "text": "The critical factor that determines the efficacy of early cancer detection is t analytical platform that converts invisible molecular binding events into optical electrical signals (Figure 1). The common methods used for the detection of cancer-speci antigens (biomarkers) include ELISA, and different types of immunosensor devic [16,48,101,102]. To date, most analytical platforms for the detection of cancer biomarke use mAb as a sensing probe [10,14,20,68,70,[103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110]. There is an urgent need for robu inexpensive, highly sensitive, and easily available sensing probes, such as landsca phage substitute antibodies [33,42]. It was shown that the presentation of ~400 copies heavily constrained diagnostic peptides on the surfce of the landscape phage partic allows for a a dense interface to be formed on the detection platorms with significan increased affinity and selectivity towards the analyte markers in comparison w individual randomly conjugated peptide binders with a mostly disordered conformati [35,50,111,112]. ACT). The f8/8 landscape phage library was added to the dishes with different immobilized forms of PSA. Unbound phages were washed away, and bound phages were eluted and used as a sub-library in the next round of biopanning. After three rounds, the individual phage clones were propagated, and their DNA segments corresponding to gpVIII were sequenced to determine the corresponding phage-displayed peptide sequences. Detailed procedures can be found in [25,37,100]. \n\nThrough three rounds of biopanning and phage-capture assay, novel phage clone P1-and P5-displaying octamers ERNSVSPS and ATRSANGM with the best affinity and selectivity for t-PSA were identified and used as the capture probes to establish both ELISA and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay systems (Figures 9-12).",

            "text": "In the past few decades, biosensors have emerged as an alternative to conventional diagnostic methods. Biosensors are highly advantageous due to their high sensitivity, low-cost, ease-of-use and rapid response time for analyte detection [12]. A biosensor comprises a biorecognition element that binds to a target analyte (e.g. bacteria, virus, protein, polysaccharide) and transducer elements that translate the binding occurrence into a detectable signal with a detector providing readout (Figure 1) [13]. The translation of prototype biosensors to commercial development has hitherto been a slow process. However, in response to the emerging need for POC diagnostics and the manifold benefits of sensor-based testing, numerous new commercial biosensors are being introduced to worldwide markets. Table 1 highlights some sensor-based products for the identification of pathogens that are currently available on the market. Most of these products are based on immunological principles using antibodies to recognise the analyte. These commercial sensor platforms are usually in the form of lateral flow immunoassays (LFA), latex agglutination assays and rapid antigen tests. Other classes of novel biorecognition elements that have shown some promise in pathogen identification are still not commonly used in commercial sensors. Regarding the detection systems, biosensors based on electrochemical, piezoelectric and optical principles are still not widely commercialised. some sensor-based products for the identification of pathogens that are currently available on the market.

            "text": "Perspective pathogen, 92 or phages can be utilized as a means to display the biorecognition element, be it an antibody fragment, a peptide, or any other protein binder. Antibody fragments, mostly singlechain variable fragments (scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of advantage. 87 Other common recombinant antibody fragments include the heavychain antibodies (V HH ), also known as nanobodies or singledomain antibodies, which have gained significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is completely devoid of the light chains. 66,93 Alternatively, short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency. Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications. Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects. Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. \n\nRecombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes have been published recently using other transduction techniques, for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic, and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets (Table 1), but for a comprehensive overview of phagebased biosensors, we refer the reader to recent review articles. 7,91,92,94",

            "text": "Sensitive and selective detection of bacterial pathogens is an area of interest due to increasing concerns over food, water, environment and public health safety [1]. Conventional microbiological and serological assay are reliable for pathogen identification and detection but are time consuming, labor intensive and cost ineffective [2]. Some reports suggest that selective and differential plating method may not always give an accurate identification of the bacteria in real life samples [3]. Biosensors have been looked upon as alternative for detecting pathogen, their spores and toxin using different transduction platforms. A biosensor has two key components; a biological probing element (e.g. protein, peptide, deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, whole organism), which imparts specificity of recognition, and a transducer, which converts the recognition event into a measurable signal. Different probing elements and transducer platforms have been integrated to improve the recognition specificity and detection sensitivity of a pathogen biosensor. \n\nMass perturbance [4], electrochemical [1], flow cytometry [5], optical [1,6] and mechanical resonator-based [7,8] sensors have been explored for developing a sensitive pathogen detection platform. Antibodies/peptides [4], DNA [9], RNA [10], aptamers [11], peptide nucleic acid (PNA) [12] and carbohydrate [13] have similarly been used as recognition elements to detect different pathogens. Antibodies particularly have been extensively used as molecular probe for pathogen detection [14]. However, antibodies suffer from temperature and pH instability and are prone to protease degradation [15]. Polyclonal antibodies further suffer from cross-reactivity. Bacteriophages therefore have been looked upon as a robust alternative biological probe for pathogen detection. Phages are bacterial viruses that recognize and bind to specific receptor on the host bacterial surface. Many phages use their tail spike proteins for host recognition and binding [16]. The phage recognition is highly specific and is thus used for bacterial typing. This specificity and selectivity makes intact phages an excellent candidate as probing element in a biosensor.",

            "text": "In these cases, it is recommended to use alternative methods like non-antibody binding proteins (or protein scaffolds) and in vitro antibody display technologies (Alfaleh et al., 2020;Gebauer and Skerra, 2020). In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, protein scaffolds are single polypeptide chain structures without disulfide bridges or post-translational modifications that show high solubility and stability and can allow the selection for affinity, stability, and enzymatic activity (Simeon and Chen, 2018;Gebauer and Skerra, 2020). Additionally, in vitro antibody display technologies have many advantages, including the ability to be genetically modified to increase selectivity, specificity, and sensitivity, ease of production in E. coli, and reproducibility (Frenzel et al., 2017;Chiu et al., 2019;Raeisi et al., 2022a). Hence, various studies have suggested the use of phage display-derived antibodies for diagnostic purposes (Chamorro and Merko\u00e7i, 2016;Mohd Ali et al., 2021). Innovative developments based on antibodies (e.g. various biosensor platforms) can provide rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection capability, which help the accurate diagnosis of specific targets. Importantly, due to the increase in public health concerns about nosocomial CDI, designing immunosensors can be proposed for rapid detection and disease management (Zhu et al., 2014b). Additionally, the combination of nanotechnology and various biosensor platforms has attracted a lot of attention as an excellent approach for developing fast, highly, sensitive and specific devices for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections (Prasad, 2014;Park et al., 2016), which can improve the quality and precision of disease diagnosis (Castillo et al., 2020;Younis et al., 2020). Application of rAb fragments (scFv, sdAb, etc.) to develop immunosensors or immunoassays has several distinct advantages, the most important of them is that rAb fragments can be readily produced in vitro. In addition, rAbs are easily formatted through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation for coupling antibodies to the sensors used to detect antigens.",

The common methods used for the detection of cancer-specific antigens (biomarkers) include ELISA, and different types of immunosensor devices [16,48,101,102]. To date, most analytical platforms for the detection of cancer biomarkers use mAb as a sensing probe [10,14,20,68,70,[103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110]. There is an urgent need for robust, inexpensive, highly sensitive, and easily available sensing probes, such as landscape phage substitute antibodies [33,42]. It was shown that the presentation of ~400 copies of heavily constrained diagnostic peptides on the surfce of the landscape phage particles allows for a a dense interface to be formed on the detection platorms with significantly increased affinity and selectivity towards the analyte markers in comparison with individual randomly conjugated peptide binders with a mostly disordered conformation [35,50,111,112].",

Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

            "text": "In this paper, we describe the development of a biological equivalent to the LAT, an assay widely used in medical diagnostics. Our bioassay includes cells that are genetically engineered to display nanobodies on their surface, analogous to the latex particles coated with antibodies in LATs. The presence of the analyte induces bacterial cross-linking, which is visible to the naked eye and enables facile detection of the target analyte in a manner similar to the readout of the LAT. This expands the repertoire of the types of analytes that can be sensed using whole-cell biosensors to include large molecules such as protein biomarkers or disease agents, which cannot easily be transported into the cell. \n\nWhole-cell biosensors have become an alternative promising tool for the detection of analytes in diverse applications, as they are easy to manipulate, simple and low-cost. Our platform adds a new tool to this arsenal for the extracellular detection of protein analytes. Additionally, our platform is unique in enabling analyte detection without requiring active transcription and translation of a reporter protein. This contrasts with most previous solutions where the output signal is dependent on active gene expression for reporter protein production. 12,37,38 Lastly, the platform can potentially offer large cost savings to assay manufacturers as the cells autonomously express and surface display nanobodies which removes the need for the costly steps of antibody production, purification, and attachment to latex particle surfaces. \n\nThe design of our biological LAT is inherently modular and is readily extensible to the detection of other analytes of interest by exchanging the nanobody that is surfacedisplayed through simple molecular cloning techniques. There are numerous developed nanobodies described in the literature. 39 Alternatively, phage-display libraries can be used to select new nanobodies for different targets or to enhance specificity, 40,41 or immunization, e.g., of camels orllamas can be used to isolate new nanobodies if desired. 42 Thus, the technology described here could be used as a platform for the development of a range of assays for different target analytes. For inherently multivalent targets, a nanobody that binds to a single epitope is all that is necessary to develop a new assay.",

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies [167].\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development [168]. The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones [139]. These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture [169], electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) [170], and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) [170].\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143].\n\nConversion of antibody fragments into full IgG format or Fc format is always preferable for therapeutics [171]. Na\u00efve Fab antibody fragments isolated against HA region of H5N1 virus were converted into full human IgG format. These antibodies showed binding to conserved region HA2 and exhibited promising",

            "text": "For the identification of immunogenic proteins of pathogens a common method is a 2D-PAGE of cultured pathogens followed by an immunoblot using sera from infected patients or animals which is then analysed by mass spectrometry or microsequencing [68][69][70][71][72]. Weakly expressed antigens or differentially expressed proteins, e.g. dependent on pathogen-host interaction, may not be identified by this method [73]. In these cases, oligopeptide phage display can circumvent these limitations, because oligopeptides can be identified independent of their in vivo expression level. Oligopeptide phage display has been used to identify novel immunogenic proteins of different bacteria, e.g. Mycoplasma species [22,55,74], viruses, e.g. Cytomegalovirus [19], protozoa [75] and higher eucaryotic organisms [76]. An overview is given in Table 1. \n\nBeside the identification of immunogenic proteins in pathogen research, oligopeptide phage display is also used in other disease associated fields. Oligopeptide phage display is used for the identification of immunogenic proteins in allergies [56,57,[77][78][79]. A related field is the identification of auto antigens in auto immune diseases [39,80]. In cancer research, oligopeptide phage display is used to analyse the humoral immune response on tumor antigens [40,81]. A special application for phage display is the identification of epitopes using oligopeptide phage display. In most cases, peptide phage display libraries displaying 7-15mer random peptides are screened on immobilised antibodies to identify immungenic epitopes. This results only in the identification of short mimotopes (sequences mimicking the epitope) [82][83][84]. Also the identification of conformational epitopes is hampered by the short peptides displayed by random peptide libraries.",

            "text": "State-of-the-art genomic and proteomic information was utilized to develop and refine an assay that can quantify the presence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (Figure 1). A total of 268 samples in the autoantibody-binding peptide discovery and assessment study were collected from prostate cancer positive and biopsy negative controls. Twenty-one phage-peptides were analyzed to determine the specific biological markers known to be associated with an immune system response to aggressive prostate cancer [14]. The phage proteins were developed by a technique in which bacteriophages are engineered to fuse a foreign peptide or protein with their capsid proteins and hence expose or display it on their external surface [13]. The immobilized phage may then be used as a screen to see which ligands bind to the expressed fusion protein displayed on the phage surface. The bio-panning process is an iterative process of affinity purification used in the identification and isolation of phages carrying peptides with high affinity and specificity to a given target molecule. Briefly, a library of phage-displayed peptides is incubated with a plate (or bead substrate) coated with the target. Unbound phage particles are washed away, and the bound phages eluted. This process is then repeated several times. This process was used to develop the library of autoantibody-binding peptides used in the biomarker discovery phase of product development Our aim was to then test and validate the performance of this expanded serum-based multiplexed autoantibody assay in the risk assessment of patients with high-grade prostate cancer versus PSA. Using a training set of 196 subjects, a unique algorithm was developed to discern between men with low-and high-grade cancers independent of PSA levels. The final algorithm incorporated the ten autoantibodybinding peptides prioritized for aggressive cancer detection (Table 6). \n\nThe assay and the classifier algorithm using the 10 specific autoantibody-binding peptides optimizes the negative predictive value and minimizes false negative results for Gleason 7+ disease. Finally, a validation analysis using independent samples from 296 subjects assessed the performance of the diagnostic algorithm.",

            "title": "Applications of Nanozymology in the Detection and Identification of Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens",
            "text": "Several methods are used for the detection of pathogens. Most of these methods are specific for a limited scope of pathogens and are not usable outside their pathogen specificity scope. For example, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is used to detect antibodies of the pathogens that cause specific viral and bacterial diseases [55,56]. It is therefore desirable to determine if the use of nanozymology offers enhanced specificity or any advantages for the detection and identification of virulent pathogens compared to, or when used in conjunction with established methods. The proposed contribution of the current review to science is an analysis of the significance of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification based on selected literature reports, on the application of nanozymology for the detection and identification of virulent pathogens from various sources. The mechanism of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of pathogen analytes, of evaluating the detection antibody, using the cascade reaction amplification which is typically accomplished using a colorimetric reaction signal is largely emulated among the vast majority of nanozyme methods. \n\nIn the same way that the lateral flow immunoassays mimic the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on the lateral flow flat pad along which the analyte moves by osmosis, picking up the specific detection antibodies and the signal amplification reagents [57,58], so too do most of the nanozyme lateral flow method types. Nanozymology detection and identification methods therefore use nanozymes generally in place of the enzymes in the traditional methods for the detection and identification of pathogens. In this regard, Sun et al., (2020) cited several noble metal nanoparticles that have been used as nanozymes, including gold, platinum, palladium, and iron, together with a series of the biosensors in which they have been used as enzyme surrogates for the detection and identification of viral and bacterial pathogens [59]. Biosensors play a very important role in point-of-care detection and identification of disease-causing pathogens such as viruses and bacteria for purposes of disease diagnosis and therapy.",

            "text": "[18][19][20].\n\nThere are various applications of a phage display. In the current work, we used a phage display for the discovery of TB biomarkers. The same system can be applied to identify novel markers for multi-drug resistance in TB, which is becoming a major issue in TB treatment. Additionally, phage displays can be used for the development of specific targeted therapies [42]. The phage display technology and immunoscreening has utilities not only in identifying diagnostic biomarkers, but also may enable us to develop a novel targeted therapy utilizing the peptide sequences (mimotopes) as vehicles to deliver specific drugs. The identified sequences can be used to develop peptide/protein-coated magnetic nanoparticles for clinical testing or for applications in drug delivery [43]. Additionally, this technology might enable us to discover unknown epitopes targeting specific bacterial antigens leading to immunogenicity and antibody production in TB subjects, as well as providing us with a better understanding of host immune defenses in TB subjects. For instance, TB sera were less reactive to some of the identified clones (TetR, menD, CobN, and OplA), these clones are less likely to be used for diagnostic purposes. However, these clones can be used to develop new vaccine and to boost the immunity against TB infection. Furthermore, this microarray platform can be hybridized to detect IgA in sputum of TB patients that may have clinical values. Moreover, antibody detection in the sera of patients has a potential value in clinical practice, as it is non-invasive and requires a minimal amount of blood or other bodily fluids.\n\nThe lack of sensitivity and specificity and cross-reactivity of biomarkers with other diseases dampened the enthusiasm in TB biomarker discovery studies. However, our study shows excellent sensitivity and specificity, not only as compared to healthy controls but also to another granulomatous disease. Other studies using gene expression profiling between TB and sarcoidosis found 94% similarities [44,45]. Our system has the advantage of detecting TB clones with high sensitivity and specificity and is based on an immune reaction rather than gene expression. The detection of this immune reaction, in form of antibodies, relies on a complex interaction between antigen presenting cells, T cells and B cells",

            "text": "of detection (LOD) of less than 0.5 ng/mL 16,[18][19][20] . However, these assays are relatively time-consuming, expensive and lack portability for on-site application. Alternatively, cheaper and more rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been developed. These are based on a competitive ELISA format where 3-PBA in the sample competes for antibody binding sites with an artificial antigen consisting of a 3-PBA-protein conjugate or a minor modification of this format. For example, colorimetric competitive ELISA assays using anti-3-PBA antibodies have been successfully demonstrated with a LOD between 0.1 and 1.94 ng/mL in urine and plasma samples [21][22][23] . \n\nMoreover, it has been shown that single-domain camelid nanobodies (VHHs) can be substituted for the full-length conventional antibodies without impairing assay performance 24 . Since VHH antibodies are monomeric proteins expressed from a single gene, they are easier to express than conventional antibodies. Interestingly, using phages expressing multiple copies of the VHH as the detection element improved the LOD by an order of magnitude because the multi-valency of the phage increased the output signal 25 . More recently, Huo et al. 26 reported the use of a VHH-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (VHH-AP) for one-step 3-PBA detection. These findings highlight the significance of VHHs in developing assays for 3-PBA detection. However, even ELISA methods still require relatively specialist operators and sophisticated instruments for detection, which limits their field application. \n\nWhole-cell bacterial biosensors are a low-cost, well-characterized and easy to manipulate alternative platform for detecting analytes. Whole-cell biosensors have been demonstrated as potential diagnostic tools for detecting a wide variety of compounds in clinical and environmental samples and have been engineered to produce a simple visible output such as pigments, luminescence or fluorescence signals 27,28 . Many studies have highlighted the possibility of applying bacterial biosensors for field detection because of their simplicity, low cost, and portability [29][30][31][32] .",

So, it is possible to obtain small peptides that mimic specific antigen epitopes (Goulart et al., 2010), or develop biomarkers using Fab (fragment antigen-binding) or scFv (single-chain variable fragment) antibody fragments (Leow et al., 2014). One of the great advantages of peptides and antibodies obtained by PD is their flexibility to be used in different diagnostic platforms, from conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Rojas et al., 2014) to biotechnological platforms, such as those involving immunosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Kim et al., 2015). SPR immunosensors explore the capacity of an antibody to recognize its antigen with different affinities and can be built using an optical signal transduction by a light bean that passes through a prism and reaches a metallic surface (Kretschmann, 1971). These immunosensors represent a great advance to the creation of diagnostic platforms, enabling real time, quantitative, and much more sensitive analysis than the conventional immunoassays (Ngubane et al., 2013). \n\nHere, we present a successful PGL-I mimetic chimeric peptide (mimotope) obtained by PD, which was chemically synthesized with similar immunological properties of the natural antigen. The mimotope was validated by ELISA and SPR, and a reverse engineered antibody against the mimotope demonstrated that the peptide mimics the trisaccharide portion of the antigen. The characterization and diagnostic implications of this novel PGL-I-like peptide are discussed herein.",

The use of bacteriophages in combination with a variety of transducers has led to the development of new biosensors, with advanced bioanalytical capabilities enabling the identification of novel biomarkers. The design of a peptide-based biosensor requires two main stages: (i) receptor selection, and (ii) functionalization by selecting the appropriate synthetic peptides [118][119][120][121]. Biosensors are commonly used in a variety of roles, that include the identification of bacteria, detection of complete phage particles, and recognition of molecules such as peptides (Figure 4). Recently, RBPs have been used as novel sensing elements that provide binding capabilities equivalent to those displayed by whole phages, but being considerably smaller, they facilitate the construction of highly effective diagnostic tools [48,49,122,123]. The RBPs can also be used in ELISA-based assays [57,124] as well as for glycotyping Salmonella [10] and Listeria [125].

            "text": "Pathogen infections, autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders are associated with systemic antibody responses from the host immune system. Disease-specific antibodies can be important serum biomarkers, but the identification of antigens associated with specific immune reactions is challenging, in particular if complex communities of microorganisms are involved in the disease progression. Despite promising new diagnostic opportunities, the discovery of these serological markers becomes more difficult with increasing complexity of microbial communities. In the present work, we used a metagenomic M13 phage display approach to select immunogenic oligopeptides from the gut microbiome of transgenic mice suffering from chronic ileitis. We constructed three individual metaproteome phage display libraries with a library size of approximately 107 clones each. Using serum antibodies, we selected and validated three oligopeptides that induced specific antibody responses in the mouse model. This proof-of-concept study provides the first successful application of functional metaproteome display for the study of protein-protein interactions and the discovery of potential disease biomarkers.",

            "text": "ELISA was used to determine the quantitative parameters of each of the nanotags either separately or in combination with the recombinant phage platform together with the positioning of probe or transducer peptides. In addition, since the saturation concentrations of the nanotags are well known, the potential for designing competitive analyses or assays becomes relevant for our nanotechnology platform. In this light, an FMDV-specific immunogenic epitope in a competitive titration assay with its cognate SD6 antibody was used to achieve binding and quantitative recognition of the target. The detection of FMDV specific antibodies with a recombinant RNA phage platform ushers in a new era in biosensor nanotechnology where the transducer could change based on the targeted agonist and its environmental conditions. Moreover, dependent upon the proximity of the probe and transducer peptides, binding to one cognate antibody abrogated access by its competitor, thereby providing a novel platform for combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of nanobioprobes [46,47]. Thus, the standardized transducer (biotinbinding peptide) can be used to titer unknown cognate antibody probes using a similar competitive ELISA as demonstrated in our study. Organic transducers can be used for sensitive biomolecular targets and inorganic substance application under harsh conditions. Regarding existing and continuously evolving pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, Lassa fever virus, Ebola, Marburg, and monkeypox-derived epitopes, we envisaged developing biosensors using a Strep II tag or biotin-binding peptides for the titration of pathogen-specific protective antibodies in vaccinated and exposed populations over time. Similar biosensors could be developed for the clinical detection of emergent and re-emergent pathogens.",

We evaluated their biochemical properties with the aim of applying these Nanobodies as detecting reagents, and most importantly to demonstrate their applicability for SF surveillance. The nanobody (Nb, also known as VHH) as an alternative antibody format is the single domain antigenbinding fragment derived from the heavy chain-only antibody (HCAb) naturally occurring in camelids [25,26]. The straightforward selection via phage display of specific Nbs against virtually any target of interest has been established and retrieves effective affinity reagents for diagnosis and therapy [27,28]. More importantly, the unique paratopes of Nbs facilitate the targeting of their cognate antigens with high specificity and affinity and even allow the binding to the epitopes that are less accessible to conventional antibodies [29,30]. The excellent biochemical characteristics of Nbs, including the good solubility in aqueous solvents and high stability even under harsh conditions such as high temperature, extreme pH, and presence of chemical denaturants, qualified Nbs as promising candidates to develop diagnostic reagents for clinical applications [31,32]. \n\nIn this study, we developed Nbs with specificity against a clinical diagnostic indicator of SF and evaluated their potential as a tool for SF surveillance. In general, an immune Nb library was constructed after consecutive immunization with the antigen protein, which served as the Nb repertoire to retrieve SF-specific Nbs after several rounds of biopanning and screening. The characteristics, including specificity, affinity, and thermal stability of the retrieved Nbs have been measured to identify the lead Nbs. The targeting of the selected Nbs to SF has been verified by immunoprecipitation or blotting assay. The potential of selected SF-specific Nbs as diagnostic reagents has been confirmed by developing a heterologous Nb-pair-based sandwich ELISA with sufficiently high sensitivity and good reproducibility.",

[31,32] Among them, due to their low-cost, instrument-free, and easy-to-use nature, LFAs, in the form of rapid antigen tests using virus-specific biorecognition elements (like antibodies), are also highly favorable for on-site virus detection to control infectious disease spread to a certain extent. [33] All of the assays explained above are informative methods for rapidly identifying the current and previous exposures to a particular virus while also specifying the extent of infection. [27] However, their low accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity due to cross-reactivity with similar pathogens are restraining. Consequently, existing direct antigen tests and serological assays cannot substitute RT-PCR testing but are rather suitable as complementary diagnostic tools. [27,34] hese limiting factors, coupled with supply chain concerns and inconsistencies between the test results, led to alternating approaches such as biosensors, which can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional diagnostic methods for viral infectious diseases. From this standpoint, biosensors offer many promising features: i) low costs, ii) rapid, simultaneous, and susceptible detection of various analytes, iii) short turnaround times, iv) high specificity and selectivity, v) adaptability for onsite (even wearable) testing, continuous monitoring, and multiplexed detection, and vi) integrability for simultaneous data transfer to a central or distributed database. [34] n this review, we shortly introduce the fundamentals of biosensors, followed by a survey of the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for detecting viral pathogens and/or associated (like serological and inflammation) biomarkers. Herein, we thoroughly discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each strategy.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most diagnosed cancer among men. It was observed that early diagnosis of disease is highly beneficial for the survival of cancer patients. Therefore, the extension and increasing quality of life of PC patients can be achieved by broadening the cancer screening programs that are aimed at the identification of cancer manifestation in patients at earlier stages, before they demonstrate well-understood signs of the disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for standard, sensitive, robust, and commonly available screening and diagnosis tools for the identification of early signs of cancer pathologies. In this respect, the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of cancer researchers and bioengineers for decades has been molecular sensing probes that would allow for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of cancer diseases via their interaction with cell-secreted and cell-associated PC biomarkers, e.g., PSA and PSMA, respectively. At present, most PSA tests are performed at centralized laboratories using high-throughput total PSA immune analyzers, which are suitable for dedicated laboratories and are not readily available for broad health screenings. Therefore, the current trend in the detection of PC is the development of portable biosensors for mobile laboratories and individual use. Phage display, since its conception by George Smith in 1985, has emerged as a premier tool in molecular biology with widespread application. This review describes the role of the molecular evolution and phage display paradigm in revolutionizing the methods for the early diagnosis and monitoring of PC.",

As before, examples are provided for key biothreat agents and are categorized according to their consequent applicationseither in detection or profiling.\n\nPathogen detection using non-DNA-based microarrays Antibodies have become an established denominator for disease detection, through the time-honoured use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), agglutination and lateral-flow assays. As a next-generation tool, antibody microarrays are increasing in popularity, and not without reason, for they offer unparalleled throughput, minimal reagent consumption and sensitive detection of multiple targets simultaneously [10]. The accuracy conferred is nevertheless closely linked with the quality of Review Trends in Biotechnology Vol. 27 No.1 antibodies employed, and there are issues relating to crossreactivity and antibody availability, both of which are particularly crucial for finer and more accurate strain typing. Notwithstanding these matters, a plethora of antibody microarrays have been developed that have growing potential for clinical, biothreat and point-of-care applications (Figure 2c). Rucker et al. [43] applied antibody microarrays for the detection of toxins with low-nanomolar sensitivities, such as anthrax lethal factor (LF, a metalloendopeptidase), protective antigen (PA) and tetanus toxins (endopeptidases), through the co-application of a competitive fluorescently-labelled toxin reporter. In this setting, the samples can be tested without the need for labelling by monitoring the depletion and competitive displacement of reporter signals generated by the labelled reporter. Thirty-five antibodies were also arrayed to subtype the 20 most common Salmonella serovars [44], and a similar study was undertaken for Escherichia coli [45]. In an impressive demonstration of the detection throughput attainable, Huelseweh and colleagues [46] built an antibody microarray to detect several Category A and B agents simultaneously, including F. tularensis, Y. pestis, Brucella melitensis (which causes brucellosis) and B. mallei, using sandwich immunoassays (Figure 2c).",

            "text": "In contrast to molecular diagnostics where advances in technology such as PCR and HTS have dramatically improved sensitivity, specificity, and capacity for multiplex analyses, serologic methods remained largely unchanged. This lag is important given the role of serology in establishing the distribution and frequency of infection, testing the significance of association between the finding of an agent and disease, focusing efforts in pathogen discovery and surveillance, and for monitoring humoral responses to vaccines and immunomodulatory drugs. Most serological tests target only one agent; however, Luminex-based systems have been employed that can address up to 100 targets simultaneously. \n\nPhage display systems and arrays that comprise spotted recombinant proteins expressed in vitro in E. coli, S. cerevesiae, baculoviruses, and cell-free, coupled transcription-translation, have also been established. The VirScan platform comprehensively tests for the presence of antiviral antibodies through immunoprecipitation of viral peptides in bacteriophage followed by DNA sequencing. The current version screens 93,904 200-mer oligonucleotides, encoding 56-residue peptide that tile the proteome of 206 viral species with 28 residue overlap (Xu et al., 2015). The phage library is incubated with serum, plasma, or CSF. Bound antibodies are recovered by using a mixture of protein A and G coated magnetic beads. The bound phage DNA is sequenced and quantitated to identify immunoreactive epitopes. These assays are powerful but require expertize and resources for cDNA cloning, expression, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. An additional challenge is that VirScan may not have the resolution required to differentiate immune responses to closely related viruses. Peptide arrays (Serochips) are an alternative high throughput platform for unbiased serology. Serochips comprise up to 6 million distinct linear peptide sequences attached to a solid support. Like the VirScan platform, Serochips display only linear peptides; thus, neither platform will detect conformational or glycosylated epitopes.",

            "text": "clinical settings (Mina et al., 2020). While antibody (e.g., IgM) detection has been used for disease diagnostics (Broadhurst et al., 2016), it is less predictive and more suitable for immune response studies. In comparison, viral protein antigen tests provide a reliable field-test solution in diagnosing symptomatic patients (Albert et al., 2020;Broadhurst et al., 2016;Perkins and Kessel, 2015). In addition, since they are rapid, easy to operate, and low-cost, antigen tests can be deployed at high frequencies and large volumes for in-time surveillance, which is thought to be one crucially important factor in disrupting a virus transmission chain (Larremore et al., 2021;Mina et al., 2020).\n\nCurrent antigen diagnostics typically employ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs). ELISA is the workhorse for analyzing antigens and antibodies, but it requires a multistep workflow and a series of washing steps, hours of incubation prior to readout, and a readout system dependent on substrate conversion and luminescence recording. Deployment of ELISAs in highthroughput mass screenings requires automated liquid handling systems to coordinate the complex workflow, which is not ideal for portable uses. LFIs are potentially much easier to use outside lab settings but usually have much lower sensitivity and thus poorer accuracy compared to ELISA (Lisboa Bastos et al., 2020). Here we report a modular strategy, i.e., nanobody-conjugated nanoparticles for rapid electronic detection (Nano2RED), which can quickly establish a rapid, accessible antigen diagnostic tool within a few weeks of pathogen identification. To generate high-quality affinity reagents within two weeks for any given purified marker protein, we have streamlined a protocol for phage selection of single-domain antibodies (or nanobodies) (Muyldermans 2013) from a highly diverse combinatorial library (>10 9 )The selected nanobodies were genetically fused with an AviTag for site-specific biotinylation and immobilization onto streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles (Au",

With these unique features, nanobody-based approaches are becoming promising tools for diagnostic applications (Li et al., 2014). \n\nWhen compared with the traditional antibodies or soluble nanobodies, phage-displayed nanobodies have the advantages of ease of production, reproducibility and lowcost. Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure. Meanwhile, the affinity of nanobody P2 could be improved by site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acids in CDR3.",

            "text": "The present study describes a subtractive phage display strategy that led to the identification of novel antigens to aid in CVL serodiagnosis. The selected phage clones were able to discriminate the serum samples from L. infantum-infected dogs from the crossreactive serum samples infected by other parasites, as well as from the serum samples from vaccinated dogs using a phage-ELISA technique. Since its first description (36) and introduction into laboratory practice (37), phage display technology has proven to be useful in selecting specific peptides that are highly reactive against many pathogen targets. Its biological applications have ranged from use in studies of vaccine candidates for rabies (38), hepatitis C (39), E. coli (40), Plasmodium vivax (23), and Schistosoma japonicum (41) to use with diagnostic antigens for the detection of antibodies to pneumonia (42), neurocysticercosis (43)(44)(45), equine viral arteritis (46), rabies (47), and anaplasmosis (48). These phage-displayed peptides, also called mimotopes, have shown either linear or conformational recognition with high affinity to paratope sequences of antibodies. In this context, the present study used a subtractive approach through phage display in order to identify new antigens for the serodiagnosis of CVL so as to identify phage clones that express target peptides capable of being recognized by antibodies present in the serum samples from L. infantum-infected dogs. Aimed at identifying more refined antigens for CVL serodiagnosis, the selected phage clones were tested in a serological panel in phage-ELISAs. Serological tests are currently recommended for the laboratorial diagnosis of CVL. IFAT and ELISA are the most widely used diagnostic assays that are applicable to leishmaniasis; however, their low sensitivities for detecting cases with low levels of Leishmania-specific antibodies, as well as their cross-reactivity with other diseases, including Chagas' disease represent important limitations for their use in the CVL serodiagnosis (49,50). In addition, crude antigens are",

            "text": "Phage display library may be constructed using any of the above-mentioned phage display systems and screened to obtain the most promising binders exhibiting strongest affinity for the target molecule/pathogen for use in diagnostics and immunotherapy. Either randomly generated fragments of targeted pathogen DNA or synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the phage genome leading to generation of Natural peptide library (NPL) or Random peptide library (RPL), respectively. NPLs are more likely to mount an antibody response that cross-reacts with the native intact pathogen but a vast majority of clones in these libraries are non-functional, whereas RPLs have extended range of displayed epitopes [37,38]. When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

Indeed, paper-based sensors have been used for the detection of cancer biomarkers as well as for the diagnostic of viral infections such as Ebola (Brangel et al., 2018), influenza A H1N1 (Lei et al., 2015) and recently, SARS-CoV-2 . Paper-based biosensors can be classified into dipstick assay, lateral flow assay (LFA) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mPADs). Generally, LFA is frequently used for pathogen detection due to their user-friendliness, low cost, and relatively high sensitivity. The paper substrates routinely used are cellulose (dipstick, mPADs) and nitrocellulose (LFA) membranes (Hu et al., 2014).\n\nWu and colleagues (Wu et al., 2017) developed an automated and portable paper-based microfluidic system for Influenza diagnosis, which consisted of a storage module with reagent chambers and a reaction module with the absorbent pad and nitrocellulose membrane functionalized with specific monoclonal antibodies. A smartphone was used to capture the image from the membrane and process the image with a Java algorithm.\n\nPhotonic biosensors have a high signal-to-noise ratio, and they can convert the molecular binding events to optical signals, easing the integration into mobile phones. For example, Su and colleagues developed a portable module that can detect clinically relevant levels of a secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, an established biomarker for a lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Moreover, the results can be interpreted instantly and transmitted to the medical personnel (Sun et al., 2016).\n\nGraphene-based biosensors",

H\u00e4nninen 1,2 Assessment of risk for a given disease and the diagnosis of diseases is often based on assays detecting biomarkers. Antibody-based biomarker-assays for diseases such as prostate cancer are often ambiguous and biomarker proteins are frequently also elevated for reasons that are unspecific. We have opted to use luminescence modulating phages for the analysis of known acute inflammatory response biomarker CRP (C-reactive protein) and biomarkers of prostate cancer in urine samples. Firstly, CRP was used to simulate the detection process in a controlled chemical environment. Secondly, we tried to classify more challenging lethal prostate cancer samples from control samples. Our unique method utilizes a special biopanning process in order to create special phages capable of capturing a dye necessary for detection and potential biomarkers. As the biomarker-molecules interfere with the phages, dye is repelled from the phage network resulting in an altered reporter luminescence. These changes can be observed with an absorbance reader and even with the naked eye. The simple method could present an alternative for screening of disease biomarkers. For prostate cancer urine samples, we achieved a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75% to detect Grade Group (GG) 4 and 5 prostate cancer. \n\nPreventive healthcare optimally relies in addition to healthy lifestyle promotion and education of the population also on early diagnostics and screening of common diseases with significant public health impact. For example, screening coupled with proper treatment of communicable diseases like tuberculosis have resulted in outcomes that have changed the disease landscape permanently. Yet diagnosis of non-communicable diseases often occurs only after the patient has experienced symptoms. Also, diagnostic methods are not always compatible with massscreening purposes yielding a delayed treatment window starting later than desired for optimal outcomes from the patient and healthcare system point of view. \n\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) based screening and early detection of PCa is challenging because it leads to significant overdiagnosis and potentially also overtreatment of clinically insignificant low-risk disease.",

            "text": "Bacteriophages may be promising biomarkers and detection tools in water quality management, especially in water treatment in regions like SSA, where water quality is a big problem. Phages' specificity and host range (narrow) allow for precise detection of pathogenic bacteria in water sources, which is crucial for ensuring food and water safety. Advancements in phage-based detection methods have demonstrated the efficacy of phages in accurately identifying waterborne pathogens with great precision. In contrast, most common approaches used in the detection of pathogens, e.g., agar plate cultures, enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and PCR technology, are time-consuming and take from a few hours to a few days, have high costs, are technically complex, may have limited sensitivity or specificity problems, and present challenges in differentiation between viable and non-viable cells [115]. Recently, bacteriophages have increasingly been deployed as bioprobes in microbial detection because of their high specificity and affinity, low cost, robustness, and high stability [115]. For instance, Anany and colleagues [116] developed a phage-based \"dipstick\" assay that provides rapid and ultrasensitive detection of foodborne pathogens, which can be adapted for waterborne pathogen detection. The approach uses a combination of phage amplification and qPCR to detect bacterial pathogens; the method demonstrated high sensitivity for various pathogens, including E. coli and V. cholerae. Another innovative method involves phage lytic assays combined with bioluminescence detection. The method monitors the release of intracellular components such as ATP after phage-induced lysis, providing a rapid and sensitive measure of bacterial concentration in water samples [117]. \n\nPhage applications have also been deployed as real-time monitoring tools in water treatment facilities. The approach relies on phage-based reporters in which genetically engineered phages are used to carry reporter genes, which may lead to measurable signals upon infection in bacteria [118]. The approach was applied to specifically detect Salmonella in water samples, providing a rapid and reliable means of contamination assessment [119]. \n\nIn SSA, the implementation of phage-based detection approaches is still in its infancy.",

Traditional singleplex assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detect a specific protein, but more contemporary multiplex methods simultaneously measure many target proteins over a wide dynamic range without the need for the depletion of abundant proteins. These assays are dependent on highly specific antibodies or modified aptamers. For instance, the Mesoscale Discovery Technology Platform (MSD) and the Q-Plex array (Quansys Biosciences) have capture antibodies immobilized on a solid phase support, while the Luminex (ThermoFisher), Cytometric Bead Arrays (BD Biosciences) and Bio-PlexPro (BioRad) assays utilize antibodies conjugated to fluorescently-activated microbeads to allow identification and detection using a flow cytometry-based method [41,42]. The SOMAscan technology utilizes modified aptamers, or SOMAmers, which are short strands of DNA that recognize specific target epitopes [43,44]. Affinity-based protein profiling assays depend on antibodies or aptamers that recognize specific epitopes, without cross-reactivity to other proteins. Although capture antibodies or aptamers are analyzed for cross reactivity, they are often tested against a restricted panel of antigens. Method testing and validation of these multiplex immunoassays are critical but few studies have examined performance of these assays in detail [41]. Indeed, we recently compared a bead-based and an aptamer-based affinity assay and found poor correlation in relative plasma protein quantification between the two assays [45]. This highlights the discrepancies introduced when using different assays, which will limit the comparison and validation of potential biomarkers in independent studies. In fact, although there have been several promising circulating biomarkers identified using affinity-based profiling approaches, these have not been validated. For instance, high serum levels of VEGF (more than 43 pg/ml) at baseline was associated with decreased overall survival in stage IV metastatic melanoma patients",

The detection of tumor markers is crucial for managing cancer, making treatment decisions, and monitoring disease progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) are key targets in cervical cancer therapy and valuable biomarkers in predicting treatment response and prognosis. In this study, we found that combining the measurement of VEGF and soluble PDL-1 can be used for diagnosing and evaluating the progression of cervical cancer. To explore a more convenient approach for detecting and assessing cervical cancer, we designed and prepared an engineered fd bacteriophage, a human-safe viral nanofiber, equipped with two peptides targeting VEGF and PD-L1. The dual-display phage nanofiber specifically recognizes and binds to both proteins. Utilizing this nanofiber as a novel capture agent, we developed a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. This method shows significantly enhanced detection sensitivity compared to conventional ELISA methods, which use either anti-VEGF or anti-PD-L1 antibodies as capture agents. Therefore, the phage dual-display nanofiber presents significant potential in detecting cancer markers, evaluating medication efficacy, and advancing immunotherapy drug development. Key points \u2022 The combined measurement of VEGF and soluble Programmed Death-Ligand 1(sPD-L1) demonstrates an additive effect in the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Fd phage nanofibers have been ingeniously engineered to display peptides that bind to VEGF and PD-L1, enabling the simultaneous detection of both proteins within a single assay \u2022 Genetically engineered phage nanofibers, adorned with two distinct peptides, can be utilized for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and can be mass-produced cost-effectively through bacterial infections \u2022 Employing dual-display fd phage nanofibers as capture probes, the phage ELISA method exhibited significantly enhanced detection sensitivity compared to traditional sandwich ELISA. Furthermore, phage ELISA facilitates the detection of a single protein or the simultaneous detection of multiple proteins, rendering them powerful tools for protein analysis and diagnosis across various fields, including cancer research Graphical Abstract",

            "text": "The selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries thus offers the potential to access very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and cheaply, avoiding the need for animal immunizations. The scFv can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs as described above. Such phage antibodies can be coated directly onto metal, plastic, silica or carbon surfaces by simple adsorption, which, as discussed above, is adequate for biosensor-based assays. \n\nViruses are pervasive life forms that need a host to reproduce. From bacteria to plants and animals to viruses, a wide variety of organisms may become infected. The genome, which is represented by double-or single-stranded DNA or RNA, and the capsid are the two primary structural parts of viruses. A small number of proteins encoded by the viral genome are present in numerous copies to create the extremely symmetrical capsid [216]. Methods for virus detection are employed in contemporary virological research for a variety of applications. They can be used in epidemiology to track and manage pandemic outbreaks of illnesses caused by viruses, including swine flu, SARS-CoV-2, and many others. Diagnostic virus detection methods are central in controlling the spread of viruses and help contain viral infections. Despite its drawbacks, the use of PCR to identify particular viral genomic sequences while an infection is still active is still regarded as the best virus detection technique. However, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are very promising because antibodies generated by phage display are an excellent alternative to classical antibodies. Since its development in 1985, phage display has been a crucial and successful molecular biology technique that has remained essential for the scientific community. A phage library may include millions, or perhaps billions, of distinct and distinctive mapping peptide ligands because a huge number of nucleotide fragments can be cloned into the phage genome. The epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the bacteriophage surface, which constitute the basis for phage display, have been exploited in affinity selection-based biopanning to screen for potential novel vaccine candidates [77]. \n\nPhage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap.",

            "text": "Manon Nuytten from UCLouvain then discussed the use of phages as a diagnostic tool, here for the development of Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) based on phage proteins. LFAs, widely employed in point-of-care testing (e.g., COVID-19 self-test), are crucial in various fields but face limitations with traditional antibodies, such as variability in specificity and stability, and high costs. Phage proteins, involved in processes like adsorption and lysis, can serve as alternative bioreceptors for LFAs, but the understanding of their interface interactions is lacking. The emergence of precise bioinformatics tools such as AlphaFold2 has significantly facilitated the microstructural characterization and engineering of phage proteins, ultimately improving the performance of phage-based biosensors. In her talk, Manon Nuytten focused on the Bacillus cereus group which includes pathogenic species, emphasizing the importance of their rapid detection in the agro-food sector to prevent food poisoning. Through in silico analysis of phage affinity proteins targeting B. cereus used in an LFA format, the study identified regions involved both in the binding to LFA interfaces and bacterial cells, contributing to the optimization of protein performance in these tests. \n\nThe final presentation of the conference was delivered by Johan Quintens from V\u00e9sale Biosciences, a Belgian biotech established in 2018, focusing on personalized phage-based therapies. He outlined the four key pillars that underpin their efforts to offer successful phage therapy in the near future. The first pillar involves the development of a phagogram (Luminophage \u00ae ) to determine the targeted bacteria's sensitivity to a collection of phages, facilitating the selection of the most suitable phage. The second key point emphasized by Johan Quintens is the importance of maintaining a library of active phages against pathogens present in Western European hospitals, particularly targeting multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. To achieve this, various networks of European and international partners have been established to ensure a comprehensive collection of phages and multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.",

The identification of specific molecular biomarkers for these subtypes would be a valuable contribution to a more precise diagnosis and to the development of individualized therapies to different molecular subgroups. \n\nHowever, the quest for molecular biomarkers specific for cancer cells remains a challenge due to the lack of affinity reagents that can specifically bind to unique molecular targets on the surface of the these cells. The isolation and identification of such reagents is vital for clinical applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy [11]. Evolutionary screening techniques, such as phage display [12], have demonstrated incredible capacity to identify affinity reagents for a wide variety of targets (proteins, nucleic acids, inorganic materials, cells, among others) [13,14]. In fact, phage display has already been used to generate recombinant antibody fragments that specifically recognize breast cancer subpopulations [15], as well as cell-targeting peptides for SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells [16]. In addition, phage display does not require prior knowledge of the cell surface, has low costs, and the cell-specific peptides identified typically present low immunogenicity [17,18]. \n\nIn this work, we used phage display to identify peptides specifically recognizing the claudin-low breast cancer cell line MDA-MD-231. The identification of such peptides could open new perspectives for the development of targeted therapies against this specific breast cancer subtype. Binding assays were performed to select the most specific peptides and a bioinformatics analysis was implemented to evaluate their potential targets on the cell surface.",

            "text": "The identification and selection of epitopes play a crucial role in the development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic antibodies. Various techniques are available for this purpose, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, peptide arrays, site-directed mutagenesis, bioinformatics and computational modeling, and phage display. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and the type of epitope or mimotope under investigation. Among these techniques, phage display stands out due to its simplicity in epitope selection and screening. Moreover, the resulting phagosomes can be used as vaccines without requiring additional manipulation. \n\nTo successfully select epitopes or mimotopes using phage display, several important steps must be carefully executed. Firstly, a phage display library is needed to facilitate the selection of target epitopes. These libraries can either be constructed in-house or obtained as pre-made libraries, such as those provided by New England Biolabs. There are two main types of libraries commonly used: random phage display peptide libraries (RPL) and gene or genome fragment libraries (GFL). Each type of library has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the specific research question, the nature of the target protein, and the available resources. \n\nObtaining the appropriate source of antibodies is another critical aspect when selecting epitopes for the library. These antibodies can be derived from patients who are recovering from an infectious disease or individuals who have been immunized with a vaccine. It's important to note that these antibodies need to undergo purification using protein A/G affinity chromatography or antigen-based chromatography, if the antigen is available, to ensure that selection is not biased against other components present in the samples. However, it should be acknowledged that serum samples typically contain polyclonal antibodies, which necessitates a screening assay following the selection process. \n\nBefore commencing the selection or biopanning process, two protocols must be prepared and optimized. The first protocol involves biopanning the library, wherein a pool of phage clones recognized by the antibodies is selected. The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay.",

            "text": "Serum tumor markers have the potential of being incorporated into diagnostic and therapeutic practice in breast cancer [22][23][24][25][26]. Potential usages of the markers include early detection or screening, differentiation of benign from malignant disease, histological differentiation, and defining prognosis. These goals have generated considerable interests in identifying predictive tumor markers over the past three decades [27,28].\n\nBesides CA 15-3 and CA 27.29, other breast tumor biomarkers have been identified. The most extensively investigated circulating biomarkers include MAGE family members, NY-ESO-1, HER-2/neu, MUC1, mutant p53, c-myc, BRCA1, and BRCA2. Depending on the stage and histology of disease, the percentage of breast cancer patients who have elevated serum protein levels of any one of the above markers is less than 36%, and combination of these markers ranges from 20% to 73% [22]. As such, the clinical application of these markers is limited when assayed independently, although using combinations of markers has somewhat enhanced diagnostic value [22]. Similarly, an antibody response to a single protein is not expected to be a universal marker [29][30][31][32].\n\nIn the present study, we interrogated a breast cancer cDNA T7 phage library with antibodies in patient sera to identify aber-  Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicates the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers; the highest area = 1. a These phageexpressed proteins showed no statistical significance in distinguishing patient samples from normal samples either individually or in combination.\n\nrantly expressed tumor proteins in breast cancer.

            "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

            "text": "Affinity ligands are important tools for the advancement of various biomedical technologies, such as advanced therapeutics, targeted delivery, and microscopy. While antibodies have historically been the most frequently employed affinity ligands, a number of exciting applications have emerged for peptides as affinity ligands due to their useful and unique properties. For example, peptides (mimotopes), selected for binding to soluble antibodies, have been used for the discovery of disease-related epitopes, and provide the potential for vaccine development without requiring information about the etiological agent or its antigens [1]. Peptides capable of recognizing changes in the binding region of analyte-bound antibodies have also been used in high sensitivity biosensors for the detection of small molecules [2]. Finally, their ease of chemical synthesis and amino acid modification can provide peptides with higher bioavailability and resistance to proteolysis, thereby improving their stability and performance in in vivo studies. \n\nThe ability to generate and screen large genetically-encoded antibody/peptide libraries, displayed on either viruses or cells, has matured over the past 25 years and is now one of the primary in vitro methods used to select antibody or peptide ligands to almost any antigen of interest [3]. Like antibody fragments, peptide ligands are typically selected from large filamentous phage display libraries. However, since peptides selected from na\u00efve libraries usually have low affinities and, due to their smaller size, are more easily influenced by their context (e.g. display platform), their selection benefits from high display efficiency, library purity (i.e., lack of contaminating wild type M13 phage), and the ability to eliminate display bias. Efficiency and purity are the two main attributes addressed in the work we describe here. \n\nM13 bacteriophage is a flexible filamentous bacterial virus containing single stranded DNA packaged within a few thousand copies of p8, the major coat protein, and 3-5 copies of each of the four minor coat proteins (p3, p6, p7 and p9). By modification of the phage genome, it is possible to efficiently express polypeptides fused to phage coat proteins and build libraries of enormous complexity.",

            "text": "The objective of this work was to elucidate methods whereby single domain antibodies (sdAb) could be integrated into field-deployable rapid hand-held diagnostic and detection assays. A lateral flow assay is a simple-to-use diagnostic device for determining the presence or absence of target analytes, such as pathogens or contaminants in water supplies. The most commonly known type of lateral flow assay is the pregnancy test. Rapid, low cost, portable, and easy to use, lateral flow assays are used in biomedicine, agriculture, food and environmental sciences [1]; they are currently the basis for most rapid tests for COVID-19 [2]. Lateral flow assays require that the recognition elements be adsorbed to both a membrane, typically made of nitrocellulose, and to colloidal gold nanoparticles. An alternative format for rapid assays that has been demonstrated for the multiplexed and sensitive detection of biothreat agents, is the vertical flow assay (VFA) which also requires recognition elements adsorbed to both a membrane and gold nanoparticles [3]. Antibodies, which are routinely employed as the recognition elements for these tests, must form stable interactions with the surfaces while retaining their binding activity. \n\nSdAb, also known as nanobodies or VHH, are the recombinantly produced binding domains derived from the unique heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids [4,5]. Like conventional antibodies, sdAb provide sensitive and specific binding to target analytes, but are only 1/10 the size. Advantages of sdAb include the ability to refold and bind antigen after denaturation, to bind hidden epitopes, to be readily produced in bacterial or yeast systems, and to be engineered for specific applications [6,7]. SdAb have been developed towards an ever-growing list of high value targets, and they are being utilized for a number of therapeutic and detection applications [8][9][10]. \n\nThe methods and materials for lateral and vertical flow assays have traditionally been optimized for conventional antibodies.",

            "text": "These molecules play a vital role as diagnostic tools where they ensure efficient management of diseases. Faced with an epidemic, a timely and thorough diagnosis is key in the wait of development and distribution of vaccinations or therapeutics [30]. By specific detection of proteins or other molecules, antibodies aid in recognition of infections and allergies besides factoring in the measurement of hormones and other biological markers. MAbs are indispensable in the diagnosis of pathologies and fundamental laboratory investigation as these proteins have the edge of specificity to be able to bind to specific antigenic epitopes, which facilitate prompt assessment of molecular phenotype of various tissues [31].\n\nAt present, mAbs are extensively used in technologies such as immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. As antibodies are immune proteins, marking the evolution of the host immune system response to an infection, they are measured in a sensitive and specific way to provide a record of recent and previous infections [32]. It is superior to pathogen detection, which is only done transiently whereas antibody markers are more durable [32]. Having various advantages, including their drug safety profiles, technological advancements, development and market success are just some grounds behind its acceptance in diagnostic use [33]. Some of the latest diagnostic assays are for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These tests can detect specific biomarkers, which in this case are immunoglobulins IgM and IgG which are synthesised by the host B cells in response to infection. Some examples include chemiluminescent IA, manual ELISA, as well as rapid lateral flow IA [34].\n\nHowever, in serological tests, the usage of antibodies can be traded with antibody fragments. synthesised human single-chain variable fragments (scFv) present numerous pros compared to their traditional antibody counterparts, such as reduced molecular mass, as well as enhanced thermal stability, solubility, and dispersion, besides being an antigen substitute when antigen collection is unavailable [35]. Furthermore, an antigen binding fragment (Fab) is another alternative to scFv. A Fab synthetic phage display library can be constructed as a promising tool for diagnosis to detect a selection of mAbs acting on different epitopes [36]. Alternative antibody formats do not rely on",

            "text": "However, unlike nucleic acid detection methods, post-translation modifications of proteins can complicate the detection of clinically-relevant biomarkers [16]. \n\nAntibodies are the primary tool used as recognition reagents to detect biomarkers, and are widely used as analytical tools in clinical settings. For immunodiagnostics, antibodies are now exploited as binders for antigen of interest in a range of platforms, including the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), immunoblotting (Western Blotting), immunocytochemistry, and the immunoprecipitation assay [17,18]. With the help of sophisticated instruments, antibodies are also used as tools for protein microarrays, flow cytometric analysis, and immunoaffinity analysis [19][20][21]. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies are widely used as a main source of antibodies in rapid diagnostic tests for detecting various infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, HIV and so on. Antibodies can be isolated from a range of sources, with plasma and serum being the most common sources in laboratory practice [22]. Furthermore, alternative sources, such as chicken egg yolk, have been used to produce functional antibodies against certain biomarkers [23]. Antibodies have also been used as therapeutic agents and animal models such as mice, rabbits, horses and guinea pig are critical to the development of therapeutic antibodies [24]. \n\nSmall-molecule antibodies are postulated to have better solubility capability [25,26]. Nowadays, the shrinking of intact immunoglobulin into smaller antibody fragments such as scFv, Fv, Fab and dual or tetra-domain fragments has become possible via molecular engineering approaches (Figure S1) [27,28]. An advantage of small antibody fragments is their ease of genetic manipulation due to their smaller size, ease of expression in bacterial systems, and low lot-to-lot variation, and in scaled-up production [29][30][31]. Moreover, the desired antibody fragment repertoire can also be developed from any animal immunoglobulin with an appropriate set of specific primers [32,33].",

            "text": "The recent advances in antibody-antigen screening and development technologies have largely contributed to the sensitivity and specificity of antibody-antigen-based diagnostic platforms. These improvements have been critical for detecting protein biomarkers that are associated with various diseases, with many modern methods incorporating fluorescent components to achieve higher performance metrics. For instance, Iwanaga et al. showed that an all-dielectric meta surface can contribute to the sensitivity of fluorescent sensing, demonstrating an efficient fluorescent sensing-based platform able to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) at extremely low concentrations, in the picogram per milliliter or femtomolar range. The results of this study indicated that the presence of meta surface fluorescence biosensors provided a highly sensitive platform that is better than commercially standard ELISA assays [13]. While the all-dielectric meta surface system demonstrates impressive sensitivity and specificity, current limitations include scalability, cost, and complexity of integrating microfluidics and optics into real-world clinical workflows. Moreover, the potential issues with nonspecific adsorption, limited dynamic range, and the need for extensive clinical validation indicate that further refinements are necessary before widespread adoption. Additionally, modifications to other diagnostic platforms have shown substantial improvements in the limit of detection (LOD) within context of disease biomarkers. Panferov et al. demonstrated an electrophoretic assembly lateral flow immunoassay that has a 1000-fold improvement in the LOD of serological paper-based assays. This method, which utilizes a 9-volt battery, is designed for ease of use by individuals with minimal training, requiring only a small 3 \u00b5L specimen of finger-prick capillary blood [14]. \n\nAlthough the electrophoresis-based platform significantly enhances sensitivity, the presence of complex biological matrices, background immunoglobulin, and real-world sample variability may still pose considerable challenges For disease recognition, B\u00fcy\u00fcks\u00fcnet\u00e7i et al. developed an electronano diagnostic platform for detecting the Influenza A virus, utilizing anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody interactions in conjunction with multi-walled carbon nanotube gold-platinum hybrid nanomaterials.",

As shown in Table 1, over 40 biological drugs or drug candidates were discovered using phage display. Five are approved drugs (4 antibodies and 1 peptide), and an additional 3 antibody-based candidates (trebananib, ramucirumab and necitumumab) are in Phase 3 development for the treatment of various cancers. Of these, completion of Phase 3 studies (either primary or estimated study completion) of both ramucirumab (NCT01170663, NCT00917384, NCT00703326) and necitumumab (NCT00981058, NCT00982111) are estimated for 2013. \n\nMost of the phage display candidates in Table 1 are antibodies or antibody derivatives, with ecallantide (Kalbitor\u00ae), Xyntha purification peptide, and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386) being the exceptions. While peptide-based therapeutics are clinically promising due to their small size and established manufacturing processes, their short half-life initially limited their potential as therapeutic strategies. Advances in protein engineering such as peptide cyclization, use of fusion proteins (e.g., the Fc fragment), unnatural amino acids and conjugation to polyethylene glycol and polysialic acids have mitigated some of these limitations. 83 As a consequence, there has been a recent re-emergence of peptidebased therapeutics development. 8 With the power and versatility of phage display, it is likely that phage display will continue to provide candidate peptides for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. 84,85 necdotal evidence has been used to support the hypothesis that a higher percentage of mAbs selected from synthetic or semisynthetic phage libraries have lower solubility profiles compared with murine hybridoma antibodies. 86 However, this phenomenon, if true, is easily overcome by employing a variety of techniques. Screening library outputs using a combination of cross interaction chromatography and dynamic light scattering have proven effective as early solubility screening techniques. 87",

Michael Kierny and Thomas Cunningham contributed equally In the search for biomarkers, recombinant affinity reagents can be generated to candidate proteins or post-translational modifications that differ qualitatively or quantitatively between normal and diseased tissues. The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of \u2018Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\u2019 (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers. Such devices may soon replace the traditional time consuming ELISAs and Western blots, and deliver rapid, point-of-care diagnostics to market.",

            "text": "The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of monoclonal antibodies is a promising recombinant nanostructure for various medical applications, including bioimaging and targeted therapy. While numerous scFv antibodies against eukaryotic cell surface proteins (especially cancer biomarkers) have been generated and engineered to suit various purposes, only a few specific scFv against bacterial cell surfaces have been developed, especially those of human origin. Recent incidents of emerging multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria and the realization of the importance of a balanced microbiota on the health of the host has led to more interests in the development of recombinant antibacterial antibodies as a detection probe or targeted therapy for bacterial infections. This study reports the generation of two specific human antibacterial scFv using phage display antibody technology. The recombinant scFv fragments of about 30 kDa and a diameter of 5 nm were produced and purified from engineered Escherichia coli that can enhance cytosolic disulfide bond formation. As a proof of principle, Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as model Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Specificity at the strain and species level to both planktonic and biofilm forms of these bacteria were demonstrated in various assay formats, namely, ELISA, flow cytometry, western blot, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy via the hexa-histidine tag. This recombinant scFv generation platform can be applied for other bacteria, and since the scFv obtained has a benefit of being a human origin, it could be conveniently engineered for various therapeutic or theranostic applications with minimized adverse immunoreaction.",

            "text": "The detection of antigen-specific antibodies in human specimens via serology remains an essential and fundamental necessity in laboratory medicine and therapeutic and vaccine development. Antibody serology is used in the diagnosis of hundreds of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, and new biomarkers and tests continue to expand the utility of serology. Nevertheless, antibody serologic tests frequently exhibit suboptimal performance characteristics as measured by clinical sensitivity and specificity, require subjective interpretation 1 , and/or depend upon multi-step algorithms 2,3 . Serologic assays using whole cell material and antigen mixtures can have high false positive rates, leading to unnecessary follow-up tests, inappropriate treatments, or misdiagnosis of patients. Antibody serologic methods typically provide a narrow view of immunity towards a single, or small number of antigens or organisms, while an estimated 1400 pathogens may cause human disease 4 . And, many of these diseases lack effective serology tests altogether. Furthermore, many tests remain organism or antigen-based, even though knowledge of which antigen epitopes are targeted can be critical for inferring infection stage 5 , reactivation 6 , and immune protection 7 . \n\nDespite biomedical need, methods have not emerged to broadly analyze antibody repertoire composition to enable multiplex serology for infection, allergy, or autoimmunity. Multiplex serology is typically limited to several organisms, and to only a small subset of their immunogenic epitopes 8,9 , even though infection or vaccination can give rise to hundreds of distinct antibody species 10 . To expand the breadth and information content of parallel immunoassays, pathogen-proteome derived phage display libraries and planar peptide arrays have been developed. For example, a phage display library of 93,904, 56-mer peptides spanning 208 human virus proteomes was constructed 11,12 . Following immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing, seropositivity towards each virus was inferred. However, comprehensive proteome tiling for many higher complexity organisms is currently impractical given their larger proteome size.",

            "text": "Rapid and precise diagnostic techniques are essential for identifying foodborne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), which poses significant challenges to food safety. Traditional detection methods are limited by long incubation times and high costs. In this context, gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based lateral flow assays (LFAs) are emerging as valuable tools for rapid screening. However, the use of antibodies in LFAs faces challenges, including complex production processes, ethical concerns, or variability. Here, we address these challenges by proposing an innovative approach using bacteriophage-derived proteins for pathogen detection on LFAs. We used the engineered endolysin cell-wall-binding domain (CBD) and distal tail proteins (Dit) from bacteriophages that specifically target B. cereus. The protein-binding properties, essential for the formation of efficient capture and detection biointerfaces in LFAs, were extensively characterized from the microstructural to the LFA device level. Machine-learning models leverage knowledge of the protein sequence to predict advantageous protein orientations on the nitrocellulose membrane and AuNPs. The study of the biointerface binding quantified the degree of attachment of AuNPs to bacteria, providing, for the first time, a microscopic model of the number of AuNPs binding to bacteria. It highlighted the binding of up to one hundred 40 nm AuNPs per bacterium in conditions mimicking LFAs. Eventually, phage proteins were demonstrated as efficient bioreceptors in a straightforward LFA prototype combining the two proteins, providing a rapid colorimetric response within 15 min upon the detection of 105B. cereus cells. Recombinantly produced phage binding proteins present an opportunity to generate a customizable library of proteins with precise binding capabilities, offering a cost-effective and ethical alternative to antibodies. This study enhances our understanding of phage protein biointerfaces, laying the groundwork for their utilization as efficient bioreceptors in LFAs and rapid point-of-care diagnostic assays, thus potentially strengthening public health measures.",

            "text": "Combined with other proteomic techniques, these phage-scFvs can be applied to membrane proteome analysis and, subsequently, identification of novel tumor-related antigens mediating proliferation and differentiation of cells. Furthermore, such antibody fragments can be exploited for diagnostic purposes as well as targeted drug delivery of GC. \n\nhybridoma-derived antibodies, antibody fragments are considered more appropriate probes in antibody arrays for analyzing thousands of proteins in parallel due to their rapid production and manipulation. 7 The integration of PDT with proteomics can be used for simultaneous identification of disease-related biomarkers and the discovery of therapeutic antibodies. 8 In phage antibody libraries, antibody variable regions are ligated in-frame to a filamentous phage coat protein gene in a phagemid vector. After transformation into a proper E. coli host, the antibody fragment-displaying phage particles are produced through infection with a helper phage and prepared for the selection process known as 'panning' . Panning is the successive rounds of selection which specifically enriches candidate binders with desired properties via incubation of library with the target antigen, washing out the nonspecific binders, elution to retrieve the specific binders, and finally, amplification in bacteria to prepare for the next round of selection. Isolation of specific antibody clones will provide access to the antibody-encoding genes. Based on the intended application, various types of panning methods have been so far employed such as solid-phase selection on an immobilized purified antigen, solutionphase selection with a biotinylated antigen, and whole cell panning (WCP) using prokaryotic or mammalian cells. Mammalian WCP utilizes intact cells in monolayers or suspension for selection of antibodies against the native three-dimensional structure of membrane antigens in the presence of a lipid bilayer. 9 1][12][13][14] In contrast, the expression of membrane proteins in aqueous media, in both solid and solution phase selections may cause conformational alterations and/or aggregation, and consequently, the binders may recognize the epitopes that are naturally masked in the native form.",

However, when diagnostic applications are considered, such techniques have major disadvantages, including limited availability, high costs, time consumption, and labor-intensive nature. They do not offer quantitative measurement of MPs in sensitive and reliable high-throughput assay formats. To tackle these challenges, antibodies raised against cell surface biomarkers are extensively used for cellular phenotyping, functional studies, and assessing expression profiles of MPs. In diagnostics, almost all hematopoietic diseases, for example, are detected using a panel of antibodies against a cluster of differentiation (CD) specificities, along with many other molecular imaging agents [5,40]. Antibodies are also used for the detection of CTCs based on the expression of epithelial markers, such as EpCAM [41,42]. However, this antibody-based approach can be limited as CTCs can lose their epithelial characteristics (e.g., EpCAM downregulation) due to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and can have antigen expression profiles that are shared with normal cells [29]. In this case, neither can antibodies detect CTCs nor discriminate between malignant and benign cells. \n\nFlow cytometry is one of the most widely used and accessible antibody-based diagnostic methods to evaluate cell surface biomarkers [43]; other antibody-based technologies include Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and tissue immunostaining [44]. Although immunoassays can be highly efficient and sensitive in detecting cell surface biomarkers, they have some limitations, including high cost, risks of interferences, the need for quality controls, labor-intensiveness, the requirement for special expertise and instrumentation, difficulties in quantifying MPs, and the inaccessibility to MPs as possible targets. \n\nBiological sensors, on the other hand, have become ubiquitous platforms in many areas of applied sciences, including clinical diagnostics.",

However, comparison of lateral flow tests reveals very low sensitivity, in practice lower than the sensitivity declared by the manufacturer, and in the case of complex samples, such as environmental and clinical samples, the lateral flow assay often suffers from interference from particle components in the tested samples [73,76]. \n\nA luminescent adenylate cyclase assay for detection of active edema factor in B. anthracis culture was developed [78]. The assay is based on the EF-dose response decrease in luminescence, which may be specifically reverted by anti-EF antibodies. The assay enables not only identification of B. anthracis in cultures but also gives information about expression of one of the key pathogenicity factors of these bacteria. \n\nImmunological methods are also used for anthrax diagnostics to identify cellular immunity developed post infection. However, these methods are useful for retrospective diagnostics because several days are needed to develop specific antibodies during the infection. The most common method for detection and quantification of an antibody immune response is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was developed for the detection of antibodies against various antigens, such as protective antigen [79], capsular antigen [80], and lethal factor [81]. Chitlaru et al. [82] generated a list of 84 in vivo-expressed B. anthracis immunogens that can be used in serodiagnostics and vaccine development. \n\nRecently, Bar-Haim et al. [83] proposed a novel approach of diagnostics based on cellular reactivity of host cells with specific pathogen antigens. In this cell-based activation immunoassay the presence of interferon-gamma-producing (IFN\u03b3-producing) activated cells might be detected in peripheral blood samples 3-5 days earlier than serum antibodies. \n\nAs an alternative to detection of specific antibodies, detection of B. anthracis biomarkers in clinical samples has been proposed [84]. The biomarkers have been identified by the proteomic assay and might be detected in serum samples at 3 to 6 h post-infection in an animal model.",

Here, we decided to test CRC cDNA libraries displayed in T7 phages in microarray format for autoantibody screening in colorectal cancer patients' sera. The combination of both proteomic strategies should increase the number of candidate biomarkers and the diagnostic accuracy. Although screening of colorectal cancer sera with phage display libraries grown in Petri dishes was reported by Ran et al. (17), that screening was based on visual interpretation of antibody binding to nitrocellulose lifts of phage plaques using pooled sera, making objective quantification quite difficult.\n\nIn this report, we have used a T7 phage display system in combination with a microarray format to survey the humoral response in colorectal cancer patients. We have discovered and validated a new set of TAAs. One of the TAA candidates, MST1/STK4, was previously identified with commercial highdensity full-length protein microarrays, indicating a significant concordance between both assays. By ELISA, we tested either phages or the recombinant homologous proteins with cancer and reference sera, including controls and different types of cancer, to validate the diagnostic assays in CRC patients. The final TAA candidates showed a significant accuracy for CRC diagnosis.",

However, current quantitative tests for calprotectin are antibody-based and vary depending on the type of antibody and assay used. Additionally, the binding epitopes of applied antibodies are not characterized by structures and for most antibodies it is unclear if they detect calprotectin dimer, tetramer, or both. Herein, we develop calprotectin ligands based on peptides, that offer advantages such as homogenous chemical composition, heat-stability, site-directed immobilization, and chemical synthesis at high purity and at low cost. By screening a 100-billion peptide phage display library against calprotectin, we identified a high-affinity peptide (Kd\u2009=\u200926\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009nM) that binds to a large surface region (951 \u00c52) as shown by X-ray structure analysis. The peptide uniquely binds the calprotectin tetramer, which enabled robust and sensitive quantification of a defined species of calprotectin by ELISA and lateral flow assays in patient samples, and thus offers an ideal affinity reagent for next-generation inflammatory disease diagnostic assays.",

The conceptual principles of these methods are shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe SBA technology is run on a commercial platform provided by Luminex Corp. (Austin, Texas, USA), which measures relative protein plasma levels using a flow cytometer-based analysis of multiplexed suspension bead arrays of protein-specific antibodies ( Figure 1A).\n\nThe Luminex platform (FlexMAP3D) can analyze up to 500 proteins in 384 samples, using as little as 3 \u03bcl of plasma per sample run.\n\nHowever, reliability depends on the specificity and functionality of antibodies used and any findings should be orthogonally validated.\n\nAdvantages, compared with the current PEA and aptamer-based platforms, include full flexibility in designing custom antibody panels in a scalable fashion. 33,41 This technology platform has been used in proteomics studies for health assessment and various disease states, 33,42-44 including VTE. 22,23 The PEA technology platform (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) uses selected paired antibodies, labeled with complementary DNA linkers, for the recognition of proteins ( Figure 1B). A semiquantitative signal readout is generated either by quantitative polymerase chain reaction 39,45,46 or sequencing. 47 Conceptually, the application of dual antibodies targeting different neighboring epitopes increases specificity and reduces the risk that the signal reflects off-target binding.",

Detecting pathogens that have recently been present in a sample is essential for DNA-based testing to work. Toxins, antibodies, and genes that create toxins can be used to identify pathogens. Toxins, nucleic acids, and viruses are examples of pathogen detection targets. There are many biorecognition components to choose from, from antibodies to aptamers to imprinted polymers [12][13][14]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [15] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [16,17] have been extensively studied for the detection of infections. \n\nBecause of its high sensitivity and specificity, applicability in monitoring, early detection of biothreat agents, and antimicrobial resistance profiling, PCR technology (conventional and real-time PCR) is most frequently utilized in pathogen detection [18,19]. However, it has shortcomings, including the inability to distinguish between infections with identical genetic composition. For instance, when PCR has been used to identify Listeria monocytogenes [20] and Bacillus cereus [21], respectively, false signals of Listeria in-nocua and Bacillus thuringiensis have been recorded [22]. The inability of PCR to distinguish between the DNA of dead and living cells is another significant drawback, and this issue is crucial for the food sector, regulatory bodies, and the customer [19,22].",

            "text": "The field of medical diagnostics heavily relies on the identification and quantification of pathogens found in body fluids, including whole blood, stool, urine, mucus, saliva, or sputum. Diagnostic assays based on traditional bioanalytical techniques for detection of pathogens in body fluids are the gold standard and serve an essential role in healthcare by enabling the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Biosensors offer a complementary diagnostic platform that enable rapid and costeffective measurements, high sensitivity, and the ability to make measurements in complex matrices that pose challenges to traditional bioanalytical techniques. Studies suggest that rapid diagnostic testing can potentially reduce the chance of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization and antimicrobial use, and mortality rates (Barenfanger et al. 2000;Beekmann et al. 2003;Dierkes et al. 2009;Rappo et al. 2016). For example, repeated rapid screening programs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection is recommended as a means of increasing quality-adjusted life years of health for citizens in the United States (Paltiel et al. 2006). Additionally, the need for rapid antibody screening has been identified as an important aspect of mitigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSeveral comprehensive reviews have been published on traditional bioanalytical assays and biosensor-based assays for pathogen detection in medical diagnostics applications (Ahmed et al., 2014;da Silva et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2014). Common pathogens include the aforementioned foodborne, waterborne, and environmental pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium and Plasmodium spp.), as well as additional airborne and bloodborne pathogens. Pathogens such as Mycobacterium, HIV, and Plasmodium falciparum, represent some of the top causes of death from infectious diseases worldwide (WHO, 2018a). Other common pathogens associated with medical diagnostics applications include those that cause respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and diarrheal diseases, such as CD and MRSA, which can be life-threatening to the children, elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems. Other airborne and bloodborne pathogens of interest include the influenza virus, COVID",

            "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proven to be effective therapies in the treatment of a variety of cancers and autoimmune diseases. Because of this success, mAbs and related products are the fastest growing class of human therapeutics [1] and their use is being developed for other chronic indications such as osteoporosis [2] and hypercholesteremia [3]. MAbs also play an important role in biomarker validation and diagnostic assays [4]. \n\nHistorically, mAbs, including therapeutic mAbs, were generated by making hybridomas from mice immunized with the antigen of choice. The V H and V L regions were then engineered to produce chimeric or humanized mAbs that retain the specificity and affinity of the murine mAb, but impart more favorable properties of human antibodies, such as lower immunogenicity, improved half-life and effector function. Today, human mAbs are the predominant class of mAb entering clinical studies [5]. \n\nThe two most commonly used methods for production of human mAbs are hybridomas generated from mice expressing human antibody genes and phage display technologies [6]. Antibody production by hybridoma technology relies on immortalization of B-cells resulting in production of antibodies with cognate V L and V H gene pairs. On the other hand, antibody production by phage display technology leads to random pairing of V L and V H genes which may or may not represent physiological pairing configurations [7][8][9][10]. \n\nDespite utilization of random V L and V H gene pairs, phage display technology has gained popularity for development of therapeutic mAbs because it is a relatively simple process and requires less antigen and time compared to standard hybridoma technology [8,11]. Additionally, phage display technology is able to produce antibodies against a wide range of antigens, including weak or non-immunogenic, self, cell surface, and toxic antigens, which are difficult to develop by immunizing mice [8,12]. Phage display also allows for production of human antibodies without the need for humanized mice or concerns of Epstein-Barr virus or other potential pathogens present in human antibody-producing cell lines.",

            "text": "ELISA are robust and fast assays, able to screen large number of patients at once with good reproducibility and high sensitivity at low cost. However, as we showed in a recent comparative study, only high affinity antibodies are detected by SP-ELISA in Adalimumab treated rheumatoid arthritis patients 20 . Improved \"bridging\" ELISAs for detection of ADAbs are commercially available, however they are unable to differentiate between neutralizing Fv directed ADAbs and non-neutralizing ones 30 . As such, these assays are unable to detect clinically relevant ADAbs. This problem is mainly due to the antigen selection for ADAbs identification, as also observed and frequently reported for other diagnostic technologies. \n\nBiosensor based detection assays have the draw-back of requiring expensive equipment and offer lower throughput, as compared to ELISA assays, while at the same time they are more sensitive, when it comes to detection of different antibodies such as high and low affinity antibodies. RIA, whilst being less prone to Adalimumab level underestimation through inhibition of free Adalimumab or TNF-\u03b1 present in the patient sample, are limited due to the special sample handling and equipment required for managing radioactivity-based detection assays. In general, there are differences in detection of neutralizing ADAbs, which appear to be more relevant in the clinical setting. \n\nThus, we set out to design an Adalimumab derived peptide as antigenic probe, to be used in ELISA allowing improved ADAbs detection. Utilizing bioinformatic tools and approaches, a total of six new peptide sequences were derived from Adalimumab and three peptides were chosen from literature and used in an initial development cohort of patients for screening. Sequences were selected to exhibit maximum immunogenicity: peptides were chosen from CDR regions of Adalimumab combining different pieces of information, i.e., sequence analysis using Kabat rules, crystal structure analysis, T-cell epitope mapping, and classical epitope mapping data. As such, a simplified epitope mapping could be performed allowing for a faster and more economical development of peptides in comparison to large proteins and glycoproteins, while at the same time displaying lower heterogeneity of the final product.",

Since these methods are less sensitive, expensive, and time-consuming, extensive studies have been carried out to overcome these limitations and develop novel technology platforms for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases [11,13]. In this context, biosensors can be used as valuable, promising tools that meet the strong demand for the simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnosis of ADs with a better performance compared with that of complex methods of analysis. \n\nBiosensors are analytical devices composed of a biological element, a transducer, and a measurement device. This technology principally relies on a highly selective biological recognition between a bioreceptor and its target, thereby enabling the simple, continuous monitoring of this molecule. Based on the nature of the signal transducer, biosensors can be categorized into various types as follows: optical, electrochemical, thermometric, and piezoelectric systems [14]. In the field of ADs, biosensors can be used for disease diagnosis based on the detection of specific biomarkers using antibodies (Abs), antigens (Ags), and peptides as the recognition elements [15]. Studies have shown that biomarkers have different specificities in autoimmune diseases; some of them are associated with multiple diseases and others are disease-specific. Among these biomarkers, autoantibodies (AAbs) are considered to be the best diagnostic biomarkers that highly participate in the pathogenic process of disease development. Due to their specificity and stability during illness, AAbs can be used to diagnose, monitor, and assess disease severity [16,17]. In addition to AAbs, some chemokines, cytokines, and proteins are also used as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases [18,19]. \n\nIn this review, we summarize the most common ADs and their specific biomarkers that can be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of these diseases.",

The methodology links the genotype and phenotype of the peptides as each phage displays multiple copies of a peptide on its surface and contains the concomitant gene for the peptide within its genome. The display system allows the isolation of a particular peptide based on its binding activity to an antibody and in parallel the corresponding gene is also isolated. During traditional phage display methods the peptide library is propagated in bacteria and then bound to antibody that is usually immobilised on a solid support. The majority of non-binding phage are washed away and the bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH. A panning experiment generally includes several iterative rounds of binding-washing-elution steps. In between rounds, the sub-library of phage particles is again propagated within bacteria. Individual phage clones are then randomly selected and screened in a monoclonal phage assay, usually an ELISA. Any clones that display binding are then subjected to Sanger sequencing of the individual peptide genes. Peptide phage display has most often been applied to the epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies 5 and can be used to reveal epitopes recognised by disease-specific monoclonal antibodies, which can then be used to develop serological assays to detect infection. Conventional phage display techniques have also been applied to mapping the immunodominant epitopes of polyclonal sera. One of the most comprehensive examples of this evaluated responses in chickens immunised with the ectoparasite Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus 6 . This study revealed eight consensus motifs. Other examples include the identification of 4 immunodominant epitopes within ricin following immunisation of rabbits 7 and the identification seven peptides recognised during infection with Mycobacterium leprae 8 . Bachler and co-workers also applied phage display panning of a random peptide library to map the polyclonal antibody response to a multicomponent HIV vaccine and compared the epitopes recognised by antibodies from protected individuals to those without protection. They succeeded in mapping a neutralising epitope to a region within one of the vaccine peptides 9 . In an alternative phage display approach, the genome of Salmonella Typhimurium was displayed on",

These antibodies are described in the section \"recombinant antibodies against toxins.\" The majority of antibodies against bacteria are developed in order to facilitate diagnostics in patients [67,68] and environmental samples [69,70]. In general, cultural and microbial detection of bacteria is regarded as standard in diagnostics for many pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [71] or Salmonella Typhimurium [72]. Since these methods are often time-consuming and require experienced lab personal, high throughput analysis is often limited. Real-time PCR measurements have been developed for the diagnostics of many bacteria [73], offering high sensitivity and specificity of detection. But sample treatment is still needed in many cases, including expensive and complex laboratory devices [74]. An other approach is MS for diagnostic, but this technology needs expensive devices [75]. Antibody-based diagnostic like ELISA would be more simple and easy to use, also in developing countries. \n\nIn order to generate antibodies with the desired-binding properties, phage-display has been used to select antibodies on proteins or polysaccharides of Chlamydophila psittaci [76], Chlamydia trachomatis [77], Haemophilus influenzae [78], Listeria monocytogenes [79], Mycobaterium bovis [35], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [68,80,81], Porphyromonas gingivalis [67], Ralstonia solanacearum [69], Salmonella Typhimurium [2,82], and Yersinia pestis [83].

            "text": "Other less clinically developed technologies such as commercial protein arrays have the capacity to screen a large number of antigens but are not appropriate for routine diagnostics since the arrays have low sensitivity and high false positive rates.Other methods such as PhIP-Seq, an immunoprecipitation technology based on the phage-based display of large peptide libraries coupled with DNA sequencing of barcodes can be used for panoramic antibody profiling and discovery of antigens from viruses [6], bacteria [7], and humans [8].While PhIP-Seq and other immunoassay formats have been transformative for antibody discovery, these techniques require significant expertise, equipment, and time to process the samples and are not suitable for either rapid point-of-care or routine testing.\n\nBased on the evolving nature of multiple immunoassay formats, antibody detection technologies are on the threshold of undergoing major change, which will impact their application in clinical medicine.One first-generation non-ELISA immunoassay that employs genetically encoded luciferase fusion target proteins, Luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), provides a highly sensitive diagnostic and discovery platform for many different antibodies [9].More recently, several new second-generation methods based on split luciferase fusion proteins in a mix and read format have been developed that potentially can increase the utility and range of antibody testing.These new immunoassays are based on two or three split nanoluciferase recombinant fragments which, when reconstituted in the presence of specific antibodies generate measurable luciferase activity.The development of these newer split luciferase approaches suggests the potential for transformative opportunities for rapid, highly quantitative, and possibly high-capacity antibody profiling.In this review, we describe the technical details and applications of LIPS as well as the mechanics and results of the newer mix and read split luciferase assays and their potential uses for accelerating antibody measurement for clinical testing.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used extensively both for treatment and diagnostics. Phage display has been successfully used for isolation of many mAbs currently sold in the market. However, the main drawback is that it could result in a large number of false positives. In this study, we explored the feasibility of combination of two powerful antibody isolation techniques, phage display and Functional Ligand-binding Identification by Tat-based Recognition of Associating Proteins (FLI-TRAP), to identify nanobodies (Nbs) that are specific to HBsAg, an antigen commonly used for hepatitis B infection diagnostics. A synthetic camelized human nanobody library was subjected to 2 rounds of biopanning against HBsAg adr subtype, commonly found in southeast Asia. As expected, sequencing analysis of all 12 randomly selected clones from biopanning showed truncated Nbs, representing false positive. Full-length Nb genes were amplified from the phage eluted during the 2nd round of biopanning was subcloned into FLI-TRAP system for isolation. For evaluation, 16 clones were also randomly picked and submitted for sequencing analysis. Interestingly, 15 out of 16 clones had the same sequence and were full-length Nb, so C1 was used to represent these clones. C10, however, was truncated at framework 3. ELISA result of crude extract showed that C1 showed binding activity \u2248 4.5 fold higher than reference Nb and \u2248 1.46 fold lower than commercial purified monoclonal antibodies while its WB result showed that C1 had a higher protein yield than the reference Nb. C10 did not show ELISA signal nor was detected in WB, thus truncation was confirmed since the detection was performed using anti-FLAG antibody specific to FLAG epitope tag fused to the C-terminus of Nb. Nonetheless, our study demonstrated the feasibility to use FLI-TRAP after initial phage display screening to easily identify full-length Nbs. This combined platform would be powerful tool for easy isolation of Nb against new target as well as for affinity maturation.",

Through four cycles of refinement, a remarkable anti-idiotype VHH phage clone was isolated, and the LOD of PD-IPCR based on the VHH phage stood at an astonishing 6.5 pg/mL, surpassing phage ELISA by approximately 12-fold. The promise of high throughput analysis in practical applications became evident with the successful application of this method in ZEN detection of grain samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS). These groundbreaking studies collectively underscore the immense potential of anti-idiotype PD-IPCR methods, offering a gateway to ultra-sensitive mycotoxin detection in cereals. The utilization of PD-IPCR not only enhances sensitivity and expands the linear range compared to phage ELISA but has also been verified for ZEN detection in grain samples through LC-MS/MS validation. In addition to PCR-based analysis, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) represents another cutting-edge technique for the rapid and simple detection of target nucleic acids (150). The impact of this groundbreaking method is evident in a myriad of diagnostic fields, including bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogen Schematic diagram of the M13 phage vector used for clone library of VHH. The open reading frame of the V-domains from the heavy chain-only antibody was PCR amplification from lymphocytes in immunized animals. The PCR product was cloned into a phage vector downstream of the promoter, in the box upstream of epitope tags, and followed by the coding sequence for the M13 phage head capsid protein gIIIp. The phage was then transfected into Escherichia coli that could be read by codon. After infecting bacteria with helper phage, a library of recombinant phage particles was obtained from the supernatant (Adapted from [139]). detection (151, 152), as well as disease diagnosis (153).",

            "text": "Immunoassays are arguably the most heavily utilized quantitative pathogen detection platform [175,176]. These assays take advantage of the specificity of formation of an antibody-antigen complex, which is a result of the fact that such antibodies are produced based on a specific antigen. Therefore, in use within a diagnostic assay, a given antibody will remain specific to the antigen for which it was developed. As mentioned above, one of the most fundamental immunoassay techniques is the ELISA. There are several different ELISA types, including direct, competitive, and sandwich formats. The sandwich ELISA will likely be one of the primary immunoassay platforms employed on-chip given that it generally exhibits impressive sensitivity and specificity traits, along with favorable kinetics [176]. This assay, as it is traditionally performed, is presented in Figure  9.6. Basic schematic (minus the rinsing and blocking steps) for a traditional sandwich ELISA. In the first step (A), a capture antibody specific to the target antigen is attached to the surface of a microwell plate. This is followed with a rinsing step, a blocking step, and an additional rinsing step. Sample solution, containing target antigen, is added next, allowing for the target antigen to bind to the capture antibody (B). After an additional rinsing step, a detection antibody, which is generally covalently bound to an enzyme, is introduced and allowed to selectively bind to the captured target antigen (C). Finally, after a last rinse, a substrate molecule is added and converted into a product molecule via the bound enzyme (D). This product molecule is utilized as a means of detecting and quantifying the target antigen.\n\nELISA assays have become commonplace within diagnostics and have been tailored to a wide variety of detection targets. These assays are designed to detect an antigen directly associated with the pathogen or an an-tigen/antibody produced within a host system as a result of the invasion of the pathogen. Several examples include the detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 [113,177,178], exotoxins from Salmonella and Clostridium botulinum [179,180], and Helicobacter pylori [117].",

Most of this research is directed toward the detection of food-borne pathogens in various food matrices. 15,17 Although the complexity of food matrices is entirely different to clinical specimens, there is no reason why these same technologies cannot be adapted to the clinical arena. Different versions of reporter phages based on luciferase (bacterial and firefly), green fluorescent protein (GFP), \u03b2-galactosidase, and ice nucleation protein have been developed for a wide variety of pathogens such as L. monocytogenes, 97,154 Salmonella species, [155][156][157][158] and E. coli O157:H7. 159,160 For the latter pathogen, the authors developed a bioreporter quorum sensing system in which the E. coli phage was engineered with the gene encoding acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) as opposed to luciferase. Upon infection of the target E. coli, AHL is produced and diffuses out of the cell. In the presence of a bioreporter harboring the luxRCDABE gene cassette, AHL interacts with the LuxR protein which stimulates transcription of luxRCDABE, resulting in bioluminescence, without the need for exogenously added aldehyde substrate. 2][163] Binding of the fluorescently labeled phage to specific receptors on the cell wall can be detected and measured using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry or fluorescent plate readers. \n\nBecause of the natural specificity of phages for their hosts, phage or phage components are also being used as capture elements, thus eliminating the need of producing costly antibodies or developing synthetic recognition molecules. Phages O1, P1, and T4 have been used as the recognition agents in an ELISA plate assay for the detection of S. enterica, and E. coli with a sensitivity of 10 6 CFU/mL. 164",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a FARA pathogen-classification approach using a wellcharacterized virus system. Three reovirus strains and one phage were successfully classified by performing sequential antibody-binding assays directed by the decision tree. The structure of the decision tree was based on published characteristics of each virus strain and the known specificity of each antibody. Because the capture antibodies were arrayed at known locations along the filament, and the fluorescence of the detection antibodies was measured as a function of filament location, an increase in filament fluorescence at a particular location indicated antibody interaction with the virus. For each virus strain tested, the expected fluorescence peaks were observed, and the correct classification was made. Moreover, successful transit of all decision tree branches was demonstrated. \n\nThe biochemical components of FARA are similar to those used in standard ELISAs. Both assays create a dual-antibody sandwich that results in similar detection limits for M13K07 for FARA and ELISA. 10 One of the virus-specific antibodies acts as the capture antibody, and the second acts as the detecting antibody. The main difference in the biochemistry of the two assays is that, in the current implementation of FARA, enzyme amplification is not utilized. Like ELISA, FARA utilizes antibodies adsorbed to the surface of a substrate to capture virus from solution. The capacity of bound antibody to retain its antigenbinding activity is essential to the success of both assays. Each of the immobilized test antibodies in our system retained functionality and bound its corresponding virus (Fig. 4). The absence of peaks in the negative-control positions and in positions occupied by antibodies not specific to the test virus demonstrates minimal cross reactivity in the FARA platform employed in this study. \n\nWe chose reovirus as a test system to show clinical relevance and to avoid potential safety concerns in the laboratory. Reovirus has been used as a model to study mechanisms of viral pathogenesis in mice. 14 Although it is a human pathogen, it is rarely associated with human disease. 11 Many reovirus field-isolate strains have been characterized, 4,7,8 and a broad array of antibodies are available that recognize reovirus with varying specificity. 12",

            "text": "A biosensor is defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as an independent, integrated device that may gather data by making direct spatial contact between a biological recognition component (biochemical receptor) and a transduction element [103]. When obtaining analytical data, IUPAC also highlights the need to differentiate biosensors from more comprehensive bioanalytical systems [103]. The development of biosensors has accelerated in recent years, especially for applications in health and the environment where biomarkers are used for predictive or diagnostic purposes. Recent reviews have collated the list of biosensors development for cardiac biomarkers [19,104]. Membrane receptors, oligonucleotides, aptamers, enzymes, and whole cells are examples of biochemical receptors in biosensors. Similar to their use in ELISA assays, particular antibodies are most frequently used for the detection of cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin, D-dimers, and BNP. A variety of transduction approaches are then used to transform the biorecognition event into a quantifiable physical signal [105]. \n\nCommon transduction techniques include mechanical techniques, such as detecting mass changes on mechanical resonators, as in quartz microbalance systems; optical techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance setups that measure changes in the refractive index of the bioactive layer upon biomarker binding; and electrical techniques, such as measuring the electrical charges of biomarkers with transistors or nanowires. Although many transduction pathways have been investigated for the detection of cardiac biomarkers, electrochemical and optical techniques continue to be the most popular and thoroughly studied. Utilizing micro-and nanotechnology, biosensors facilitate point-of-care testing at the patient's bedside by facilitating simple prototyping and portability. However, even though several biosensors are supplied as benchtop devices, not all of them are portable. Since biosensors have the potential to achieve lower detection thresholds and greater acces-sibility than established gold-standard procedures, including ELISA assays conducted on automated central laboratory platforms, they present interesting alternatives [106].",

This is categorized as radioimmunoassay [178], fluorescent dye immunoassay [179], chemiluminescence immunoassay [180], and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay predicated on protein labeling components (ELISA). NPs functionalized with antibodies, such as human IgG and antibodies against harmful bacteria, were used to develop various immunoassays [181]. Rather than classical monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, immunosensors were created utilizing signal peptide shard variable recombinant antibodies (scFv). High contrast, controllable dimensions, frame and surface characteristics, ease of integrating various functionalities, and lengthy circulation period are some of the advantages of NPs [182]. Numerous NP devices are currently being developed for variety of clinical signs, such as superparamagnetic agents, metal NPs, liposomes, and others. The bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, toxicological, immunogenicity, and selectivity of every device differ. The innovation of immune and aptamer-based nanowire biosensors to recognize cancer biomarkers such as VEGF [183], CA125 [184], or SARS virus N-protein [185] showed tremendous sensitivity, suggesting that these nanodevices could be used for point-of-care clinical purposes. To acknowledge diverse diseases such as cancer, a multimode strategy is essential to improve efficacy of biosensors treatment. Zheng et al. [186] characterized nanowire clusters for multiplexed identification of many proteomic biomarkers at the pg/mL level, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA-alpha1-antichymotrypsin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucin-1. Due to their controlled size and good biocompatibility with antibodies, proteins, RNA, and DNA, metallic NPs (Au NPs and Ag NPs) have been successfully used to label technology [187].",

            "text": "Because of the lack of strict regulation of their use as therapeutics, phage-based products are more widely considered for detection of pathogens in areas, such as food industry, water quality surveillance, or bioterrorism, where contaminations are frequently responsible of gastroenteritis, respiratory and mucosa infections, and if not worse, sequelae.\n\n6.1. Bacteria Biosensors. Gastrointestinal epidemics, as the outbreak occurred in Germany in 2011 caused by Shiga toxin-producing strain E. coli O104:H4, revealed a critical need of efficient tools for pathogen detection. Standard Oral decolonization Bacteraemia [84,97,106] microbiological methods for pathogen identification are time consuming; besides, molecular methods such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or DNA hybridization require high-purity specimens [128]. Likewise, enzymatic assays such as ELISA are very sensitive but not suitable for high-throughput screenings. For these reasons, phage-based technology represents an alternative approach to prevent such outbreaks, and phages have been recently considered for biosensoring bacteria [129,130]. To date, some systems have been developed with E. coli 0157:H7 as their target, and two main groups of applications are available: one uses inert phage particles or their proteins, the other requires infecting phages [131,132]. In addition, phages are able to replicate at high titres and with low costs, they are more resistant to temperature or pH variations compared to antibodies and can be kept at room temperature without activity loss [133]. FASTPlaqueTB assay takes advantage of these characteristics for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum: phages (Actiphages) that infect the slow-growing tubercle bacillus survive to the addiction of a virucide (Virusol) and are then detected through their plaques on nonpathogenic mycobacterial sensor cells [134].\n\n6.2.

Modified phages that bind strongly to the ligand displayed are enriched via sequential recovery from the surface and upon that they re-infect bacteria to propagate and increase in number. Filamentous phages M13 [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] and fd [34][35][36] are the most commonly used phages for phage display although T4, 37,38 T7 [39][40][41][42][43] and lambda [44][45][46][47] phages have also been used. Traditionally phage display has been used for antibody production, proteomics, 48 therapeutics, diagnostics (specially for cancer applications), infectious diseases and drug discovery. 49,50 Phage display has also been used for epitope mapping, a method to identify the epitope of the antigen that interacts with an antibody. The identification of epitopes is important for the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines and new therapeutic targets. 51,52 Additionally, phage display has proven useful in targeting membrane receptors via the identification of their agonists and antagonists, which present biological applications as drugs for various diseases. 53 5][56][57] Its biggest advantage, compared to other methods established in the protein-protein interactions field, is that highly diverse peptide libraries can be constructed at low cost. 56 These are some of the applications of phage display.

            "text": "Immunoassays are used to quantify biomolecules (analytes) using specific antibodies produced against these particular molecules [1]. Since 1978, when ELISA was first described [2], it became the gold standard antigenantibody detection assay in basic research of which some assays were further optimized for diagnostic purposes and became commercially available. More recent pointof-care diagnostic technologies such as smart cards [3] and lab-on-chip technology [4] were also based on the same principles of ELISA. Among the different types of ELISA, sandwich ELISA is considered a more sensitive and robust assay and tends to be the most commonly used type. Sandwich ELISA targets one antigen using two different antigenic sites detected by two different antibodies in the same assay. The first is known as \"the capturing antibody\" that is bound to the solid phase. This antibody captures the analyte from the sample then another antibody known as \"the detection antibody\" is used to detect the antigen bound-now sandwiched [1]. \n\nDiagnostic studies rely on sandwich ELISA as a key assay in many fields. It is used in the detection of bacterial [5], parasitic [6], fungal [7], and viral infections in both human and animals [8] as well as in botany research to detect plant viral disease [9]. In addition, it is also used in biomarker profiling [10,11] and biomarker-based diagnostic assays for cancer diagnosis [12], diagnosis of autoimmune diseases [13], and Alzheimer's [14]. Moreover, it has applications in vaccine development [15] and conjugate vaccine assessment [16]. Also, it is of use in discrimination of allergic cultivates for human [17] and even as a basic bio-approach in engineering as in early-diagnostic biosensors [18]. \n\nSandwich ELISA, despite being a conventional assay, was in many cases further developed into time saving diagnostic kits. One successful example is the immunochromatographic card (ICT) for qualitative detection of circulating filariasis, Wuchereria bancrofti, antigen [19].",

            "text": "Electrochemical biosensors, such as antibodies and antibody fragments, frequently incorporate these pathogen-detection biorecognition components. Immunosensors are biosensors that use biorecognition elements based on antibodies. Due to their high affinity and selectivity for target species, antibodies serve as the gold standard in pathogen detection as the gold standard biorecognition element. An epitope is an antigen region recognized by antibodies as a specific binding site [130]. Using fluorescent or enzymatic tags, antibodies can be labeled as label-based techniques. As a result of the additional reagents and processing steps needed for label-based approaches, there are measurement limitations [33,36]. The biosensor's selectivity may also be affected by antibody labeling, which alters the binding affinity to the antigen. Pathogen detection methods based on label-based biosensing have previously been discussed in depth elsewhere [155,156]. \n\nSelected pathogen detection is made possible by using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies [130]. The production process, selectivity, and binding affinity all vary. Hybridoma technology is used to create monoclonal antibodies [157]. Because of their high specificity and affinity for a particular epitope, monoclonal antibodies are more resistant to cross-reactivity. Monoclonal antibodies are better at identifying specific targets. Immunoglobulin proteins can be isolated from contaminated blood and used to produce polyclonal antibodies [157]. A single antigen can be specifically targeted by polyclonal antibodies, which are generated in large quantities and have particular epitopes. Because of the larger batch-to-batch variability of polyclonal antibodies than monoclonal antibodies, they are more expensive to produce but may be used in wider applications [158]. Lowtemperature storage is one of the drawbacks of antibody use, as is the high cost. Pathogen detection relies on biorecognition elements. A monoclonal antibody is the most common biosensing element utilized in testing, including secondary binding stages, whereas polyclonal antibodies are used secondarily to assist in target marking.",

Nevertheless, antibody-based test systems have a number of shortcomings that have stimulated a search for alternative diagnostic assays. Oligonucleotide aptamers are now considered as promising molecular recognizing elements for biosensors (aptasensors) due to their high affinity and specificity of target binding. At the moment, a huge variety of aptasensors have been engineered for the detection of various analytes, especially disease biomarkers. However, despite their great potential and excellent characteristics in model systems, only a few of these aptamer-based assays have been translated into practice as diagnostic kits. Here, we will review the current progress in the engineering of aptamer-based colorimetric assays as the most suitable format for clinical lab diagnostics. In particular, we will focus on aptasensors for the detection of blood biomarkers of cardiovascular, malignant, and neurodegenerative diseases along with common inflammation biomarkers. We will also analyze the main obstacles that have to be overcome before aptamer test systems can become tantamount to ELISA for clinical diagnosis purposes.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (Kaplon et al. 2020). For the discovery of these antibodies, in vitro display technologies have played an important role (Bradbury et al. 2011, Bazan et al. 2012, Frenzel et al. 2016, Laustsen et al. 2021). One of the major advantages of in vitro display technologies is their utility for rapidly screening and/ or selecting antibodies from very large libraries (Ledsgaard et al. 2018). This enables the identification of highly specific, high-affinity antibodies to a wide range of target antigens, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, and cells regardless of their immunogenicity and toxicity (Bradbury et al. 2011). One of the most commonly used in vitro display methods is antibody phage display technology, which involves biopanning of an antibody-displaying phage library against a target, upon which typically only a relatively small subset of the selected binders are picked for screening, (Sanger) sequencing, and functional assays (Ledsgaard et al. 2018, Alfaleh et al. 2020). While antibody phage display technology has been utilized to discover several successful therapeutic antibodies, such as one of the top-selling drugs, adalimumab (Ecker et al. 2015, Grilo andMantalaris 2019), recent studies suggest that to truly unlock the full potential of display technologies, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is key (Domina et al. 2014, Liu et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2017, Ljungars et al. 2019, Mattsson et al. 2023). The reason for this is that HTS allows for the screening and analysis of the entire pool of antibodies during the biopanning process, rather than the assessment and characterization of only a small subset of the most abundant clones. This may allow for the identification of rare clones in the antibody pools that might otherwise have been missed (Ljungars et al. 2019).",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a type of flavivirus transmitted globally by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and is the causal agent of Dengue fever. Due to global warm-ing and rising temperatures worldwide, the rate of exposure to DENV is now reaching unprecedented levels, with over 400 million people getting infected each year. Despite worldwide attention to DENV, there is not currently an effective treatment or vaccine. Here, we focused on developing an antibody for the NS1 protein of the DENV, which enables earlier detection of disease and could further decrease the rate of death. Our study utilized a method more time-saving and cost-effective than the traditional method of extracting antibodies from the blood or B-cells of infected animals that show immu-nity: Phage Display. This technique allowed us to derive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the genome library and select DENV antibodies that bind to antigen proteins. In this study, we used Phage Display to select ninety-six potential antibodies from three phases of panning, which then went through indirect ELISA screening for optical density (OD) confirmation (OD > 1.5). Sixteen of the high optical density antibodies were sent to a DNA sequencing analysis facility where fifteen of them were revealed to be the same 1G1 strain. By understanding how antibodies are discovered using phage display technology, we hope to advance the field with reevaluation of current vaccines and the development of novel ones.",

            "text": "Epitopes are crucial components in the development of effective vaccines against infectious pathogens. These regions on the antigen's surface engage with antibodies, B-cell and T-cell receptors, and serve as the portions of a pathogen that the immune system identifies and attacks. By identifying and selecting the most potent epitopes, it becomes feasible to design vaccines that trigger a strong immune response against the pathogen, while minimizing harm to the host [1,2]. \n\nPhage display technology shows great promise as an approach for identifying and selecting epitopes. This technique enables the screening of extensive libraries of peptides or proteins against a specific target, such as a pathogen, facilitating the identification of highly specific epitopes. The successful utilization of phage display has been observed in the identification and selection of epitopes across a wide range of pathogens, encompassing viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Once these epitopes have been identified, they can be harnessed for the development of vaccines that precisely target the pathogen in question [3]. Notably, phage display has proven effective in identifying epitopes from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4], which have been used for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostic tests [5]. Furthermore, phage display has been utilized to identify epitopes derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \n\nThese epitopes not only hold value in the realm of Tuberculosis (TB) serodiagnosis but also play a crucial role in the development of a potential TB vaccine [6]. \n\nThe objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of epitope identification, covering various aspects such as the different techniques employed, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and the utilization of phages in the process. Additionally, it will delve into the procedure of epitope or mimotope selection using phage display, examining both the general applications for selecting pathogenic epitopes and specific applications within the realm of infectious diseases. Lastly, the study will explore the role of phages in the development of vaccines.",

            "text": "Microbial infections have dramatically spread over the past few decades to be considered one of the most urgent global challenges. Delaying diagnosis might lead to death [69,70]. Thus, early detection (as much as possible) for virulence factors, pathogens, and biological toxins is very necessary to prevent the progression of infection and to provide effective treatments. Electrochemical immune-sensors are among the most common biosensing platforms for microbial detection and identification [71]. The signal is usually obtained through the immobilization of a bio-recognition element on the working electrode surface. The assay steps often end with the injection of a secondary enzyme-labeled antibody that follows the addition of a proper enzymatic substrate [72]. In addition to immunosensors, several methods were used to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the electrochemical biosensors. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)-based electrochemical biosensors are one of those methods. MIPs were created via chemical, photochemical, or electrochemical methods in the presence of a target template molecule(s). MIPs' exploitation using completely microbial cells as a template have been reported for many applications, including microbial fuel, specific cell capture, cell sorting, separation, and microbial detection. MIP biosensors were also fabricated for the rapid capture and identification of Salmonella typhimurium in minced beef samples [73]. Using cyclic voltammetry, the assay optimization and validation have been achieved, reaching a high selectivity and sensitivity against the imprinted cells of S. typhimurium. Bacteriophages can serve as high-efficiency bio-receptors for the development of electrochemical biosensing platforms. Bacteriophage-sensing platforms have high specificity against their bacterial host [74,75]. In addition, in terms of thermal stability and sensitivity to the changes in surrounding pHs, or solvents, a bacteriophage-based biosensor is more preferable than the immunosensors [74]. In this regard, Mona Tolba and her team developed an impedimetric phage-based biosensors for the selective determination of Listeria innocua serovar [76].",

            "text": "The global challenge now and in the future will be the rapid development of diagnostic tests for the detection of infectious disease. Better in-field diagnostics are required to monitor disease emergence and to track the progress of disease throughout populations. Furthermore, more than 50% of emerging diseases in humans over the past several decades are a result of transmittal between animals and humans; 119 Zoonotic disease emergence include more recent global health concerns regarding the spread of Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although there are concerted efforts by organizations such as The World Health Organization (WHO) to deploy diagnostics to monitor emerging infectious diseases in humans, and other organizations to monitor disease emergence in animals, there is little done to connect the two monitoring systems together to use animal sickness to predict human dieases. 120 As such, in addition to monitoring human population health, early and rapid field tests are required to enable health care task force officials and scientists to monitor potential animal-to-human pathogens. Current approaches to vaccine, drug, and diagnostic development toward infectious diseases have been shown to be inadequate. 121\u2212123 As of yet, no vaccine has ever been developed in time to change the course of an outbreak. 123 Government agencies are calling for flexible development and production platform technologies to improve R&D readiness for priority infectious disease threats. 121 As such, there is an absolute necessity for novel platform technologies whereby new antibodies can be rapidly isolated and incorporated into novel assay formats that are temperature, solution, and (biosensor) surface stable. Such reagents need to be seamlessly incorporated into cost-effective diagnostic devices that can be distributed and easily utilized in urban and rural environments.\n\nIn this review we have described state-of-the-art technologies which achieve these goals by creating nanostructures that comprise of antibody components and cell wall fragments. The nanoscaled cell wall fragment of these antibody composite structures renders exceptional temperature storage, and biosensor application stability.

            "text": "A large number of recombinant antibodies for application in diagnostics and therapy were already generated by phage display against viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. Antibody phage display allows the generation of antibodies originating from several species, including human, camel, llama, alpaca, chimpanzee, macaque, pig, mice, chicken or shark. These antibodies are derived from two types of library  sources: immune or universal libraries. Immune libraries are preferred when convalescent patients or immunized animals/ human donors are available. This approach offers the advantage to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. Universal antibody gene libraries offer an alternative if immunization is not possible, ethically not feasible or patient samples are not available. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic should teach us to be prepared for the next pandemic, which beyond any doubt will come. We need permanent preparedness platforms which will react on novel pathogens arising worldwide and provide antibodies for diagnostics and as potential therapeutic lead candidates. This preparedness platforms should also have a budget for immediate start of GMP production and clinical phase I/II studies. In the most cases, new pathogens may have only a local impact, but this cannot be assured. Also these antibodies are always valuable tools for research and diagnostics of the pathogens. \n\nWe do not build a fire department when the house is already burning, we need to establish it in advance and maintain this service also in times without emergency. We have to think in the same way about infectious diseases and potential pandemics.",

            "text": "Phage display technology (Figure 3) emerges as the primary method for preparing mimicking peptides, vital in toxin detection. These polypeptides mimic antigen epitopes and entail genetic modification of phage DNA. By binding to a phage coat protein, peptides, proteins, and antibody fragments are expressed on the phage surface. Additionally, the introduction of exogenous DNA sequences permits the display of related genes and their products on the phage surface (58,59). Moreover, the protein or peptide maintains its ability to recognize molecular targeted binding sites (60). In 1985, Smith pioneered the phage display technique, fusing the restriction endonuclease EcoR I with the PIII protein as a recombinant small coat protein (61). Subsequently, the shell proteins PVIII and PVI were also employed for phage display (62-64), with the innovative proposal of a dual display system (65). The M13 phages utilized in phage display can be classified into different carriers, including 3 + 3, 6 + 6, and 8 + 8 types. Phage vectors are primarily categorized into type 3/8 and type 33/88 vectors based on the number of displayed exogenous peptides (66). Phage display technology, renowned for its remarkable specificity and sensitivity, finds extensive application in nano immunosensor development for toxin detection. This versatile tool excels in epitope mapping and identifying mimotopes for diverse antigens. In essence, phage display technology stands as a potent approach for crafting highly specific and sensitive nano immunosensors, revolutionizing cholera toxin detection in water sources. \n\nPhage display technology has revolutionized protein engineering and drug discovery. Among the most common type are random peptide libraries, showcasing millions of epitopes that aid in identifying specific binding peptides for various targets, including microorganisms, organ tissues, and nanoparticles (67). Biopanning enables the selection of peptides with high affinity and selectivity towards their targets (68). The advancement of cyclic peptides has further bolstered the technology, yielding peptides with enhanced stability and bioactivity.",

            "text": "Amino acid MREs for detection of disease are a potential clinical application of these molecules. For biomarker-based cancer detection, blood is typically extracted and subjected to immunoassays with monoclonal antibodies. There also lies the potential for magnetic, radio-, or fluorescent labeling of these antibodies for diagnostics. Antibodies used in these assays do not always bind to molecules that represent disease states. For example, screens for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are not predictive of the presence of prostate cancer over 75% of the time [108]. This is not due to antibody specificity, but due to the poor specificity of PSA as a biomarker. Thus, these diagnostic applications make it necessary to identify MREs that bind directly to malignant cells and not to poor biomarkers that may not accurately detect the presence of disease. \n\nInitial research using peptide MREs obtained by SELEX has been promising. Ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies using colon cancer-specific peptides have been performed [109]. Using radiolabeled and fluorescent peptides, favorable pharmacological profiles and detection were observed. Similar results were found using an anti-prostate cancer peptide selected by phage display [110]. While not extensively explored for clinical use, peptide MREs may have great diagnostic potential. \n\nSimilar studies to those performed with peptide MREs have been done with antibody fragments [111][112][113]. Another potential use of antibody MREs is in ex vivo diagnostics such as immunoassays or microfluidic cell capture. Though using a monoclonal antibody, previous studies have shown the ability to capture circulating tumor cells with antibodies in a microfluidic device [111]. There is the obvious potential for application of antibody fragment MREs to a similar device. These and other uses make the diagnostic potential of amino acid MREs extremely important.",

            "text": ", specific fluorescence labeled DNA probes [12], PCR [13] or recently, a quantum dot-based bead assay [14]. Currently, high throughput diagnostic of S. Typhimurium is performed by indirect ELISA [9,15,16]. The commercially available ELISA kits e. g. SALMOTYPE W -or Enterisol W -ELISA use a mixture of O-antigens of Salmonella enterica subspecies entirca serovars. They are based on the system established by Nielson et al. [15]. Because of this mixture, crossreactions occur with other bacteria [15]. In addition, the sensitivity varies between the different ELISA assays [17]. For a sensitive and specific ELISA, immunogenic and species specific proteins are required [18]. The improvement of detection methods, as well as the development of new vaccines would be facilitated by the identification, characterisation and validation of previously unknown immunogenic proteins.\n\nThe most common method for the identification of immunogenic proteins is 2D-PAGE of cultured bacterial pathogens and immunoblot using sera from infected patients or animals followed by mass spectrometry or microsequencing [19][20][21][22][23][24]. However, this method is limited. Differentially expressed proteins, e.g. dependent on pathogen-host interaction, can not be detected. Furthermore, weakly expressed antigens may also not be identified. In these cases, antigen phage display may circumvent these limitations. Our approach for the identification of immunogenic proteins is phage display. Phage display technology was invented by George P. Smith [25]. This methods can be used both for the selection of antibodies [26][27][28][29] and for the identification of immunogenic proteins from genomic or cDNA libraries [30][31][32][33][34]. Here, the cloning of randomly fragmented genomic DNA or cDNA into phage display vectors should allow, in theory, the display of all polypeptides encoded by the genome of the donor or all polypeptides encoded by the transcriptome of the donor, respectively [35,36].

            "text": "Very often, they have been grouped into the following categories: biosensors based on direct detection of bacteria, flow-injection biosensors, monitoring bacterial metabolism, detection of enzyme labels, genosensors and the emerging artifical nose [31]. The mot popular bio-probes employed for these surface biosensors for pathogens detection are nucleic acid, antibody, entire phages, phage display peptide (PDP) and more recently the phage's receptor binding proteins. Biosensors does not suffer for a long time of sample pre-enrichment, nor a step of secondary enrichment, therefore, they can predict the level and type of contamination of food. All this, faster than biological, microbiological, immunological and conventional molecular methods [40]. \n\nFor long time nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassays (NALFIA) has been used as biosensors for the detection of nucleic acid. In these assays, nucleic acids can be captured on the lateral flow test strips by means of relation of independent or dependent antibodies. Amongst the advantages of lateral flow strips can be mentioned: one-step, simplicity, fast results, low cost, versatile and a prolonged shelf life. Moreover if compared with traditional electrophoresis detection, NALFIA has other advantages like shorter response time, and no needs hazardous reagents. NALFIA can be used as biosensor for bacterial detection due to its characteristics: test finished after 5 -10 min, species selectivity, direct measurement, portable and designed for field application. This is complemented with a simple manufacturing process. Finally, if NALFIA strips are used with coloured nanoparticles, an easy visual detection can be afforded. This combination overcomes the need of have expensive equipments which is a major shortcomings in the application of immunosensor techniques, a fact acknowledged by Noguera et al, whom have reported the use of a carbon nanoparticles-NALFIAs combination for rapid detection and identification of genes encoding various STEC virulence factors (vt1, vt2) [38].",

            "text": "As a dangerous and versatile pathogen, S. aureus possesses a variety of virulence factors that allow it to cause a multitude of severe diseases. One subset of virulence factors is staphylococcal enterotoxins, which are potent bacterial super antigens with toxic effects that directly interfere with host cells. 8 Enterotoxins are commonly known for their pyrogenic effects and interference with intestinal function; hence, they are mainly associated with staphylococcal food poisoning in humans. 70 While there are many types of staphylococcal enterotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induces one of the most profound toxic effects because of its ability to mount a massive host immune response, leading to a cytokine storm and subsequent acute toxic shock. 71 Effective and reliable detection methods must be carried out in identifying SEB during clinical diagnosis and food analysis. \n\nImmunological techniques, such as enzyme-linked absorbent assay (ELISA), are the most commonly used approaches; however, they are both time-consuming and inconvenient. 72 In addition, these assays use monoclonal antibody for detection in which they are of high cost and have continually become a major burden in the healthcare system. 48 lternative means to developing antibodies have recently been discovered with the use of antibodies from camelids. These types of antibodies are capable of antigen binding despite not having any light chains. 73 onsequently, they are mostly known as a nanobody or camelid heavy chain antibody (VHH). VHH may render the use of traditional monoclonal antibodies obsolete as VHH has become more profound in numerous medical applications. To investigate its purpose with SEB, an SEB-specific and sensitive camelid nanobody was produced using phage display. 48 Two phage clones were found to have the highest affinity to SEB with one of them demonstrating a high specificity of 10 \u22129 M. Phage display technology on its own provides an ideal pathway for detecting SEB with the screening of peptides that may prove to be highly SEB-specific.",

These new techniques in human phage display platforms have been an enabling technology for the very rapid identification and isolation of specific mAbs, and have eliminated the time-consuming processes of immunization, hybridoma development and humanization techniques. Neutralizing human mAbs reactive to the G glycoprotein of HeV and NiV have been successfully identified, isolated, and characterized using these recombinant antibody techniques [69]. In particular, Fab' fragment m102 had significant neutralizing activities against both henipaviruses and mapped to the receptor binding domain of HeV and NiV G [69,70]. Subsequently, m102 was converted to a full length human IgG1 antibody, affinity maturated (m102.4) and evaluated in virus neutralization assays. The m102.4 human IgG antibody could completely neutralize both HeV and NiV at concentrations as low as 10 \u03bcg/ml (Zhu, Z. and Bossart, K.; unpublished data). In light of its potency in vitro, its mechanism of neutralization and the fact that is a fully human antibody, m102.4 could provide a valuable post-exposure or post-infection therapeutic for disease caused by HeV or NiV in humans. Pharmacological assays are currently under development and will be discussed below.",

            "text": "Microbial and viral identification and quantification assays usually rely on conventional approaches of plating and culture methods, as well as on biochemical testing, microscopy, etc. Over the last 20 years, many new methods have been developed, including immunological methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and biosensors [88]. Plating and culture methods often fail to provide the required specificity and sensitivity and in addition it takes a long time (up to 7 days). PCR, although very specific and suitable for screening purposes, still fails to produce accurate results when enumeration of viable cells is needed [89]. Immunological detection with antibodies is perhaps the most successful technology employed for the detection of cells, spores, viruses and toxins alike [90]. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised quickly and cheaply but they are often unspecific and available in limited amounts. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have the advantage of ensuring reproducibility and permanent reagent supply [89]. The availability of MAbs, together with the emergence of recombinant antibody phage display technology, has made immunological detection of microbial contamination more sensitive, specific, reproducible and reliable [1]. These technologies, when incorporated in biosensors, significantly shorten the assay time and improve the analytical performance of pathogen detection. Biosensors can also be based on specific or non-specific protein interactions (with antibodies, antigens or enzymes), DNA hybridization or other biomaterials. \n\nThe immobilization of biomolecules on the solid substrate of the transducer surface is essential to ensure biosensor performance, because of its role in specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and recycling ability. Among all of the immobilizing methods reported in the literature, covalent binding is the most promising technique since it allows retention of biological activity of biomolecules after immobilization. Covalent immobilization assures a reproducible, durable and stable attachment to the substrate against physico-chemical variations in the aqueous microenvironment.",

The foreign amino acids that form the biospecific 'active site' of a landscape phage comprise up to 25% of the total weight of the particle and up to 50% of its surface area, which can accommodate hundreds of bound protein antigens. More detailed information regarding the evolution of the landscape phage detector paradigm, starting from its appearance in 1996 as a distinct part of the phage display concept [42], which use the landscape phage as phage substitute antibodies in the first phage biosensor, and the development of the landscape-phage-based biosensors for the liquid biopsy of PC, can be found in the references [33,35,36,48,49,[52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65]. \n\nThe PC detection techniques can be divided into two major categories: (1) cancer cell imaging, and (2) cancer-cell-secreted soluble biomarker detection techniques [15]. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by their high cost and intrinsic sensitivity to the components of body fluids [7,15,16,21,22,[66][67][68][69][70][71][72]. Harnessing the power of molecular evolution, the phage display technique offers a new way of generating a rich repertoire of binding probes for any protein ligand or receptor. The idea of phage display as a molecular evolution tool lies in the genetic fusion of a foreign protein to the phage capsid and its preservation through the viral replication [29][30][31]42,73].",

            "text": "Indeed, additional incentives for research and clinical studies are needed to validate new diagnostic tests and their effectiveness. Researchers are currently involved in developing alternative diagnostic methods for different diseases with the aim of improving such tests. A notable example is lateral flow biosensors, which show considerable promise due to their sensitivity, specificity, accessibility, speed, robustness, and independence of equipment. These devices offer an innovative approach to disease detection and monitoring, offering significant advantages over traditional diagnostic methods [91,92]. Furthermore, this platform assay are designed to provide swift results and can be directly performed in the field without the need to send samples to central laboratories, thus allowing a faster diagnosis [93]. Moreover, researchers have also been continuously improving the ELISA platform as a diagnostic tool [94]. \n\nAnother point to be considered is the choice of antigen, which is fundamental to developing a successful diagnostic test. Several methods are currently available, assisting in better targeting for antigen selection, such as bioinformatics analyses and phage display. Bioinformatics analyses identify pathogens at a lower cost and in less time since the antigens of pathogens can be identified, without the need to manipulate the microorganism [95,96]. Furthermore, phage display have been widely used in the discovery and development of new characterizations of protein-protein interactions and in epitope mapping. Their versatility and efficiency make it a powerful tool for the study and practical application of protein interactions, increasing yields and reducing costs [97][98][99]. \n\nIt is crucial to improve the effectiveness of TL diagnostic tests, allowing early detection, monitoring its spread, and contributing to the development of more effective preventive and therapeutic measures [100]. According to the World Health Organization [4], there are several initiatives underway to improve the diagnosis of neglected diseases. WHO and its partners are working to strengthen health systems in affected countries by improving access to accurate and timely diagnoses.",

            "text": "Since a large number of infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic bacterial strains, it is obvious that such strains should be specifically detected during diagnostic procedures. Different approaches are used to obtain satisfactory results. The platform used for detection often depends on the kind of molecular target in the pathogen that has been chosen. When nucleic acids are used, a precise detection of bacteria is possible, but the main disadvantage of this method is the requirement for the isolation and purification of target molecules prior to their detection. This may be a time-consuming step, which makes the whole assay relatively long and expensive [1]. \n\nAnother approach is to recognize antigens on the surface of detected bacteria by using specific antibodies. This approach does not need any time-consuming initial preparation of the sample; however, antibodies are quite costly and cumbersome in preparation. Their performance, especially affinity and avidity, strongly affects the assay sensitivity. Moreover, an additional drawback is their limited shelf life, which limits the viability of ready-to-use antibody-based sensors [2]. \n\nRecently, it was demonstrated that antibodies can be replaced with bacteriophages in assays devoted to detecting bacteria [3,4]. These viruses offer many advantages over standard antibodies in detection procedures, namely, phage proteins engaged in host recognition are extremely stable, phages are easy to isolate and propagate, and they can be stored for a relatively long time. These features make bacteriophages a cheap and fully functional tool that can replace primary antibodies in procedures of immunological detection of bacteria [5,6]. \n\nBacteriophages have already been widely used for the identification of bacteria in phage typing tests [7][8][9][10]. In these assays, one can employ the relatively narrow host range of some phages, which is limited to one or several strains. When multiple phages with partially overlapping host ranges are used, the ability of the tested bacterial strain to support the growth of some of phages from the collection can be considered as a kind of a fingerprint, allowing for easy and inexpensive strain identification. However, classical phage typing is useful to distinguish bacterial strains, but not to detect them in a clinical or environmental sample.",

The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [116][117][118] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [119].\n\nAntibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery \"missiles\" for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [120]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [121]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [99,122]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37\u00b0C [123]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [99,124].\n\nThe identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [125][126][127]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [128]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogeninfected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [129]",

The advantages of these approaches include: rapid, high throughput screening of known targets and quantitative endpoints. Multiplex protein solution array is one application that represents a generation of antibody-based detection technology that allows the simultaneous quantification of multiple analytes in a single, small volume sample. Multiplex protein solution array has a number of advantages over current analyte quantification technologies, including: measurement of many biomarkers (up to 100 different analytes) in a single sample; wider operational dynamic range; and increased sensitivity and specificity derived from multivariate modelling of combinations of biomarker analytes. This system utilises a sandwich ELISA-like protocol, in which capture antibodies are coupled to spectrally distinct polystyrene or metal beads (5-6 \u00b5m diameter).

            "text": "For instance, various types of heterophilic antibodies have been demonstrated in numerous studies to bind to animal immunoglobulins used in immunoassays, thus interfering with serum immunoassays (23,24). Furthermore, most natural antibodies can react with one or more autoantigens (25), and by interacting with various selfcomponents present in the organism, natural antibodies establish an extensive dynamic network that contributes to the general homeostasis of the organism (26). Therefore, positive clones identified by SEREX screening may include those that react with natural antibodies. To reduce false positive clones being screened, a second-round screening was conducted for all positive clones, and of the 54 clones initially identified as positive for reactions with cancer sera, 18 showed higher reactions with healthy sera. These clones were excluded due to the possibility that they might react with some common natural antibodies. The second-round screening allows these pre-screened tumorassociated autoantibodies with higher diagnostic specificity. \n\nThe sequences in phage display system may be relatively short peptides rather than full-length proteins, as seen in other literature (27). In addition, since the phage display system is based on a prokaryotic expression platform, the expressed tumor antigens are deficient in modification processes (such as glycosylation) commonly found in higher organisms. The absence of glycosylation may even alter the immunogenicity of the antigens (28)(29)(30), and therefore, the antibodies screened may have low specificity or low affinity. Some studies showed that, with eukaryotic display systems such as yeast or mammalian cells (31, 32), it is possible to screen for high-affinity antibodies with well-defined biological specificities. And this is also one of our improvement goals afterward. \n\nTAAs have been studied in the past for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, but ELISA assays were applied in these studies; this method made it difficult to increase the number of indicators and had low throughput, narrow linearity range, and poor precision. Therefore, the screening and matching of markers from a larger panel to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis is one of the directions in the field of early diagnosis of lung cancer.",

            "text": "The overwhelming majority of them are aptasensors with optical (colorimetric, fluorescent, or luminescent) [10,11] and electrochemical types of detection [12,13]. It should be noted that aptasensors utilizing fluorescent and electrochemical detection usually possess a high sensitivity and selectivity, but often need additional sample pre-processing, specialized equipment, and highly qualified personnel. \n\nNevertheless, very few of these aptamer-based test systems have found practical applications in real clinical laboratories. In our opinion, this may be because the wide potential diversity of aptamer-compatible biosensor platforms led to the dissipation of research efforts. In contrast, the characteristics of antibodies impose a greater number of restrictions. This factor limits a choice of variants for diagnostic test systems and allows for more in-depth concentration on each of them, which ultimately leads to practical use. Moreover, aptamer-based tests often represent quite sophisticated systems of an unconventional format, with equipment and protocols that are unusual for a clinical laboratory. Therefore, they are poorly perceived by the medical community, who are the end users of any diagnostic assay. \n\nIn the context of clinical diagnostics, colorimetric aptasensors have attracted particular attention. They require only a standard spectrophotometer or colorimeter, which is routine for any clinical lab, and imply typical ELISA protocols. At the moment, there are several aptamer-based commercially available diagnostic kits for the colorimetric detection of individual biomarkers in biological samples [14,15]. In our opinion, colorimetric aptasensors seem to be the most prospective candidates for routine laboratory diagnostics. \n\nIn this review, we will focus on a critical analysis of the currently developed aptamerbased colorimetric test systems, including their characteristics, limitations, and future prospects. Since blood biomarkers are of the utmost importance in clinical diagnostics and the monitoring of different diseases, we narrowed down the topic of this review to colorimetric aptasensors for the detection of blood biomarkers.",

            "text": "The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay. \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined in the biopanning process, it is essential to highlight the importance of performing a subtractive selection using antibodies from negative samples. This critical step aims to eliminate non-specific binders in the library and clones that may bind to the constant part of the antibodies. To mitigate any potential interference during the panning process, it is recommended to add these antibodies to the phage library. One approach to achieving this is by incubating the serum sample on a surface coated with helper phages (e.g., for phagemid M13) or the original phage without an insert (e.g., for T7 phage) This effectively removes phage-specific antibodies before further utilization. \n\nAfter obtaining the selected hits, it is important to optimize them if needed, possibly through techniques like site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a thorough characterization of the hits is necessary to assess their antibody binding capability, their potential to elicit an immune response, and the effectiveness of that immune response. \n\nThe epitopes of a pathogen identified through phage display have diverse applications, including the development of diagnostic tests, understanding pathogen-host interactions, and the creation of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines. \n\nMoreover, numerous studies have employed phage display techniques in the context of infectious diseases, using two key components: a phage display library and antibodies from samples taken from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. For instance, in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), mimotopes were identified using antibodies from hepatitis A patients. One of the identified phages exhibited the ability to hinder the attachment of anti-HAV antibodies, eliciting a specific immune response in mice. Similarly, phage display libraries were utilized to discover mimotopes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), leading to the generation of highly specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mimotopes of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein were identified using serum from an HCV-infected patient.",

Typhimurium is necessary to prevent foodborne diseases. Currently, commercially available ELISA assays are based on a mixture of O-antigens (LPS) or total cell lysate of Salmonella and are hampered by cross-reaction. The identification of novel immunogenic proteins would be useful to develop ELISA based diagnostic assays with a higher specificity.ResultsA phage display library of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium genome was constructed and 47 immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using a pool of convalescent sera from pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. The corresponding complete genes of seven of the identified oligopeptids were cloned. Five of them were produced in E. coli. The immunogenic character of these antigens was validated with sera from pigs infeced with S. Tyhimurium and control sera from non-infected animals. Finally, human antibody fragments (scFv) against these five antigens were selected using antibody phage display and characterised.ConclusionIn this work, we identified novel immunogenic proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium and generated antibody fragments against these antigens completely based on phage display. Five immunogenic proteins were validated using a panel of positive and negative sera for prospective applications in diagnostics of Salmonela Typhimurium.",

Because of the lack of antibodies and the need for extremely sensitive findings, or because the pathogen is present but does not create a significant number of antibodies, DNA-based tests are widely utilized in diagnostics [8,10]. Detecting pathogens that have recently been present in a sample is essential for DNA-based testing to work. Toxins, antibodies, and genes that create toxins can be used to identify pathogens. Toxins, nucleic acids, and viruses are examples of pathogen detection targets. There are many biorecognition components to choose from, from antibodies to aptamers to imprinted polymers [12][13][14]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [15] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [16,17] have been extensively studied for the detection of infections. \n\nBecause of its high sensitivity and specificity, applicability in monitoring, early detection of biothreat agents, and antimicrobial resistance profiling, PCR technology (conventional and real-time PCR) is most frequently utilized in pathogen detection [18,19]. However, it has shortcomings, including the inability to distinguish between infections with identical genetic composition. For instance, when PCR has been used to identify Listeria monocytogenes [20] and Bacillus cereus [21], respectively, false signals of Listeria Immunoassays and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based assays are often used to identify and quantify infections [8,9]. For example, toxin-and species-specific gene sequence data can influence the use of immunoassay or a DNA test at different stages of infection. Immunoassays are regularly used in medical diagnosis and food safety [10]. Immunoglobulins (Igs) are created during and after infection, making them useful for pathogen identification (when the pathogen is gone). These tests involve both the biorecognition component and the target antibody. Immunoassays can be used to detect infections in the body if antigens are made available.",

The fundamental methods developed for nucleic acid diagnostics are enzymatic DNA restriction, nucleic acid hybridization, PCR, and fluorescence-based techniques [173]. Of these techniques, DNA amplification procedures utilizing PCR and PCR-based methods (real-time PCR, strand displacement amplification, nested PCR, etc) are of particular interest given that DNA is present at a low concentration within a typical biological sample.

            "text": "Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection that poses a substantial healthcare burden, yet its definitive diagnosis can be challenging. There is a need for a rapid, sensitive and reliable analytical method that could allow early detection of UTI and reduce unnecessary antibiotics. Pathogen identification along with quantitative detection of lactoferrin, a measure of pyuria, may provide useful information towards the overall diagnosis of UTI. Here, we report an integrated biosensor platform capable of simultaneous pathogen identification and detection of urinary biomarker that could aid the effectiveness of the treatment and clinical management. Methodology/Principal Findings The integrated pathogen 16S rRNA and host lactoferrin detection using the biosensor array was performed on 113 clinical urine samples collected from patients at risk for complicated UTI. For pathogen detection, the biosensor used sandwich hybridization of capture and detector oligonucleotides to the target analyte, bacterial 16S rRNA. For detection of the protein biomarker, the biosensor used an analogous electrochemical sandwich assay based on capture and detector antibodies. For this assay, a set of oligonucleotide probes optimized for hybridization at 37\u00b0C to facilitate integration with the immunoassay was developed. This probe set targeted common uropathogens including E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. as well as less common uropathogens including Serratia, Providencia, Morganella and Staphylococcus spp. The biosensor assay for pathogen detection had a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 89%. A significant correlation was found between LTF concentration measured by the biosensor and WBC and leukocyte esterase (p<0.001 for both). Conclusion/Significance We successfully demonstrate simultaneous detection of nucleic acid and host immune marker on a single biosensor array in clinical samples. This platform can be used for multiplexed detection of nucleic acid and protein as the next generation of urinary tract infection diagnostics.",

            "text": "Toxins are the most frequent antigenic target of therapeutic antibodies used to fight bacterial pathogens. This topic is thoroughly discussed in a dedicated paragraph: \"targeting of toxins with recombinant antibodies\". Excluding toxin antigens, antibodies raised against bacteria are predominantly used in diagnostics (Skottrup et al., 2011;Ferrara et al., 2012) and to assess the presence of contamination in environmental samples (Griep et al., 1998;Mechaly et al., 2008). As of today, microbiologic bacteria identification by cultivation remains the benchmark approach for the diagnostic of several pathogenic bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Norbis et al., 2014), Salmonella Typhimurium (Kuhn et al., 2012), or Listeria monocytogenes (Gasanov et al., 2005). \n\nThe many drawbacks of these methods are the low throughput and high costs caused by their inherently long experimental duration, the higher risk of exposure to pathogenic organisms and the need of highly trained personnel. Real-time PCR and other molecular diagnostics approaches have been introduced to reduce the time needed for the identification of many bacteria (Liang et al., 2018), while offering high detection sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, such methods most often depend on the availability of laboratory infrastructure and, if portable, are less amenable to high throughput parallelized measurements (Xu et al., 2020). Similarly, mass spectrometry is able to provide high sensitivity, however, this technology requires expensive devices and trained personnel (Dixon et al., 2015). On the other hand, antibody-based detection methods such as ELISA and immunochromatography, are faster, simpler, and well-suited for high-throughput. These features, together with the lower costs compared to other techniques, contributed to the success of these diagnostic approaches world-wide, including developing countries, where resources may be scarce and laboratories sparsely distributed over the territory. \n\nUp to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1).",

Overall, targeting highly specific peptides, rather than an entire protein with multiple epitope regions, could result in antibodies which are less likely to cross-react with other viruses or isolates of the viral species.\n\nThe initial development of pathogen-targeting antibodies requires time to identify a valid disease-specific antigen, isolate suitable antibodies and validate the resulting antibodies and assays. However, once generated, the production of the antibody proteins is relatively fast. Furthermore, the advent of recombinant antibody technology, whereby antibodies are produced as fragments of the whole antibody protein, has made the generation of antibodies more rapid and costeffective, as cheaper expression hosts such as yeasts and bacteria can be used in lieu of mammalian cell-culture (Jeong et al., 2011;Kunert and Reinhart, 2016).\n\nVirus-targeting antibodies are used in virology for multiple purposes. Two major applications are for the detection of virusassociated antigens from samples, and for determining seroprevalence. Seroprevalence assays are essential techniques for identifying patients who have been exposed to a virus . However, these assays rely on the identification of antivirus antibodies generated by the host, whereas this review focuses on the creation, employment and design of specific antibodies to detection pathogen-associated targets. As such, the following section largely deals with the use of antibodies for identifying virus-associated antigens from samples, with only brief mention to applications for seroprevalence monitoring. The detection of virus-antigens was initially facilitated by virus propagation through cell culture methods, whereby antibodies are used to detect virus-associated proteins within a cell line, or to perform virus neutralisation assays (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). However, as discussed, such cell culture methods are relatively slow when compared to other diagnostic means. Therefore, much focus is on the development of antibodybased assays capable of detecting the target-virus directly from source through a range of antibody-based assays, termed immunoassays.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have long been used for biological and medical research, as well as in vitro diagnostics. However, the derivation of mAbs is relatively expensive and time consuming. Over the past decade, an alternative and effective way to obtain monoclonal antibodies has been the use of recombinant antibody display libraries from which antibodies of interest can be selected and expressed in E. coli [1]. Filamentous phage display [2] is the most widely distributed display platform, with yeast [3] and ribosome display [4] also frequently used. The commonest antibody formats used are single chain Fvs (scFvs) [5] and Fabs. scFvs are recombinant constructs in which the variable domains of the heavy and light chains are covalently linked together by a flexible linker [5], whereas Fabs were originally described by the digestion of antibody with papain [6], and consist of two protein fragments, VH-CH1, and VL-CL that can be expressed separately in the E. coli periplasm where they assemble together [7]. Fulllength antibodies include the Fc region, which, from a reagent point of view, can be considered to be a large tag recognized by secondary antibodies or bacterial superantigens, such as protein A or G. Antibody fragments, in contrast, are usually modified by the fusion of in-frame tags to the antibody fragment. The commonest format includes a short peptide tag (e.g. myc [8] or SV5 [9]) recognized by a monoclonal antibody, and a histidine tag that can be used for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography [10]. Detection of antibody fragments using peptide tags generally requires an extra step when compared to the detection of full-length antibodies, since anti-peptide and subsequent labeled secondary antibodies are usually required. Given the recombinant nature of antibody fragments selected from phage display libraries, it was initially thought it would be relatively trivial to fuse effector domains directly to antibody fragments.",

            "text": "Immunoassays based on sandwich immuno-complexes of capture and detection antibodies simultaneously binding to the target analytes have been powerful technologies in molecular analyses. Recent developments in single molecule detection technologies enable the detection limit of the sandwich immunoassays approaching femtomolar (10\u201315 M), driving the needs of developing sensitive and specific antibodies for ever-increasingly broad applications in detecting and quantifying biomarkers. The key components underlying the sandwich immunoassays are antibody-based affinity reagents, for which the conventional sources are mono- or poly-clonal antibodies from immunized animals. The downsides of the animal-based antibodies as affinity reagents arise from the requirement of months of development timespan and limited choices of antibody candidates due to immunodominance of humoral immune responses in animals. Hence, developing animal antibodies capable of distinguishing highly related antigens could be challenging. To overcome the limitation imposed by the animal immune systems, we developed an in vitro methodology based on phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries for diverse antibodies as affinity reagents against closely related influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) subtypes, aiming to differentiating avian influenza virus (H5N1) from seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), for which the NPs are closely related by 90\u201394% in terms of pairwise amino acid sequence identity. We applied the methodology to attain, within four weeks, a panel of IgGs with distinguishable specificities against a group of representative NPs with pairwise amino acid sequence identities up to more than 90%, and the antibodies derived from the antibody libraries without further affinity refinement had comparable affinity of mouse antibodies to the NPs with the detection limit less than 1 nM of viral NP from lysed virus with sandwich ELISA. The panel of IgGs were capable of rapidly distinguishing infections due to virulent avian influenza virus from infections of seasonal flu, in responding to a probable emergency scenario where avian influenza virus would be transmissible among humans overlapping with the seasonal influenza infections. The results indicate that the in vitro antibody development methodology enables developing diagnostic antibodies that would not otherwise be available from animal-based antibody technologies.",

            "text": "Over the last three decades, phage display technology has been used for the display of target-specific biomarkers, peptides, antibodies, etc. Phage display-based assays are mostly limited to the phage ELISA, which is notorious for its high background signal and laborious methodology. These problems have been recently overcome by designing a dual-display phage with two different end functionalities, namely, streptavidin (STV)-binding protein at one end and a rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantigenic target at the other end. Using this dual-display phage, a much higher sensitivity in screening specificities of autoantibodies in complex serum sample has been detected compared to single-display phage system on phage ELISA. Herein, we aimed to develop a novel, rapid, and sensitive dual-display phage to detect autoantibodies presence in serum samples using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring as a sensing platform. The vertical functionalization of the phage over the STV-modified surfaces resulted in clear frequency and dissipation shifts revealing a well-defined viscoelastic signature. Screening for autoantibodies using antihuman IgG-modified surfaces and the dual-display phage with STV magnetic bead complexes allowed to isolate the target entities from complex mixtures and to achieve a large response as compared to negative control samples. This novel dual-display strategy can be a potential alternative to the time consuming phage ELISA protocols for the qualitative analysis of serum autoantibodies and can be taken as a departure point to ultimately achieve a point of care diagnostic system.",

            "text": "Traditional methodologies for detection encompass culturebased techniques and color culture medium approaches. However, these methodologies are encumbered by limitations, necessitating professional expertise, and demanding cumbersome labor and time commitments. The procedural intricacies include pre-enrichment, selective enrichment, and biochemical identification, typically leading to a confirmed outcome after 2-3 days (Bell et al., 2016). Due to the limitations present in these methods, there is a need for more efficient, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. Immunological assays, such as ELISA and immunosensors, are commonly used for bacterial detection. However, their sensitivity is limited because proteins like immunoglobulins cannot be amplified. Furthermore, nucleic acidbased assays are unable to distinguish between viable and nonviable cells, as DNA can persist in the environment long after cell viability has been lost. This creates a need for a more specific, sensitive, and convenient diagnostic method that can bridge the gap between the detection. Aptamer-based assays are utilized for the detection of pathogens and biomarkers. Aptamers synthesis is rapid compared to the antibody production, and these rapid turnaround time helps in timely diagnosis. Furthermore, they have increased stability and shelf life compared to antibodies and reduced risk of immunogenicity due to ease of modifications that increase the stability, binding affinity and functionality (Ali et al., 2019). These assays enhance detection methods by providing improved specificity and sensitivity even at lower concentrations compared to traditional methods (Aslan et al., 2023). By delivering rapid results, which are ideal for point-of-care settings, this approach enhances diagnostic efficiency across various healthcare applications (Majdinasab et al., 2022). Further, the review delineates a comprehensive analysis of the diverse categories of apta-sensors. (Figure 2, Table 1).",

            "text": "Phage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap. Efficient biopanning selection leads to the isolation of ligands with unique, specific, and desired functional characteristics. Phage antibody display offers multiple platforms for the use of antigen-binding; however, the diversity and stability of the library still need to be improved. \n\nIn the past few years, the need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant diseases has increased. This is due, on the one hand, to the growth of the disease in general, including the unprecedented spread of the new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2, and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of current biomedical diagnostic methods. For example, because of puncture invasiveness, a tissue biopsy cannot always be performed, and the results of a single biopsy often cannot provide sufficient information in real-time to diagnose the disease. PCR is currently one of the most popular tools for the rapid detection of viral infections. Nucleic acid-based virus detection usually provides high sensitivity but may require trained personnel and be time-consuming and expensive. The use of isothermal amplification systems may reduce equipment costs, making these systems indispensable when highperformance and rapid cycling testing are required. Alternatives to PCR are immunoassays, which offer reliability and cost-effectiveness. In addition, some immunoassays can be modified with lateral flow technology, which greatly speeds up the generation of results. However, immunoassays are usually inferior in sensitivity to PCR. Along with these methods, the use of next-generation sequencing can provide promising results. In addition, the ability to sequence a large number of viral genomes will provide researchers with expanded information about them and will help in tracing infections. \n\nCharacteristics such as high throughput, ease of use, and short running time play an important part, especially in viral outbreaks, in addition to the general requirement for the accuracy, validity, and specificity of viral assays. This strategy enables simple, cheap, rapid, and sensitive detection of specific pathogens, which shows great potential in virus analysis in situ.",

            "text": "The mapping of polyclonal antibody responses to identify individual infection-specific epitopes is vital for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the design of effective vaccines. However, as mentioned the mapping of polyclonal antibody responses is not easy to accomplish as they are extremely complex, often involving the generation of a wide range of distinct antibodies against a diverse range of pathogen epitopes. The advent of NGPD has provided a highly efficient screening method for phage-ligands that can succeed in identifying the enrichment of specific phage-peptides even when a low number of panning rounds are performed. The NGPD method is now being applied to the identification of epitopes in polyclonal sera. With regard to infectious diseases, in a very recent study, Xu et al. demonstrated the application of NGPD to map B-cell responses to viral infections 23 . They used a bespoke T7 phage-library displaying overlapping 56mer peptides covering the entire proteomes of known human viruses. They applied NGPD to map whether human polyclonal antibodies enriched peptides from a virus. The method, termed VirScan, could show high correlation between virus sequence enrichment during phage panning and data from established serological assays. However, when assaying human populations it was noted that the detection of some viruses was much lower than expected from epidemiological or vaccination data. The study noted possible reasons for this discrepancy, namely the method is limited to the display of protein epitopes and will not represent other antigenic macromolecules, it will not represent discontinuous epitopes made up of combinations of regions beyond the 56mer peptides and will not represent post-translational modifications of proteins. However, the study does comprehensively demonstrate that NGPD can be used to map epitopes within polyclonal sera.\n\nIn the present study, sera from pigs infected with S. Typhimurium were probed with an unbiased nonapeptide phage library containing both constrained and linear peptides. The panning strategy compared phage-peptide binding to polyclonal antibody samples from each of 12 pigs taken before and after infection and used a two-proportion Z test analysis to define specific enrichment of a particular peptide against an IgG sample from an infected animal.

There are several advantages in using this approach: 1) the binding strength of the phage-displayed recombinant antibodies due to their larger size is greater than that for a phage-displayed peptide, resulting in better specificity, selectivity and potency of antigen binding; 2) the ability to use the E-tagged scFv antibodies to affinity-purify and conjugate lung cancer-specific antibody/antigen for subsequent characterization; 3) the affinity-purified  recombinant antibodies can be labeled with biotin, dyes, enzymes, or conjugated to beads, and be used in a variety of inexpensive immunoassay formats. We successfully selected for scFv recombinant antibodies reactive with circulating IgM autoantibodies obtained from adenocarcinoma patient but not normal human samples. In a validation set of patients matched by age, gender and smoking status, 6 scFv discriminated serum samples from stage I adeno-carcinoma and no-cancer control at very significant statistical level. \n\nA novel homogeneous bridging scFv assay was developed using MSD technology. This technology has demonstrated more sensitivity and broad dynamic range and it requires significantly less volume of serum sample than ELISA, which is commonly used in similar serological studies. The ability to multiplexing is also benefit over standard ELISA. In contrast to other multiplex  platforms, such as Luminex, the MSD technology is advantageous because it does not require chemical conjugation of antigens to solid phase, therefore minimizing the potential impact on immunogenicity of tested antibody. This platform can be used in multi-array format for the high-throughput screening. To our best knowledge, we were the first to develop this type of assay using scFv for the autoantibody detection.",

            "text": ". bovis is a member of the MTB complex and is promiscuous in host specificity. It can infect alpacas, llamas, dogs and cats that can then transmit to the animal owners. The UK has not been able to contain the disease despite several radical measures being carried out to control the natural reservoir populations. Three months are required to diagnose M. bovis infection and it costs $140 per sample. Differentiation between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis infections are necessary as the former is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide. \n\nTraditional approaches to generate serological response tests either use non-pathogenic BCG strains or heat-killed/chemically-inactivated pathogens. These harsh conditions damage the important cell surface conformational epitopes which are not represented or maintained during detection. The novel approach tried by Linda Stewart (University of Belfast, UK) was to use gamma-irradiated pathogenic strains to develop M. bovis specific binders. 109 The whole-cell or ethanol extracted surface antigens were used and both polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies were raised using phage display technology. The outcome of this was an array of binders that were characterized by ELISA and immunofluorescent staining. The main aim of their efforts was to develop a diagnostic assay that would use the binders for disease detection that could differentiate between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis infections unlike the commercially available kits in the market at present. \n\nGustavo Moreira (Technische Universit\u20ac at Braunschweig, Germany), discussed the use of phage display for biomarker identification and generation of human antibodies for diagnostics and therapy. Antibody phage display involves an in vitro process, which does not involve the immune system. The process begins with insertion of the antibody genes into phage genome, which is then expressed as a fusion protein displayed on the outer surface of the phage. The next stage is called panning, where the antigen is interrogated with the library of antibodies that has been created. Identification of positively binding antibodies is performed by ELISA, immunoblot or flow cytometry. 110 . tuberculosis secretes a protein called Antigen 85 (Ag85).",

However, traditional antibody-based detection technique has several drawbacks, including expensive cost, poor physical and chemical stability, and large size, which limits its application for certain disease biomarkers. To address these drawbacks, some alternatives to antibody have been developed such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and aptamers. MIPs can be produced at low cost with high reproducibility and stability, which have been used for the detection of human rhinovirus serotype 2 and tobacco mosaic virus. [20,21] Aptamers are another recently-developed alternatives to replace antibodies. [22] Aptamers are usually isolated by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique.

In this study, a novel Nanobody-based bioassay was developed for rapid, low-cost and sensitive detection of the influenza H5N1 virus. Nanobodies specific to H5N1 virus were selected from a VHH library by phage display technology. In this system, the biotinylated Nanobody was directionally captured by streptavidin coated on ELISA plate, which can specifically capture the H5N1 virus. Another Nanobody conjugated with HRP was used as a detector. A novel directional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for H5N1 using specific Nanobodies was established and compared to the conventional undirected ELISA assay. We have successfully constructed a high quality phage display Nanobody library and isolated two Nanobodies against H5N1 with high affinity and specificity. These two Nanobodies were further used to prepare the biosensor detection system. This streptavidin-biotin-based directional double Nanobodies sandwich ELISA for H5N1 detection showed superiority over the commonly undirectional ELISA protocol. The linear range of detection for standards in this immunoassay was approximately 50\u20131000 ng/mL and the detection limit was 14.1 ng/mL. The average recoveries of H5N1 virus from human serum samples were in the range from 94.58% to 114.51%, with a coefficient of variation less than 6.5%. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the proposed detection system is an alternative diagnostic tool that enables a rapid, inexpensive, sensitive and specific detection of the influenza virus.",

            "text": "In contrast to random peptide display, gene-fragment phage display libraries offer an alternative that can simplify analyses especially when one focuses on a specific antigen(s). The genefragment phage display library can represent a gene [29], a cDNA [19,24,29,45,85,104] or even a total genome [47,54] that encodes the ligand of interest. The DNA is reduced to smaller gene fragments (50-400 bp), usually by DNaseI-mediated random digestion or by gene fragment synthesis [47,66,92]. These are cloned into the 5 0 terminus of the coat protein gene of the phage. The gene-fragment phage display library is then used for biopanning against polyclonal serum or specific mAbs, and has resulted in the isolation of peptides which enable one to determine the corresponding epitopes of the Abs tested. These selected peptides can also be utilized as biomarkers for various applications. Novel biomarkers, such as circulating (auto) antibody signatures, may improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer [19,104], autoimmune [54,85] and infectious-diseases [48]. For example, Chatterjee et al. utilized a cDNA phage display library to identify diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer [19]. Their 65 selected clones interacted with sera from 32 ovarian cancer patients but not with sera from 25 healthy women or 14 patients suffering from other benign or malignant gynecologic diseases. Thus, the panel of biomarkers was found efficient for detection of ovarian cancer. However, this platform has limitations as well. The abundance of fragments that are cloned are often out of reading frame, consequently the identification of the epitopes is not straightforward. For example, only 12 out of the 65 clones, selected by Chatterjee et al., could clearly be shown to correspond to linear segments of known antigens. The remaining clones were either unidentified or had weak homology with known proteins and thus were assumed to represent mimetics of more complicated conformational epitopes.\n\nAlthough these libraries are of limited diversity (as opposed to random peptide libraries), this approach has been proven as inexpensive and high-throughput. Moreover, this method allows",

            "text": "Antigen detection techniques are instrumental in biology and medicine to diagnose diseases, evaluate disease severity, and even predict patient outcomes. For example, clinicians currently use biomarker detection to diagnose and monitor diseases such as tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metastatic cancers [1][2][3][4][5]. Additionally, biomarker detection techniques are used in non-disease applications such as pregnancy and blood tests [6,7]. The most simple and common antigen detection technique is the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [2,5]. In a traditional ELISA, primary antibodies specific to the antigen of interest are combined with biological samples. Then, detectible secondary antibodies are added, which directly bind the primary antibodies. Finally, a color-changing substrate is added to generate a colorimetric signal, the intensity of which directly correlates with the level of target protein expression (Fig 1, left). The samples used in ELISAs often consist of immobilized antigens on the surface of a plate, but for biomarker detection in disease applications it is critical to be able to detect antigens directly on cell membranes, as overexpressed cell surface receptors distinguish diseased cells from normal cells. Moreover, the level of expression, and the percentage of cells with amplified expression, can indicate disease severity. Although ELISAs are widely used both in research and in clinical settings, they frequently lack the sensitivity necessary to detect targeted antigens expressed at low levels on cells or to detect low numbers of cells that express the targeted antigen [4,6,8]. Due to this low sensitivity, minor variations in protein expression or experimental protocol can yield inconsistent ELISA results [6]. This sensitivity issue can be attributed to a low signal-to-antigen ratio because each targeted biomolecule on the cell surface must come in direct contact with both primary and secondary antibodies to generate signal above background levels [4]. To overcome this limitation, we developed a modified ELISA that uses nanoparticles (NPs) coated with primary antibodies rather than unconjugated primary antibodies.",

            "text": "As described above, conventional diagnostic methods such as microscopy remain problematic in many settings. Thus, there is a significant need for new diagnostic techniques that are capable of displaying high specificity and sensitivity [41]. In recent decades, molecular-based diagnostic tools have become well developed, generating new strategies for diagnosis. Examples include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [42], loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [43], mass spectrometry (MS) [44], fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) [45], and single molecule array (SIMOA) technology [46]. In spite of some advantages related to their extremely good specificity, the implementation of these methods is hampered by specific limitations such as their time-consuming nature, cost, need for electricity supply, and lack of experienced technicians, especially in less well-resourced settings. These issues have been extensively reviewed [47,48]. \n\nTo address these shortcomings, immune-based assays would be ideal tools for biomarker detection in clinical diagnostic settings [49]. As the gold standard for measuring protein content in human body fluids such as blood, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) remains the predominant method for detection of antigens of interest (biomarkers) [50]. Furthermore, the invention of new point-of-care systems, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), has been a major contributor to clinical case management [51,52] patients undergoing self-monitoring at home; for instance, blood glucose reading for diabetics [53]. Many high-throughput antibody-based screening methods have been integrated across various diagnostic platforms to enable rapid identification of biomarkers that may aid individual treatment and monitoring of responses to therapy. Current multiplexed immunoassays are based on multi-marker strategies, in which high-affinity capture ligands (antibodies or proteins/peptides) are immobilized in parallel assays [54,55]. Several commercial multiplexed immunoassay platforms are available on this emerging market, including the Luminex bead-based platform [56], Meso Scale Discovery's Multi Array Technology [57], and protein array platforms from Whatman [58].",

            "text": "(3) Limited cell types: Flow cytometry is the most effective approach for analyzing cells or particles suspended in a fluid and may not be suitable for analyzing solid tissue samples or cells with thick walls. (4) Interference: Flow cytometry can be influenced by factors such as particles or contaminants in the samples, which can affect the accuracy of the results (Table 2) [118][119][120]. \n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a type of immunoassay widely used in plant pathogen detection and diagnosis (Figure 3) [121][122][123]. ELISAs can detect molecules by binding them to a solid surface, such as a microplate well, and adding an enzyme-labeled antibody that recognizes the target molecule [155]. For instance, ELISAs can detect P. syringae using antibodies that recognize specific antigens on the surface, such as the lipopolysaccharides or flagellins [156]. Some advantages of ELISAs for plant pathogen detection and diagnosis are as follows: (1) Sensitivity: ELISAs are highly sensitive and can detect very low levels of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample. This makes them useful for detecting plant pathogens in the preliminary stages when the levels of specific markers may be low. (2) Specificity: ELISAs are specific for the antibodies or antigens they are designed to detect, allowing for the accurate identification of specific plant pathogens. \n\n(3) Speed: ELISAs can be completed relatively quickly, often within a few hours, making them a convenient and efficient tool for plant pathogen diagnosis. (4) Versatility: ELISAs can be modified to detect a wide range of plant pathogens, making them versatile for plant pathogen and disease diagnosis (Table 2). Some limitations of ELISAs for plant pathogen detection and diagnosis: (1) Complexity: ELISAs require a series of steps and specialized equipment, making them more complex and time-consuming compared to other diagnostic techniques. (2) Cost: ELISAs need specialized reagents and equipment, which can make them more expensive than the other diagnostic techniques. (3) Limited scope: ELISAs are limited to detecting specific antibodies or antigens, which may not be present in all plant pathogens.",

            "text": "Antibody-based detection has traditionally focused on water-soluble protein and carbohydrate antigens, as the antigens and antibodies are all soluble in the aqueous environment of the assay. As a result, insoluble molecules such as nonpolar lipids have remained neglected and represent a novel group of antigens whose potential as disease biomarkers has not been fully explored. A further complication is that traditional hybridoma methodologies typically do not generate high affi nity antibodies against lipids due to their poor immunogenicity unless conjugated to a protein carrier that enables lipid-specifi c B-cells to obtain T-cell help ( 15 ). However, in vitro antibody selection techniques such as phage display have allowed the generation of antibodies against nonpolar lipids such as 15-ketocholestane, methyl palmitate, and 11-dehydrothromboxane (16)(17)(18). These antibodies are able to detect free insoluble lipid deposited by evaporation of the carrier organic solvent, thus avoiding the need for the lipid to be emulsifi ed in an aqueous environment. The development of such antibodies opens up the possibility of targeting such lipids as diagnostic biomarkers for point-of-care assays. \n\nIn this study, we screened a non-immune human Fab phage display library against Mtb -derived mycolic acid, and isolated four unique antibodies specifi c for the methoxy mycolic acid subclass. Concurrently, we have optimized a rapid lipid extraction protocol to enable these antibodies to detect mycolic acid present in mycobacterial culture via a simple immunoassay. We show that these antibodies are capable of distinguishing mycolic acid from common biological lipids present in most cells such as cholesterol and phospholipids as well as differentiating lipid extracts of mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial actinomycete species.",

            "text": "Notably, passive immunotherapy using anti-Als3 antibodies has been proposed as an innovative approach to combat infections caused by Candida species (Singh et al. 2019). These findings emphasize the potential of developing Als3-specific antibodies as a novel therapeutic strategy, offering significant promise for overcoming the challenges associated with C. albicans infections and improving antifungal treatment outcomes. \n\nImmunotherapy utilizing antibodies has demonstrated remarkable efficacy across a broad range of targets, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases (Wang et al. 2022). A key milestone in this field was achieved by Smith (1985) and Huse et al. (1989), who revolutionized antibody development with the invention and application of phage display technology, significantly expanding the possibilities for generating monoclonal antibodies. Since then, phage display technology has become a versatile and cost-effective platform for selecting highly specific antibodies against a variety of targets, including cancers, viruses, and bacterial pathogens (Guliy et al. 2024). This innovative approach continues to play a pivotal role in advancing immunotherapeutic strategies and has been successfully applied in diverse species, including chickens, which offer a cost-efficient and readily available alternative for monoclonal antibody production (Yang et al. 2024). In addition to intact IgG antibodies, recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies are gaining significant recognition in the biotechnology market due to their superior tissue penetration, smaller size, and ease of production via phage display technology. These scFv antibodies are increasingly utilized in both diagnostic and therapeutic applications, underscoring their growing importance in expanding the scope and versatility of immunotherapy. Given their cost-effectiveness and accessibility, chickens provide a practical and widely available host for constructing scFv antibody libraries (Park et al. 2005). These libraries enable the efficient screening of high-affinity binders targeting various pathogens, thereby enhancing their potential applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. \n\nBuilding on the findings of previous studies, we propose that Als3 in C. albicans represents a promising target for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

At the same time, there has been a continuous stream of improvements and novel developments of nucleic-acid detection methods, including the emergence of isothermal amplification methods such as rolling circle amplification (RCA) [10]. The combination of these technologies, leading first to the development of immuno-PCR (iPCR) and, more recently proximity ligation (PLA) and extension (PEA) assays, couples the detection specificity of the antibody with the amplification power of PCR or RCA. This arsenal is beginning to provide researchers with a powerful tool for the detection and quantification of cellular, pathogen and GMO-specific proteins as well as diagnostic biomarkers [11]. This emergence of proximity assays into the main stream of proteomic research is reflected in the number of papers citing the technology, which have increased fourfold between 2010 and 2014 from 41 to 156, with",

This device detects magnetic field oscillations caused by monitoring the presence of super paramagnetic beads bound to E. coli-immobilized antigens. A significant advantage of this method is that the beads are strongly stable, permitting repetition of the assays several times [30]. An electrochemical biosensor, which employs DNA probes for the 16S rRNA of the most common uropathogens, was tested in a prospective clinical study in patients with neurogenic bladder. The authors report that the biosensor assay specificity and positive predictive values were of 100 % with a pathogen detection sensitivity of approximately 89 %, yielding a 76 % negative predictive value. A positive aspect of this device is that it allows the samples to be tested within 1-2 h of collection; however, the test failed to detect pathogens at a concentration of 4-3 10 4 CFU/mL or less [31]. \n\nAlthough the important advances in molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases are incontestable, serological techniques are still the principal application in infectious diseases.

While numerous assays and methods have been explored that are suitable for laboratory utilization, detection in the field is often complicated by requirements for functionality in austere environments, where limited cold-chain facilities exist. In an effort to overcome these assay limitations for Bacillus anthracis, one of the most recognizable threats, a series of single domain antibodies (sdAbs) were isolated from a phage display library prepared from immunized llamas. Characterization of target specificity, affinity, and thermal stability was conducted for six sdAb families isolated from rounds of selection against the bacterial spore. The protein target for all six sdAb families was determined to be the S-layer protein EA1, which is present in both vegetative cells and bacterial spores. All of the sdAbs examined exhibited a high degree of specificity for the target bacterium and its spore, with affinities in the nanomolar range, and the ability to refold into functional antigen-binding molecules following several rounds of thermal denaturation and refolding. This research demonstrates the capabilities of these sdAbs and their potential for integration into current and developing assays and biosensors.",

This method harnesses the power of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technology to detect a wide range of biomolecules in saliva, providing valuable insights into various health conditions. ELISA-based saliva tests have been explored in the diagnosis of numerous diseases, including infectious diseases and cancer [119]. Saliva contains a wealth of biomarkers, including nucleic acid, proteins, cytokines and antibodies, reflecting both local and systemic changes associated with HNSCC. ELISA, a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay, can detect and quantify these biomarkers in saliva samples [108,226]. Several key biomarkers, such as salivary proteins (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, cytokeratins and interleukins) and cancer-associated autoantibodies, have demonstrated promising diagnostic potential [28,227].

Current routine diagnostics tend to be time consuming and require infrastructure which is not ideal for \ue103eld use.

Bacteriophages offer unique features which could be utilized to create novel, cheap and effective diagnostics for bacterial pathogens. The assays discussed in this review have the advantage of high host-speci\ue103city, similar to antibody-based detection assays, although with signi\ue103cantly cheaper large-scale production costs. Current bacteriophage-based assays are designed to detect a speci\ue103c host, however, diagnostic assays capable of detecting and discerning between a wide range of pathogens simultaneously is of great clinical and industrial utility. Future research on bacteriophage diagnostics could yield assays capable of detecting and discerning between multiple bacterial pathogens. This could be achieved through use of bacteriophages with altered host ranges or simulations use of multiple bacteriophages to encompass a larger host range in combination with various detection modalities. Bacteriophages represent an untapped biomass which offer novel tools for bacterial detection, as the global amount of bacteriophage particles has been estimated at 10 31 . The enormous potential offered by phage-based diagnostics warrants further optimization and development.

            "text": "Although these heterogeneous-reaction-based methods have been providing acceptable support for clinical diagnosis, antibody/antigen determination still requires novel methodologies that are more applicable for early molecular event detection with better sensitivity and easier operation [19]. Biosensors are bioanalytical devices integrating biorecognition elements and suitable transducers, which could be further designed with various signal amplification strategies to obtain extremely high sensitivity [2]. With plenty of advantages, such as strong specificity to targets, rapid analysis, high accuracy, easy operation, and low cost, biosensors have expansive applications for diverse targets, including cyclic drugs [20], proteins [21][22][23], nucleic acids [24][25][26][27], and cyclic tumor cells [28][29][30]. Immunosensors have played a crucial role in the determination of tumor markers [31][32][33], significantly improving early diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers. Molecular identification unit is the basis of specific determination, which specifically recognizes and captures the target, and then induces a series of physical or chemical changes. These changes could be converted to detectable optical or electrical signals by the transducers. Modern electrical and optical techniques have shown unique properties for the construction of biosensing platform. With a combination of diverse nanomaterials, more and more novel biosensors have shown excellent properties, which can well meet the demands of clinical diagnosis. Moreover, the portability of biosensors even further enables the development of point-of-care (POC) devices [34], which is proficient for home use, as well as the continuous monitoring of treatment efficiency. \n\nIn this review, we will focus on the development of biosensors for protein detection, including fabrication procedures, combination of signal amplification, utilization of various detection techniques and methodologies (Section 2). Protein biosensing platforms are always universal for all kinds of proteins based on proper optimization. Antibody biosensors with potential applicability for clinical diagnosis for the detection of biomarkers of infectious diseases and AIDs and for the evaluation of vaccine immunity are then summarized (Section 3).",

            "text": "The use of the microarray format for phage display cancer peptide libraries for autoantibody screening permits an objective identification and quantification not possible by other means. Still, the approach is rather cumbersome and laborintensive when compared with the use of recombinant protein microarrays. The technique requires considerable effort and resolution. Moreover, the identification of inserted sequences led in most of the cases to mimotopes with no clear protein assignation. All these factors make difficult its widespread use and may explain the relatively low number of reports that have applied this strategy so far. However, protein and phage microarrays have enabled the discovery of relatively large panels of proteins recognized by autoantibodies in colorectal cancer. The number of these TAAs vastly increases the number and prevalence of those antigens previously identified in cancer patients by other approaches (10). Still, we do not know yet how many proteins become autoantibody targets in cancer patients and the molecular basis for this autoimmunity.\n\nAs a novelty, this report demonstrates, for the first time, the correspondence between phage-inserted peptides and the corresponding recombinant proteins. Recombinant MST1 and SULF1 proteins were able to compete and displace antibody binding to the phages in ELISA assays. Moreover, they increased the predictive accuracy of the assay. This is an important step to support the reliability of this technology. The classifier using four combined phages and two proteins resulted in high specificity (70%) and sensitivity (82.6%) for  CRC sera, improving CEA prediction capacity. Combination with CEA did not improve significantly the diagnostic accuracy of the panel detector (supplemental Fig. S4). The addition of sera from other tumors to the validation step did not change the prediction power of the panel, stressing the value of this approach. Specificity of the test was confirmed by the low AUC obtained after comparing healthy sera from other non-CRC, cancer sera. The significance of this study was to develop a diagnostic assay useful for identification of early adenocarcinomas in CRC, with a bias-corrected AUC of 0.786 for stages A\u03e9B. Moreover, preliminary data seem to support that this panel could also discriminate very",

            "text": "Rapid, high-throughput, and accurate detection of cancer biomarkers is essential for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Rapid detection plays a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes, and efficient management of diseases relies on timely diagnostics. Highthroughput detection techniques enable the simultaneous analysis of large numbers of samples, which makes the diagnostic process faster and more efficient. Antibody-based immunoassays, which rely on the principle of antigen-specific binding of antibodies with high selectivity, have been widely used for the sensitive and accurate quantification of target antigens. Immunoassays leverage the high affinity and specificity of antibodies to detect even trace amounts of specific biomarkers, making them essential tools in diagnostics, including the detection of cancer biomarkers, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [1][2][3][4]. \n\nThe enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most commonly used immunoassay platform that employs antibodies for detecting antigens [5]. Direct ELISA uses enzyme-conjugated antibodies against the antigen, and the enzyme catalyzes a substrate reaction, resulting in an increase in absorbance [6]. Indirect ELISA uses a pair of antibodies: a primary antibody against the antigen and an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody. Various enzyme-conjugated universal antibodies that recognize the Fc region of primary antibodies and with a peptide tag attached to the primary antibody are available. If an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody is not available, a secondary antibody and an enzyme-conjugated tertiary antibody can be used. However, the need for secondary and/or tertiary antibodies for indirect ELISA is not cost-effective, and the additional reaction and washing steps are time-consuming. Although direct ELISA offers the advantages of shorter assay time and greater convenience due to the absence of secondary or tertiary antibody reactions, enzyme-conjugated antibodies are sometimes not commercially available. Moreover, in-house generation of enzyme-conjugated antibodies often results in low conjugation efficiency [7][8][9]. This process can be inefficient and resource-intensive, leading to higher costs and reduced overall effectiveness.",

            "text": "Human parechoviruses (PeVs) are common viruses that are associated with a variety of diseases from mild gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms to severe central nervous system infections. Until now there has not been antibodies for visualizing parechovirus infection. We used E. coli recombinant PeV-A1-VP0 protein as a target in phage display single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library panning. Three rounds of panning allowed identification and isolation of several candidate scFv clones, which tested positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against VP0. Three scFv clones (scFv-55, -59 and -71) with different CDR-3 sequences were further purified and tested in ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) against a set of PeV-A1 isolates and a few isolates representing PeV types 2\u20136. In IFA, all three scFv binders recognized twenty PeV-A1 isolates. ScFv-55 and -71 also recognized clinical representatives of PeV types 1\u20136 both in IFA and in capture ELISA, while scFv-59 only recognized PeV-A1, -A2 and -A6. PeV-A1-VP0 (Harris strain) sequence was used to generate a peptide library, which allowed identification of a putative unique conformational antibody epitope with fully conserved flanking regions and a more variable core VVTYDSKL, shared between the scFv antibodies. Sequencing of the VP0 region of virus samples and sequence comparisons against parechoviral sequences in GenBank revealed 107 PeV-A1, -A3, -A8, -A17, -A (untyped) sequences with this exact epitope core sequence, which was most dominant among PeV-A1 isolates. These data suggest the first-time isolation of broad range phage display antibodies against human parechoviruses that may be used in diagnostic antibody development.",

            "text": "Phage display technology is the most popular method to isolate antigen-binding clones [16]. Although camels, llamas and dromedaries have all been immunized to produce antigen binders in many studies, [17][18][19] this routine way is often unrealistic when the antigens are toxic, lethal, transmissible, of low immunogenicity, or even nonimmunogenic small molecular compounds [16,20]. In addition, the immunization process is timeconsuming and normally takes months to raise a satisfactorily immune response [16]. Alternatively, na\u00efve phage display libraries could solve the above problems. Nonimmunized camels can be used to generate unbiased or non-immune libraries, from which antigen binders of interest can be selected. \n\nIn this study, based on the VHHs genes, which were amplified from the mRNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of twenty four non-immunized bactrian camels and a spleen from another non-immunized bactrian camel, we successfully constructed a large na\u00efve phage-displayed library with great diversity. The library contains 6.86 \u00d7 10 11 clones, with an insertion rate of clones having a VHH of nearly 100%. Then Nbs against human procalcitonin (PCT) were isolated from this phage-displayed library. PCT is a highly valuable diagnostic biomarker of bacterial infections, which is frequently used as a reliable marker to support the risk evaluation of seriously sick people progressing to severe sepsis and septic shock [21,22]. Furthermore, by comparing the PCT Nbs from an immune phage-displayed library constructed in our previous study, [23] the na\u00efve library derived PCT Nbs showed comparable affinity and antigen-binding thermostability at 37\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. In addition, two Nbs recognizing unique epitopes of PCT, were used to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the bacterial protein. Consequently, the Nbs from the naive library were successfully used for capture and detection of native PCT in the ELISA based diagnostic assay allowing the sensitive measurement of the disease marker.",

            "text": "Antibodies are the most preferred tools and are widely used for disease diagnostics and therapy. There is an increasing need for more stable and specific antibodies in the medical and diagnostic fields [37][38]. However, conventional hybridoma monoclonal antibody technology is laborious, expensive, time-consuming and has difficulty keeping up with the current pace of recognition of targeted antigen structures. The use of antibody phage display on a llama non-immune library provides a reliable, cost-effective and fast option for generating VHH antibodies. Non-immune libraries have many advantages in that the time-consuming immunization and library construction protocols can be omitted for each new target [39]. VHH antibodies are being researched for multiple pharmaceutical applications and have potential for use in the treatment of some diseases [40][41][42]. This is the first study that has successfully developed a reliable and controllable protocol for nanobody screening against DENV2-rNS1 protein from a nonimmune llama VHH library followed by the expression of the nanobodies by E. coli (BL21). \n\nAfter purification, sequence alignment of the VHH antibodies by the IMGT system revealed some sequence homology of the framework regions and residues within the two complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2) with Lama glama (IGHV1S3*01, IGHJ4*01). However, the CDR3 regions, previously known to represent a highly antigenic recognition core, were different and did not show homology with the other sequences. Based on these findings, the high affinity of VHH antibodies might be due to these novel and longer CDR3 regions while other CDRs and some contact residues of the framework region may bind opportunistically with the antigen [31][32]. \n\nThe fast, user-friendly and cost-effective immunochromatographic assay, which is based on rapid diagnostic kits for NS1 detection in patient's serum, provides opportunities for point-ofcare diagnosis, especially in developing countries [13,43]. The selection of well characterized antibodies is crucial for the development of biosensors based on immunoassay. Currently, the frequency of dengue infection has increased because of warmer weather conditions and frequent international travel.",

            "text": "The lateral flow assay (LFA) is an extensively used paper-based platform for the rapid and on-site detection of different analytes. The method is user-friendly with no need for sophisticated operation and only includes adding sample. Generally, antibodies are employed as the biorecognition elements in the LFA. However, antibodies possess several disadvantages including poor stability, high batch-to-batch variation, long development time, high price and need for ethical approval and cold chain. Because of these limitations, aptamers screened by an in vitro process can be a good alternative to antibodies as biorecognition molecules in the LFA. In recent years, aptamer-based LFAs have been investigated for the detection of different analytes in point-of-care diagnostics. In this review, we summarize the applications of aptamer technology in LFAs in clinical diagnostic rapid tests for the detection of biomarkers, microbial analytes, hormones and antibiotics. Performance, advantages and drawbacks of the developed assays are also discussed.",

            "text": "Biosensors for diagnosis of COVID-19 by assay of anti-COVID-19 antigen-specific antibodies have a common sense for confirmation of specific antibody presence as a result of the disease or for measuring of seroconversion initiated by vaccination or the disease. The specific antibodies are not a tool for the diagnosis of an undergoing disease in an acute phase because specific antibodies are created after a delay of several days and highly specific antibodies such as IgG are presented in the blood even later. The first phases of an infection disease (incubation and prodromal) are typically not covered by antibody production, while the antibodies remain up to the convalescence phase of the disease and further while other biochemical and immunochemical markers gain their normal values. The practical relevance of biosensors as tools for point-of-care testing is lower compared to the COVID-19 antigens. However, such biosensors would improve the quality of care by faster and more accurate decisions for revaccination and identification of the most endangered people by the disease development. \n\nCady and coworkers developed a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonic biosensor for the detection of antibodies specific to spike S1 protein, spike S1S2 protein, the and N protein as these proteins were immobilized on a biosensor chip [84]. This type of spectroscopic assay exerted 100% selectivity and sensitivity for an assay of specific IgG and selectivity of 100% and sensitivity of 87% for an assay of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples from human volunteers. The other specific antibodies, including immunoglobulins IgM and IgA, can also be analyzed. The assay was also fully correlated with standard ELISA. In another application of a non-linear optical method, a surface plasmon resonance biosensor was developed for the assay of IgG, IgM and IgA specific to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 [85]. The biosensor contained immobilized S protein and was verified on 102 human samples in which the presence of anti-S protein antibodies and their isotype were measured in a single step.",

However, the specific antibodies in a pAb reagent (antiserum) usually constitute less than 1% of the total amount of antibodies. Thus, pAb produced by standard routes often show crossreactivity and lack of reproducibility upon re-immunizations with the same antigen, which makes these reagents less attractive as a renewable resource.\n\nmAbs have a defined single binding epitope, which makes them attractive for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. mAbs are currently the most commonly used immunoreagents in diagnostic applications (23). However, because monoclonal reagents recognize a single epitope of a protein, it is difficult to generate antibodies that can be used as single and defined reagents across whole platforms of functional and detection assays, where the proteins often are denaturated in different ways, such as with detergents or formalin. In addition, time-consuming screening is needed to generate mAbs, which render them less suitable for large-scale efforts. recAbs are usually selected by utilizing phage display technologies (21), or other selection principles, such as ribosomal display (20). Much of the in vitro selection technology has been based on recAb fragments, especially scFvs and Fabs (24), but alternative protein scaffolds have also been used (25). Nonproteinaceous binding ligands, such as the in vitro selected aptamers (26), have also been successfully utilized for specific recognition of target",

            "text": "Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are ubiquitous viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. Like their eukaryote relatives, phages can consist of either double-stranded or single-stranded DNA or RNA genomes. This diversity of phages can be seen in both their morphology and genome architecture, with genome size that ranges from ~3-500 kb. First described independently in 1915 by Frederick Twort and in 1917 by Felix d'Herelle, we now know phages are the most abundant taxon in the biosphere with an estimated 10 31 viral particles. Since their discovery, phages have had an enormous impact on our understanding of genetics, molecular biology, bacterial evolution, and marine and soil ecology. Furthermore, the study of bacterial defenses against phages have led to powerful scientific tools including restriction enzymes and the revolutionary gene editing tools of the CRISPR-Cas system. The discovery of restriction enzyme system was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine in 1978 and in 2020, CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing application was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \n\nPhages were the first to have their entire genomes sequenced and, indeed, the use of phage derived products such as T7 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, M13 vectors were critical in whole genome sequencing projects from phages to humans. Phages themselves have played an immense role in developing tools and methods for pathogen detection and identification. From the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) gold standard for \"phage typing\" bacterial isolates to the development of the phage display system for discovery of binding peptides and antibodies, researchers have found creative ways to exploit phages for novel pathogen detection platforms. There are many reviews on the use of phages for pathogen detection using different assays, platforms and biosensors [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. This review will focus on how phages have been exploited for detection of those pathogens that are of most concern due to their history and potential for use as biowarfare and bioterrorism agents.",

            "text": "We identified several putative antibody biomarkers for Gram-negative pathogens by using a microarray encompassing the majority of proteins from the Y. pestis proteome. Rabbit antibodies produced against the proteomes extracted from several Gram-negative bacteria recognized Y. pestis proteins that clustered into three general categories: proteins recognized in all Gram-negative species examined (crossreactive proteins), combinations of proteins unique to one pathogen (fingerprint), and proteins unique to only one pathogen (signature). Antibodies from non-human primates that recovered from a potentially lethal aerosol challenge with Y. pestis recognized several proteins in common with antibodies produced against the extracted bacterial proteome, supporting the importance of these proteins as potential disease biomarkers. Additional unique biomarkers of disease were identified in sera from vaccinated or acutely infected nonhuman primates prior to overt sepsis. \n\nThe most useful sepsis biomarkers should enable diagnosis at the earliest stage of infection and provide a means for identifying the specific etiological agent. Our results illustrate the application of proteome microarrays for the discovery of new diagnostic biomarkers. There are previously reported tests for diagnosing plague in the field and clinic that should be noted. For example, an assay based on the release of the capsular protein CaF1 into serum during infection was used to confirm epidemic cases (25). Further, the detection of soluble CaF1 in sputum of patients provided a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonic plague as early as the 2nd day after the onset of the symptoms of plague (26), although seroconversion occurs 7 days after disease onset (27). The low Ca 2\u03e9 response V-antigen of Y. pestis was also used in diagnostic assays (28), and an assay based on detection of the plasminogen activator protein of Y. pestis was reported (29). However, these previously described diagnostic tests for plague relied on antigens that are not expressed by all isolates (30) or that may not reach detectable levels before onset of lifethreatening disease. Thus, increased assay specificity and sensitivity may result from inclusion of the provisional antibody biomarkers we report here.",

At the same time, other methods are based on the detection of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) in aa quantitative and qualitative manner [2] and are amplified using polymerase chain reaction technology (PCR) [3], the critical development of a point-of-care diagnostic assay for disease detection, monitoring, and management. Such point-of-care includes tests that analyze samples in field hospitals, outside clinical laboratory settings, and are often performed by clinical staff without laboratory training for quick results, and such systems are based on lateral flow immunoassays [4][5][6]. Viral isolation is the gold standard procedure and the most sensitive approach, even though it takes 3-7 days and is tedious [7]. Anyway, the serological examinations of viral antibodies against viral antigens are less sensitive and non-specific [8]. Nanosensors are quantitative procedures employed to identify numerous infectious illnesses in straightforward, real-time, and effective methods [9]. The design of glucose oxidase biosensors reported by Clark and Lyon was one of the earliest biosensor reports at the beginning of the sixties [10]. Biosensors consist of bioreceptor, transducers, and signal processing systems as three primary parts [11]. Bioreceptor in biosensors may selectively interact with the biomarker utilizing monoclonal antibodies, glycan, nucleic acid, lectin, enzyme, tissue, or entire cells, as depicted in Fig. 1 [12]. The transducer converts these interactions to a quantifiable and measurable signal and then analyses and reports qualitative and quantitative pathogen identification using obtained signals [13,14]. The target analyte comprises antigenic viruses, which might be the entire virion, virus capsid proteins, virusspecific antibodies, and viral nucleic acids. \n\nBiosensors have been prepared and functionalized using nanoparticles to improve the specificity and selectivity of the detection of target molecules.",

            "text": "Gonorrhea is one of the most common, but still hidden and insidious, sexually transmitted diseases caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococci). However, the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhea are hampered by antigenic variability among gonococci, the lack of acquired immunity, and antimicrobial resistance. Further, strains resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, the last line of defense, represent a growing threat, which prompted us to develop gonococci-specific diagnostic antibodies with broad-spectrum binding to gonococci strains to generate gonorrhea-detecting reagents. This study reports the identification of gonococci antibodies via bio-panning on gonococci cells using scFv-phage libraries. Reformatting the lead scFv-phage Clones 1 and 4 to a multivalent scFv1-Fc-scFv4 maxibody increased the sensitivity by up to 20-fold compared to the single scFv-Fc (maxibody) alone. Moreover, the multivalent maxibody showed broader cross-reactivity with clinical isolates and the ceftriaxone antibiotic-resistant World Health Organization (WHO) reference strain L. In contrast, the selected antibodies in the scFv-phage, maxibody, and multivalent maxibody did not bind to N. sicca, N. meningitides, and N. lactamica, suggesting the clinical and pharmaceutical diagnostic value of these selected antibodies for gonorrheal infections. The present study illustrates the advantages and potential application of multivalent maxibodies to develop rapid and sensitive diagnostic reagents for infectious diseases and cancer.",

            "text": "In recent years, advances in technologies have been made with a view to providing solutions for existing diagnostic challenges of dengue virus infections. In the current review, we describe the potential diagnostic applications of new technologies based on biosensors, microarrays, microfluidics, and nanobodies. The utility of several emerging technologies has been reported previously [98,99]. \n\nWe highlight the diagnostic opportunities for dengue virus infection emanating from biosensor, microarray and microfluidic-based technologies. In the literature search, we observed that several emerging diagnostic platforms can use a wide range of diagnostic signatures for dengue virus such as complementary DNA, non-structural protein 1 (NS1), envelope domain-III (EDIII) and immunoglobulin M antibody (Table 3). All these signatures can be used as biomarkers for acute-phase dengue virus infection and facilitate the early identification of dengue-infected individuals which is crucial for infection control and clinical management (Ref). In addition, it has been demonstrated that clinical samples other than blood such as saliva and urine can be used as diagnostic specimens for acute or late-stage dengue virus infection [104,106] and this can extend the narrow window period of dengue diagnosis due to low viral load after viremic phase of infection [28]. Moreover, it has been shown that several emerging diagnostic platforms can be tailored for the simultaneous detection of multiple dengue virus serotypes in a single assay (multiplex) and used at the point of care (POC) for rapid detection of dengue cases that would be vital during outbreaks (Table 3).

            "text": "T he complexity and multifactorial nature of chronic diseases requires the measurement of multiple biomarkers to provide robust information for both diagnosis and prognosis. 1 For this reason, there is a large interest in developing reliable biomarker detection systems suitable for clinical use. These systems should preferably combine high sensitivity, wide dynamic detection range, and multiplexing capacity in complex fluids with robust quality control opportunities. To our knowledge, considering the challenging demands, presently no system adequately meets these requirements. \n\nTraditionally, biomarker measurements are performed using the ELISA format in both research and clinical settings. Although its benefits are clinically proven, the ELISA assay comes with a number of disadvantages: it requires relatively large sample volumes, has a small dynamic detection range necessitating the use of a dilution series, and has only limited multiplexing capabilities. Furthermore, the need for expensive kits and bulky automation limits its usefulness for point-of-care applications. 2 Therefore, many alternative biomarker assays have been developed. 3 These can be separated into 2D planar assays and bead suspension assays. The 2D planar assays, such as Mesoscale Discovery and Searchlight, use a similar approach to the standard ELISA, with variation in the detection method (electro-chemiluminescent, chemiluminescent, fluorescent, or colorimetric). They apply a microarray format, allowing for multiplex measurements in small sample volumes. Despite the frequent use and the improvement over standard ELISAs, reports show a high interassay variability, 4,5 unreliability, 4,6,7 and lack of quality control opportunities. 5,7 Bead suspension assays are also often used for multiplex applications, especially in research settings. Of these, flow cytometry bead arrays and Luminex are the most common. These assays show excellent sensitivity over an acceptable dynamic detection range; 8 however, reports show a high interassay CV at low concentrations, resulting in unreliable results. 9 Also, the inherent increase in nonspecific interactions in suspension places a restraint on the multiplexing capacity. 10 To overcome these limitations, new platforms are being developed that combine advanced surface chemistry and nanotechnology to create sophisticated sensing platforms. 11",

            "text": "Serology plays an important role in the diagnosis of various disease processes, especially for infectious diseases [1]. In most individuals, infection with a pathogen leads to the production of pathogen-specific antibodies. These antibodies can then be probed to identify the etiology of infection and disease. Various stages of disease and location of infection lead to the generation of different antibody isotypes which provides an additional layer of information. For example, IgM is produced during acute infection [2], IgG is detected systemically long after pathogen clearance [3], while IgA is generated mostly following mucosal infections [4] and IgE is seen in the case of allergies and chronic infections. Detailed information on antibody isotypes and location of detection not only possess diagnostic value, but also provide insight into immunity against re-infection. \n\nNucleic acid-based molecular techniques for the detection of infectious pathogens have revolutionized diagnostic medicine. However, their utility is only apparent within a short window for acute infectious diseases and that too if sampled at the correct site. Furthermore, molecular techniques are associated with higher costs and processing time, which are not ideal for low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) settings or rapid diagnosis. In contrast, the parallel use of pathogen-specific antibody detection can be rapid, cheap, and allow the identification of infectious etiology even after the pathogen has been cleared by the immune system [5]. This means that serology allows for the determination of not only current infections but also prior infections. \n\nConventional serological techniques (Table 1), such as the western blot (WB), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the backbone of clinical diagnostic and research laboratories [6]. Their applications within infectious diseases are well-established, and many clinical tests are based on these three techniques. However, key limitations of these techniques are their low throughput and the inability for multiplexing tested pathogens. This is unlike modern high throughput, multiplexable chip-based and bead-based assays (Table 1) [7,8], although even these multiplexable assays require the expression and purification of target antigens, which may not be feasible for some pathogen proteins.",

            "text": "Characterizing the interactions between disease-specific antibodies and their cognate antigens has proven highly informative in the study of host-pathogen relationships and critical in the development of effective biomedical products. The discovery of modified antigens or autoantigens that are specifically recognized by patient antibodies is of growing importance in disease research and target development for diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. These complexes are typically found by querying immune sera against possible ligands in lysates, or in libraries of proteins or peptides made recombinantly or synthetically. Myriad of binding assays such as immunoblots [1], ELISAs [2], phage display [3], ribosome display [4], beads [5], and microarrays [6,7] have been employed to identify the antigen or epitope recognized by an antibody. Here we explore using a simple, universal system for epitope identification. \n\nIn its original description, phage display was used to survey a library of peptides for binding to a given antibody [8]. It has now been used extensively to display libraries of peptides or antibody fragments, expressed as coat protein fusions on the phages surface, for \"panning\" against a particular molecule of interest. Phages are washed across an isolated, immobilized target; bound recombinant phage are collected and amplified in bacteria for additional rounds of panning [9]. One of the major drawbacks of phage display is the technique's reliance on multiple in vivo steps that cannot be well-controlled and incur biases to the output. For example, any peptide-coat protein fusions that reduce the fitness of the phage or reduce secretion to the phage surface will not be well represented if at all. In the initial panning round each phage recombinant is present in such limited numbers that the probability of a ligand finding a target can be stochastic. Yet only those recombinants that survive this first round are subsequently propagated reiteratively. Phage approaches do not lend themselves to high throughput of samples. As an alternative, in vitro translation systems such as ribosome display have been developed for studying protein-protein interactions, including antigen/antibody binding.",

            "text": "In clinical practice, the quantification of single biomarkers is frequently not sufficient to support a confident diagnosis. Thus, multiple analyses are required for each diagnosis, many of which might rely on antibodies, the current workhorses of the diagnostic world. Although many antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for their antigen targets, they often suffer from batch-to-batch variation. ELISA assays, which are the main diagnostic platform for antibodies, have been improved with protocols that increase their efficiency and the specificity of their output. However, ELISA assays cannot be readily multiplexed to measure simultaneously the many biomarkers required for a confident diagnosis. A strength of aptamer biosensors is their ability to be multiplexed. Another strength is the range of technologies that can be applied to produce operating aptasensors [166][167][168]. With these strengths to drive it, aptasensor technology is one of the fastest growing biotechnology areas in diagnostics with an expectation of reaching about $250 million by 2020 [169,170].\n\nAptamers can provide new opportunities for medical diagnostics beyond what is available with antibodies [18,171]. For example, aptamers can be selected against non-immunogenic and toxic targets, to which antibodies cannot be elicited. These short, single-stranded oligonucleotides can be synthesized via simple chemical synthesis, making them easier and less costly to produce than antibodies [172]. When synthesized in cells containing DNAs encoding RNA aptamers, they can fold appropriately and recognize intracellular targets [173][174][175].\n\nA limited number of aptasensors are in the pipeline to be used in the areas such as biomarker and microorganism detection and cancer clinical testing. The available aptasensors include (1) OTA-Sense for detection of Ochratoxin A (OTA), a toxin produced by fungi [165,176]; (2) AflaSense for detection of aflatoxins [95,[177][178][179]; (3) AptoCyto for flow cytometry applications [165]; (4) AptoPrep as a kit including conjugated aptamers specific to CD-31, EGFR, HGFR,",

We created microarrays with only 10,000 random sequence peptides but chose a relatively long length (17 amino acids \u03e9 3 residue linker) to allow each peptide to encompass much more complexity than typical epitope peptides. The random sequences allow an unbiased display of antibody binding; the length provides many possible epitope positions per peptide and (potentially) allows for some structural complexity. The array format allows the assay to be run without the biological complications of phage display and high-speed piezo printing onto commercially produced substrate allows thousands of microarrays to be consistently produced each month. We recently demonstrated the potential utility of these arrays by immunosignaturing vaccines, infections, and Alzheimer's disease 25,26. In order to utilize this technology as a clinical diagnostic, we must first characterize the physical and chemical properties of antibody binding to these peptide microarrays.",

            "text": "With the availability of genome sequences, a variety of Yersinia isolates originally typed as Y. pseudotuberculosis have now been reclassified into other species. These bacteria now belong to a group called \"Y. pseudotuberculosis complex\" including Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. similis and Y. wautersii [7]. \n\nAfter suspected infection with Y. pestis, rapid diagnosis is required, since a fatal course of the disease can only be averted by prompt antibiotic therapy. Antigen diagnostic methods (e.g., Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay, ELISA), in which antigen detection is depending on antibodies, are very reliable [8][9][10], however, the assays are time consuming and have the disadvantage of delayed detection, since positive results can only be reliably established several days after the bacterium has multiplied considerably inside the host. Therefore, these methods are typically used for confirmation only. Currently, the detection of Y. pestis is generally founded on a combination of several methods. Culture-based identification by subsequent microscopy provides rather tentative results; more precise results are obtained by the detection of antigens (e.g., the F1 capsule antigen) and by molecular genetic identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) e.g., on virulence gene markers pla and caf constituting a diagnostic standard for the plague pathogen [11,12]. PCR can also be combined with other means of detection such as bacteriophage (phage) plaque diagnostics but such methods take considerable time [13]. The time issue can be ameliorated when recombinant, light emitting phages are constructed for assays measured in hours instead of days [14]. A clear advantage of additional rapid and specific microscopy-based detection methods would be that these could independently confirm PCR results: a combination necessary for a complete diagnostic algorithm. \n\nWe hypothesized that receptor binding proteins (RBP) of host-specific bacteriophages of Y. pestis [15,16] could close this diagnostic gap. Phages are the most numerous and versatile organisms on earth [17].",

            "text": "Specific detection and identification of protein biomarkers in clinics have been mainly accomplished by various immunological techniques based on labeling sensors, where the final result is proportional to the amount of label bound to the targeted molecule [29,30]. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely used for protein detection and quantification and is based on the use of specific binding surfaces decorated with antibodies that capture protein biomarkers from various body fluids. Protein biomarkers are then revealed by enzyme-labeled antibodies [31] that produce a fluorescent signal/color that corresponds to the amount of biomarker immobilized by the capturing antibody. ELISA displays high sensitivity-for instance, it can already detect the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is used for prostate cancer screening, at a concentration of 100 pg/mL [32]. However, the use of a single cancer protein biomarker is not sufficient for accurate cancer detection, as PSA can also be detected in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [33]. Therefore, to improve diagnostic accuracy, various multiplex immunoassays that combine the antibody-labeled detection of different protein biomarkers are needed. An example of a multiplex immunoassay is the FDA-approved OVA1 \u00ae test that combines the detection of multiple serum-derived protein cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), transferrin, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), \u03b22-microglobulin, and transthyretin with software calculations to predict ovarian malignancy [34]. In the second generation OVA2 \u00ae (Overa) test, the latter two-protein biomarkers are replaced with human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), having improved accuracy and reduced false results [35,36]. Due to their high sensitivity, immunological techniques are also used for the detection of CTC. For example, the CellSearch \u00ae system uses nanoparticles labeled with antibodies that target the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) to separate CTC from other cells present in the blood of patients with metastatic colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer.",

Optimising PCR conditions to work in a range for each thermocycling parameter is crucial to ensure that the method is robust and applicable to different users with heterogeneous laboratory settings. \n\nFrom The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics & Biomarker Discovery 2020 (MDBD2020) Kota Bharu, Malaysia. 17 -18 November 2020 Background Morbidity and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain among the highest in cancer cases due to late detection. Conventional diagnostics are complicated, often invasive and timeconsuming with variable sensitivity and specificity. Most CRC diagnostic tools are antibody-based which suffer from shortcomings including stability and batch variability issues, expensive and complicated for mass production. Hence, development a highly sensitive, specific and rapid diagnosis device using non-antibody based, such as a biosensors is needed. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Affimer protein (12.6 kDa) as a novel alternative affinity binding reagent for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection and its application in bioanalytical and biosensor assays. CEA, is the only validated blood biomarker routinely used for prognostic screening of advanced CRC. Methodology Anti-CEA Affimers were screened and isolated using phage display libraries. Characterisation of the specificity and selectivity binding of Affimers against CEA were evaluated using affinity-fluorescence staining on LoVo cells, affinity-precipitation assay and SPR analysis for the determination of kinetic binding. The optimized CEA binders were fabricated on DropSens screen printed gold electrodes coated with a novel non-conducting polymer layer, polyoctopamine (POct), for CEA detection. Electrochemical characterisation of Affimer-based biosensors was performed via cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and protein blotting.",

[41] reported the generation of several antibodies binding specifically to Crf2, an A. fumigates antigen of the glycosyl hydrolase family that is located in the cell wall of the growing hyphae. These antibodies could serve as tools for new diagnostic assays such as serum ELISA or histopathological immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies described in this study were isolated from two different phage-displayed scFv libraries: One was a macaque immune library with a theoretical diversity of 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 independent clones; while the other was human na\u00efve antibody library HAL4/7 [23]. Both libraries were used in two different panning strategies: the first was performed on recombinant antigen immobilized on immunostrips; the second was carried out in solution with biotinylated antigen. Finally, 16 individual scFv clones were selected, with six clones deriving from the na\u00efve library and ten from the immune library. Interestingly, all antibodies generated on immobilized antigen bind to linear epitopes, whereas all antibodies generated by panning in solution bind to conformational epitopes. Seven of these antibodies bound to their native antigen on growing hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and did not show crossreactions to other Aspergillus species or Candida albicans. \n\nMalaria is a life-threatening protozoal infection of the red blood cells and one of the most common mosquito-borne diseases. Currently, an estimated 3.2 billion people in tropical and subtropical countries live at risk of malaria [173,174]. In humans malaria is elicited by at least five different species of Plasmodium, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi [175]. P. falciparum is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally, while P. vivax is the most widespread parasite [176]. Three different approaches to generate antibodies against P. falciparum using phage display are described. In these studies various structures of different developmental stages of the parasite served as antigens.",

            "text": "One of the rapidly growing applications of protein microarray technology in the field of clinical proteomics is biomarker identification. This application for protein microarrays stemmed from traditional serology studies, which focus on the diagnostic identification of antibodies in patient serum samples. These antibodies can be produced as part of an immune response to an infection, against a foreign protein, or even against a person's own protein. When proteins on a protein microarray are viewed as potential antigens, researchers can use it as a platform to identify autoantibodies that show statistically significant association with an infection or with a disease of interest. In general, the following approach is used: first, patient sera are diluted (e.g. 1000-fold) and incubated on a preblocked antigen microarray (i.e. protein microarray), followed by a stringent washing step. Then, positive signals are detected using anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies coupled with various fluorophores for detection (Fig. 1). Compared with traditional serology techniques, such as ELISA, agglutination, precipitation, complementfixation, and fluorescent antibodies, protein microarray-based serum profiling is much more sensitive and can be performed at a much higher throughput. Another significant advantage is that it offers an unbiased platform for novel biomarker identification. In this section, we will review four studies to illustrate the history and development of protein microarrays in biomarker identification.",

            "text": "Antibodies are target or epitope selective and may lose their binding specificity and affinity in the occurrence of any protein modification (Wang et al., 2019). \n\nIn addition, the smaller size of aptamers makes them ideal for in vivo use compared to antibodies. The smaller size of aptamers promotes in vivo application due to the ease of membrane penetration, endocytosis, and internalization, ease of formulation into polymeric substrates, and so forth. Also, the smaller size enables easy aptamer formulation into gel and aerosol for intranasal administration or nebulization, straightforward delivery into the respiratory system, and swift neutralization kinetics (Sun, Liu, Wei, et al., 2021). Moreover, immunofluorescence dyes and drugs could be coupled onto aptamers without affecting its functionality and properties (Somasunderam et al., 2005). \n\nAptamers can be employed in biosensing devices or other technologies as probes, and such biosensors are called aptasensors. These include aptamer-chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay, aptamer-based-surface Plasmon Resonance, aptamer-based fluorescence, nanoarray aptamer chip assay, proteome microarray, and aptamer-based Raman spectroscopy (Koteswara Rao, 2021). Figure 4 shows some aptamer-based diagnostic assays or technologies for rapid, specific, and efficient detection of viral infections. These assays are superior to conventional biosensors that use antibodies as they are stable, have high affinity to targets, are adaptable, and can be developed for a wide range of targets (Mairal et al., 2007), using various transduction mechanisms. Aptasensors have been applied in different forms to detect chemicals, disease biomarkers, and pathogens found in food. Identifying and diagnosing diseases early is crucial to help patients receive initial treatment and better healthcare delivery (Wandtke et al., 2015). In light of this, several antigens and/or viruses have aptamers developed to aid in their diagnosis. Aptamers generated for this purpose target either the whole virus or surface antigens.",

A newer format for antigen-antibody detection where the detector antibody is labeled by chemiluminescence facilitates an even greater sensitivity [13]. In one approach, target antigen is first complexed to paramagnetic beads coated with capture antibody and then identified using a detector antibody. An electrochemical flow cell with photon detector is used to detect the targetantibody interactions with detection limits approaching 200 fmol/L and dynamic ranges of six orders of magnitude [10]. More recently, a novel type of biosensor for rapid pathogen identification has been described using B cells as sensing elements. This system know as CANARY (cellular analysis and notification of antigen risks and yields) utilizes B lymphocytes genetically engineered to express both cytosolic aquorin, a calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein, and membrane bound antibodies specific for a given pathogen or toxin [14]. Interactions of antigen with antibody elevate intracellular calcium levels resulting in light emission by the cytosolic aquorin molecules. The system responds in a fashion that is more rapid, sensitive, and specific than most antigen detection systems, and has been shown to detect Yersinia pestis in less than 3 min at levels of 50 colony forming units [14].",

For selectivity, this is combined with the receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) selected by in vitro evolution in the lab, and determines the strain to be killed by the synthetic phage. Multivalent phages with multiple RBPs can expand the host range, if the therapeutic phage is intended to be used on a wider range of bacteria. \n\nWith regards to aptamers, recognition and specific binding are promising aspects. The selection of aptamers from oligonucleotide pools by SELEX can allow for a wide range o+{[[/as well as in clinical samples (Qiao, Deng et al., 2018) [58]. \n\nWith respect to the assay, different formats of detection with aptamers are the enzymelinked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA), fluorescence-based assays, aptamer-based flow cytometry, fluorogenic assays, and electrochemical sensing, which are promising diagnostic tools. The next criterion in CDx, which is the biomarker development, can be accomplished by the highly multiplexed slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based biomarker discovery. The diagnostic platform SOMAscan detects and quantifies >1300 proteins simultaneously in a variety of clinical samples [177]. In one instance, SOMAscan discovered several biomarkers [178]. \n\nThe other tool is clustered repetitive interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPRassociated enzyme (CRISPR-CAS), which is used against antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Diagnostic platforms use Cas enzymes (Cas12/Cas13) incubated with the target nucleic acid and fluorescent ssDNA/ssRNA reporters. On detection of the target, the Cas enzymes transcleave and generate a robust fluorescent signal that has been correlated with PCR-based methods [179]. A different multiplexing strategy also uses Cas9 to enrich low-abundance targets from complex backgrounds before NGS.",

Among the most recent is the development of a latex bead agglutination assay using the TF of phage E094 as a bead-conjugated bioprobe for rapid detection of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis (Figure 2c). In a field evaluation using 300 patient isolates taken from different specimens (e.g. urine and blood), the assay presented a diagnostic accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 98%, and specificity of 83% (the latter being improved through assay buffer modification) [24]. An alternative approach developed by Shi et al. leveraged the different interaction mechanisms of phage TFs and the antibiotic Polymyxin B to their respective cell wall targets to produce a dual-site detection assay for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In brief, the TF of phage PaP1 TF was used as a highly specific bioprobe for bacterial immobilization before applying tracer Fluresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated Polymyxin B as a highly sensitive recognition element [45]. He et al. used the same recombinant PaP1 TF conjugated to magnetic beads to immobilize and separate P. aeruginosa from solution for downstream identification, an approach the authors demonstrated could also be combined with antimicrobial susceptibility testing [46]. The foodborne pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are notoriously hard to detect, especially with traditional culture-based methods. As such, Filik et al. used recombinant TFs from Yersinia phage \u03c6YeO3-12, to develop an ELISAbased assay specific for the pathogenic Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 [47]. For viable but nonculturable (VBNC) E. coli detection, Costa et al. combined magnetic enrichment with spectrofluorimetric approaches using the RBP of phage 285p as a bioprobe.",

            "text": "Evolutionary processes in cells have led to the development of a diverse repertoire of receptors to which biomolecules can specifically bind. Many biological functions depend on this specific binding called biorecognition, considered to be an essential process in living organisms [1]. Biological systems frequently use proteins (such as enzymes, membrane receptors, and antibodies) for biorecognition because of their chemical structure (shape complementarity with target molecules) [1,2]. \n\nAntibodies are highly specific defense molecules, mostly acknowledged to be synthesized as part of the adaptive immune response in complex organisms. In healthy individuals, antibodies play several relevant roles in maintaining homeostasis, such as recognizing exogenous agents (e.g. binding to pathogen's antigens and neutralizing them). Due to their low dissociation constant (in the order of 10 \u22127 to 10 \u221212 ) and the feasibility to produce them on a large scale, antibodies are one of the most common biorecognition elements used for diagnostic technologies and biosensors [3,4]. \n\nIn this article, the term cancer biomarker is used to describe distinctive, naturally occurring molecules found in biological samples of patients with cancer (e.g. proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acid sequences, etc.). The term cancer entity refers to supramolecular biological structures found in cancer samples (e.g. exosomes, cells, and organelles, among others). These biomarkers or entities are associated with a particular physiological or pathological process or stage in patients with cancer. On the other hand, the term biorecognition engineering refers to the synthetic development of bioreceptors through different technologies capable of interacting with cancer biomarkers and cancer entities. This capability can be used, for instance, in the construction of diverse technologies such as molecular diagnostic tools [5], therapeutic [6], and even theranostic agents [7]. Biorecognition engineering technologies can overcome some limitations or disadvantages of conventional diagnostic tools based on antibodies, making them a promising alternative. \n\nThree types of emerging biorecognition engineering technologies were analyzed in this article: molecularly imprinted polymers, recombinant antibodies, and antibody mimetic molecules.",

            "text": "Therefore, specific hypotheses regarding the nature of molecular alterations can be tested and generated, and the observed measurements can be biologically interpreted. \n\nA common application of antibody arrays in cancer research is the identification of biomarkers or molecules that are potentially valuable for diagnosis or prognosis or as surrogate markers of drug response. The multiplex capability of antibody arrays allows the efficient screening of many marker candidates to reveal associations between proteins and disease states or experimental conditions. Multiplexed measurements also allow the evaluation of the use of multiple markers in combination. The use of combinations of proteins for disease diagnostics may produce fewer false positive and false negative results as compared with tests based on single proteins. Antibody microarrays, by increasing the number of proteins that can be conveniently measured in clinical samples, could more significantly take advantage of the benefit of using combined markers in diagnostics. Other example applications of antibody microarrays in cancer research are to evaluate the coordinated changes of members of signaling pathways or to measure changes in expression levels of a class of proteins, such as angiogenesis factors. \n\nThis review covers the major applications of antibody array technologies to cancer research. The first section gives an overview of the main features of the various antibody microarray technologies. Details of the technologies will not be covered extensively; reviews with a greater technological focus are available elsewhere (2)(3)(4)(5)(6). The next two sections cover applications to cancer research and are divided according to the type of sample analyzed: fluids (second section) and cells (third section). The final section looks at some of the related but alternate experimental antibody array strategies applied to cancer research. TECHNOLOGICAL OVERVIEW Many variants on antibody microarray technology have appeared. Fig. 1 presents the main experimental formats covered in this article. Two main types of formats are \"labelbased\" assays (Fig. 1A) and \"sandwich\" assays (Fig. 1B). The methods are complementary and have respective advantages and disadvantages. In the label-based assay, the targeted proteins are labeled with a tag that allows detection after capture by an immobilized antibody.",

            "text": "In the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

            "text": "As we all know, traditional diagnostic technology of serological biomarkers needs many serum samples with low efficiency and high cost. Autoantibodies for different kinds of diseases have been observed in the serum of most patients, so biomarkers in the serum can be used to screen, diagnose, or monitor diseases. [118,119] By introducing the T7 phage display system into the detection of serological biomarkers, this new type of diagnostics can be more accurate, convenient, and efficient. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] For example, Talwar et al. isolated mRNA from leukocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of patients with nodule disease, and then extracted cDNA library of T7 phages. [23] They constructed a microarray platform, and screened serum from lung cancer patients, cystic fibrosis subjects, and healthy controls. [23] Next, 1000 Bayes models were built on the training sets from the microarray platform and the top 20 frequently significant clones were picked up. The results indicated that the cystic fibrosis specific clones were significantly correlated with the clinical value, such as body mass index (BMI), Forced Expiratory Volume 1% (FEV1%), and sweat chlorine test, at a high Pearson correlation. They demonstrated that immunological biopanning using the T7 phage display library could accurately identify cystic fibrosis-specific serological markers for the first time, which turned out to have practical values for the development of molecular therapy. [120,121] Another example is a study by Li et al. [28] To improve the efficiency of early diagnosis for lung tumor, they constructed a lung tumor protein chip based on biomarkers selected from the constructed lung cancer T7-phage cDNA library. First, the antigenantibody reaction selected T7 phages with affinity against the serum antibodies from a human with and without lung tumors. After four rounds of biopanning, they obtained 2880 bacteriophages corresponding to lung cancer diseases. Twelve bacteriophages only bound to serum antibodies of lung cancer patients were screened",

            "text": "Background Current diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB), a major global health challenge that kills nearly two million people annually, are time-consuming and inadequate. During infection a number of bacterial molecules that play a role in the infective process are released and have been proposed as biomarkers for early TB diagnosis. Antigen 85 (Ag85) is the most abundant secreted TB protein, and a potential target for this diagnostic approach. One of the bottlenecks in the direct detection of such bacterial targets is the availability of robust, sensitive, specific antibodies. Methods Using Ag85 as a model, we describe a method to select antibodies against any potential target using a novel combination of phage and yeast display that exploits the advantage of each approach. Results The efficiency of this approach was attested to by the 111 specific antibodies identified in initial screens. These were assessed for binding to the different Ag85 subunits, affinity, and activity in sandwich assays. Conclusions The novelty of this approach lies in the possibility of screening the entire output of a phage antibody selection in a single experiment by yeast display. This can be considered analogous to carrying out a million ELISAs. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified in this way show high binding affinity and selectivity for the antigens and offer an advantage over traditional mAbs produced by relatively expensive and time consuming techniques. This approach has wide applicability, and the affinity of selected antibodies can be significantly improved, if required.",

            "text": "In a world plagued by emerging pathogenic threats, there remains a great need for targeting strategies that enable accurate and sensitive diagnostics and effective therapeutics. Human monoclonal antibodies, like the ones presented herein, offer the opportunity for accurate and sensitive immunodiagnostics and/or potent imnunoantibiotics. Ideally, these antibodies have no adverse effects on human microbiota/tissue while binding their pathogenderived antigens with high specificity and high affinity. \n\nImmunoantibiotics might provide unique resilience to pathogen mutations, as they can be deployed as an oligoclonal mixture, ie, targeting different epitopes of the same antigen. Developing antibodies with these characteristics is possible using in vitro evolution of human-antibody libraries by various display technologies. This approach allows for the selection of pathogen-specific antibodies, especially when negative selection steps are included to deplete the library of antibodies interacting with human cells and/or other microorganisms. Furthermore, the use of complementary display platforms (eg, phage and yeast, as previously described 54,61 ) allows selection of reagents that tend to be relatively well expressed in comparison to traditional selection methods. This results in high-specificity human antibodies that are more likely to retain immunoreactivity outside the display context and thus rapidly developable into commercial products. Affinity of these antibodies can eventually be increased by in vitro affinity maturation, should the need arise. \n\nHere, we carefully characterized a set of previously reported antibodies obtained by in vitro selection of a phage-display library of single-chain human antibodies for binding to recombinant Y. pestis virulence factor F1. 58 Among these antibodies, we downselected \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8, based on features required for development of accurate, sensitive, and portable diagnostics, and targeted therapeutics. We further derivatized \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8 to bind radiometals for alternative antibiotic applications. Their retention of immunoreactivity as phage- 58 and yeast-displayed scFvs (Supplementary Figure S1), indicates that the functionality of \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8 is unaffected by display context.",

However, current clinical diagnostic methodologies such as PCR, sputum culture, or smear microscopy are not ideal. Antibody-based assays are a suitable alternative but require specific antibodies against a suitable biomarker. Mycolic acid, which has been found in patient sputum samples and comprises a large portion of the mycobacterial cell wall, is an ideal target. However, generating anti-lipid antibodies using traditional hybridoma methodologies is challenging and has limited the exploitation of this lipid as a diagnostic marker. We describe here the isolation and characterization of four anti-mycolic acid antibodies from a nonimmune antibody phage display library that can detect mycolic acids down to a limit of 4.5ng. All antibodies were specific for the methoxy subclass of mycolic acid with weak binding for \u03b1 mycolic acid and did not show any binding to closely related lipids or other Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) derived lipids. We also determined the clinical utility of these antibodies based on their limit of detection for mycobacteria colony forming units (CFU). In combination with an optimized alkaline hydrolysis method for rapid lipid extraction, these antibodies can detect 105 CFU of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, a close relative of Mtb and therefore represent a novel approach for the development of diagnostic assays for lipid biomarkers.",

            "text": "In this study, we expanded the use of NGS for phage display antibody discovery and analyzed complex phage pools generated through cell pannings to evaluate not primarily the most abundant clones that had largely already been discovered by direct screening but instead the low-abundant clones that had been enriched through deep mining strategies. The majority of these antibodies bound to the target cells with no binding to the non-target cells demonstrating selectivity also of low-abundant clones. NGS is thus very powerful as a deep mining strategy and allowed us to identify clones of very low frequencies. A limitation of pure NGS-based screening is currently the cost of gene synthesis and lack of direct evidence of binding specificity of identified clones. However, a reduced cost of gene synthesis in combination with the capability to synthesize thousands of genes (Kuhn et al., 2017) will likely make this approach even more useful for phage display antibody discovery in the future. \n\nOne challenge in the discovery of antibodies against low expressed cell surface receptors is the sensitivity of the assay used for detection of antibody binding. Antibodies to really low expressed receptors, such as the ones discovered through fishing in this study, would have been missed using a flow cytometry screening on primary cells alone, since the signal is close to background. The number of clones binding to targets with a low expression level on the cells increases in the deep mining strategies (Figure 4C) and is therefore most likely higher than the number of clones selected for sequencing in this study. Using a more sensitive assay (Earnshaw and Osbourn, 1999;Gusev et al., 2001), and/or more allowing criteria in the screening, probably would have resulted in identification of even more clones binding to new, currently unknown, targets. \n\nIn summary, a phage pool generated through a cell panning strategy is usually a selective, complex population of binders, many of which are beyond reach when using a discovery approach based on direct screening alone. We show that the combination of direct screening and deep mining enables discovery of clones of both high and low frequencies, which allows additional targets and epitopes to be found. Our findings have the potential to advance discovery of novel targets, pathways, and antibodies to facilitate development of new treatments for patients with various diseases.",

            "text": "inTrODUcTiOn Emerging infectious diseases cause human suffering (1,2), threaten food security (3), and contribute to the decline of vulnerable populations and species (4). As such, in the face of elevated rates of infectious disease emergence in humans (5,6), domestic animals (7) and wildlife (8)(9)(10), effective surveillance for pathogen exposure is increasingly important. \n\nSurveillance for emerging infections is challenging because it requires detection of previously unreported infectious agents, and/or diagnosis of exposure or infection in understudied animal species. Indeed, animals are hosts to hundreds of pathogens and parasites (11) with previously unidentified species regularly documented (12)(13)(14). Yet, available disease diagnostics typically target known infections that cause detectable pathology in humans or economically important domestic animals resulting in a relatively narrow range of tests that are highly pathogen specific. Common molecular techniques to detect pathogens include tests that detect genetic material of the pathogen itself and antibody-based diagnostics that detect the host's antibodies to a given pathogen. Advancing sequencing methods show promise for simultaneously detecting a wider range of pathogens (15,16) but, while genetically based techniques often have high sensitivity and specificity, they are limited to detection of active infections. Many infections last only a few days and thus may escape detection unless sampling can occur on a tight time frame. Most importantly, diagnostic techniques based on amplifying pathogen genetic material still require pathogen specific primers and/or previous publication of genetic sequences and are, thus, unsuitable in situations where the identity of pathogens is uncertain. Antibody-based techniques, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or immnuofluorescence assays, offer a way to detect infection after pathogen exposure has occurred because antibody titers to many infections can remain elevated for months to years after primary infection (17). However, antibody-based techniques typically used in disease diagnostics are highly pathogen specific, which limits their utility in detecting novel infections. \n\nAn ideal diagnostic approach for monitoring (often unknown) infections in natural populations would complement existing genetic and antibody techniques by detecting the presence of pathogens non-specifically, using immunological markers that indicate recent presence of infection.",

These sensors are devices designed to perceive and gauge alterations in the optical properties of a substance, translating them into measurable electrical signals.Common optical sensor approaches include colorimetry, fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), flow cytometry, lateral flow assays (LFA), chemiluminescence, and bioluminescence (Yan et al., 2018). There are different types of optical sensors and nanomaterials used for the detection of plant diseases (Table 1) M13 bacteriophages were modified to exhibit a receptor-binding protein naturally inclined towards bacteria. These phages were able to attach to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), amplifying signals and causing a visible change in color. A colorbased sensor was utilized to identify pathogens, while UV-visible spectroscopy was employed for precise measurement. This method achieved a detection limit of 10 2 CFU mL \u22121 , with a linear detection range spanning from 10 2 to 10 6 CFU mL \u22121 . The primary optical techniques for detecting plant pathogen DNA typically involve color-based tests utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), such as lateral flow assays and aggregation assays. Furthermore, fluorescent and color-based microarrays, along with electrochemiluminescence analysis, are frequently employed for this objective. Leveraging lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) has presented exciting prospects for enhancing signals, including the integration of nanomaterials like nanoparticles and graphene, alongside straightforward adjustments to the platform structure, such as adopting a vertical flow configuration (Parolo et al., 2013a;Parolo et al., 2013b;Rivas et al., 2014;Morales-Narv\u00e1ez et al., 2015;Nunes-Pauli et al., 2015).",

            "text": "To be widely used in the clinical setting, the detection system should be easy to use and can be performed by untrained staff with little laboratory and experimental experience. Moreover, when the volume of the clinical samples is limited and an increasing number of pathogens per sample needs to be tested, the detecting system should be high-throughput to allow detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously [6,20,21]. Multiple detection, easy to use, and affordability are requirements for detection methods in the clinical setting. Thus, an ELISA-array, which combines the advantages of ELISA and protein array, meets the above requirements. \n\nIt has been reported that an ELISA-array has been used in the diagnosis of cancer and auto-allergic disease [7,12]; however, No study has reported the detection of viral pathogens. In this study, we developed a multiplex ELISA-based method in a double-antibody sandwich format for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis-associated viral pathogens. \n\nThe production of a reliable antibody chip for identification of microorganisms requires careful screening of capture of antibodies [14]. Cross-reactivity must be minimized and the affinity of the antibody is as important as the specificity. First, we prepared and screened 23 monoclonal antibodies against eight viruses and verified the specificity and affinity to the target viruses by an immunofluorescence assay. Then, the antibodies were screened by an ELISA-array with a double-antibody sandwich ELISA format. The antibodies which produced cross-reactivity and low-positive signals were excluded. Finally, six antibodies were selected as capture antibodies. Another monoclonal antibody, 2A10, which could specifically react with all viruses in the genus Flavivirus was used for detecting antibody against DV, JEV, and TBEV. For the detection of EEEV and SV, although the detecting and trapping antibodies were the same (1F1 and 4E11, respectively), the antibodies produced excellent positive signals. The epitope was not defined; however, we suspect that the antibodies both target the surface of the virions. As one virion exits as, many with the same epitope appear, thus no interference occurred using the same antibody in the double-antibody sandwich format assay.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT: Dengue virus (DENV) is a type of flavivirus transmitted globally by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and is the causal agent of Dengue fever. Due to global warming and rising temperatures worldwide, the rate of exposure to DENV is now reaching unprecedented levels, with over 400 million people getting infected each year. Despite worldwide attention to DENV, there is not currently an effective treatment or vaccine. Here, we focused on developing an antibody for the NS1 protein of the DENV, which enables earlier detection of disease and could further decrease the rate of death. Our study utilized a method more time-saving and cost-effective than the traditional method of extracting antibodies from the blood or B-cells of infected animals that show immunity: Phage Display. This technique allowed us to derive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the genome library and select DENV antibodies that bind to antigen proteins. In this study, we used Phage Display to select ninety-six potential antibodies from three phases of panning, which then went through indirect ELISA screening for optical density (OD) confirmation (OD > 1.5). Sixteen of the high optical density antibodies were sent to a DNA sequencing analysis facility where fifteen of them were revealed to be the same 1G1 strain. By understanding how antibodies are discovered using phage display technology, we hope to advance the field with reevaluation of current vaccines and the development of novel ones. gathered by well-known organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their statistics reveal a dramatic increase in the incidence rate of Dengue in recent decades with over 400 million infections, 100 million people showing symptoms, and 22,000 deaths each year [2]. While 22,000 deaths alone are not a statistic to be ignored, we must also watch out for the symptoms of Dengue fever. Most people who are infected by DENV recover within 2 -7 days, accompanied by mild symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and rash. However, severe dengue can result in severe internal bleeding and organ impairment [2].\n\nIn order to prevent such symptoms and casualties, it is imperative to diagnose the disease quickly and precisely. Currently, most diagnoses is based on reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), a technique that enables the identification of",

            "text": "Genetically modified PBPDBs offer effective recognition and capture of their targets. They can be efficiently used on biosensor surfaces, i.e., phages with biotinylated capsids can be immobilized on streptavidin-coated surfaces [45]. The fusing of glutathione S transferase (GST) with RBP named Gp48 of Campylobacter phage NCTC 12673 showed increased bacterial detection on SPR biosensor reflected by a low detection limit of 10 2 colony-forming units (CFU/mL) [46]. Genetic modifications of phages can increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase enzymes released while infecting the bacteria, thus increasing the detection sensitivity [47]. The lost activity or function of phage can be restored using genetic engineering [45]. The endorhamnosidase activity of tail spike protein has been reported to be restored using genetic engineering, showing good capture efficiency for Salmonella cells (10 3 CFU/mL) on a gold surface. However, the coated surface did not detect Escherichia coli, which was used as a control pathogen [9]. The specific reporter genes can be inserted into phages whose expression upon infection of a target cell allows the detection of its product [45]. \n\nThe use of phage particles, including tail proteins, tail fibers, and receptor binding proteins (RBPs), in biosensors has immense diagnostic potential as the detection technique is truly highly selective, sensitive, and rapid for detecting bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1) [3]. In 1960, Watson pioneered using phage coat proteins for the detection of bacteria by employing fluorescently labeled antibodies [48]. These phage proteins [5] Nanofibers, and nanoparticles [6] All the substrates are positively charged to allow the phage to bind on its surface through its capsid part. [42] Substrates with positive charges enhance phage attachment [16,53] The chemical functionalization of the substrates increases the phage depositing density [53,14] A single phage-based assay, conjugated with QDs of varying sizes can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously [51].",

As an example of electrochemical readout, Zeng et al. used antibody labeled gold NPs as the electrode coupled to a smartphone for electrochemical readout to sense nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-COV2. 24 Finally, lateral flow assays (LFA) employing gold nanoparticles are frequently used for detecting antibodies or antigens and provide a visual readout. Additionally, LFAs can be used to detect nucleic acids using biotinylated oligonucleotides. 25 Recent advances in biosensing systems have led to the development of novel gold nanoparticle biosensors based on colorimetric changes in solution. \u221228 Typically, these assays rely on oligonucleotidefunctionalized gold nanoparticles that can be used to detect a wide range of microorganisms. 29 Moreover, they offer a userfriendly and rapid detection platform, demonstrating promising potential for widespread applications. 29 However, to date, these biosensors have been limited to detecting a single pathogen/analyte. \n\nThe capacity to concurrently detect multiple pathogens in a single reaction (MULTIPLEXING) is becoming increasingly prevalent in diagnostic technologies.

            "text": "There are numerous molecular methods available for the molecular analysis and diagnosis of pathogens. Two key technologies in widespread use target nucleic acids using PCR-based methods and proteins using a range of antibody-based techniques. Both approaches have their distinct advantages and disadvantages: PCR assays are easier to develop, are generally more sensitive, but detection of DNA does not prove the presence of a viable, infectious pathogen and that of RNA provides no information about protein functionality. Antibody-based tests can give a result in less than five minutes (e.g. a lateral flow device) and have a low target purity requirement, but can be difficult to develop and the quality of the test depends on the quality of the antibody.\n\nImmuno-PCR [16] and real-time immuno-qPCR (iqPCR) [17] represent the first attempts to combine the advantages of the two approaches whilst overcoming the limitations associated with traditional immunoassays. However, the sensitivity and specificity of iqPCR assays as originally developed are antibody-dependent and do not necessarily exceed that of the conventional ELISA because both are reduced by nonspecific background signals [18] probably caused by cross-reactive binding of the single antibody to nontarget proteins [19]. Nonetheless, appropriately designed sandwich formats can improve the sensitivity of iPCR to make them 1000 -fold or more sensitive than ELISAs [20]. However, the most limiting aspect of iPCR are (i) that its workflow involves a multi-step process that results in significant hands-on time requirements and introduces the potential for contamination and (ii) that there is an enhanced consumption of reagents [21].\n\nIn contrast, PLA is a homogeneous assay that uses two interacting proximity probes to generate a signal and has significant potential to improve the sensitivity of detection [1]. Indeed, PLA has been used for a wide variety of applications that range from detection of proteins in single cells [22], cancer biomarkers [23] and prions [24] to proposals for its use with personalised medicine [25]. However, apart from a report detailing the proof of principle for the detection of bacteria, [4], there is only one other report of its use to detect pathogenic Escherichia coli [5].\n\nThe emergence",

Sample6 recently launched its DETECT/L kit on the back of luciferase-based recombinant phage technologies. 93 The kit correctly identifies 50 Listeria species, as well as correctly excluding 30 non-listeria species that were subjected to testing. However, converting luciferase-based assays to more optimal multiplex assays (i.e. assays that detect more than one bacterial species in a given sample) may not be straightforward, 95 which is an issue that could be circumvented by fluorescent-based reporter systems with compatible emission and excitation wavelengths. 96 he precision of phage host recognition has been explored for pathogen detection from environmental samples. Water quality control is one of the major concerns for public health as well as marine environment, and rapid methods need to be developed to allow accurate pathogen identification. One such method used a phage-based fluorescent biosensor 'phagosensor' prototype for enteric bacteria detection. 97 In this system, the synthesis of the fluorescent protein only occurs after it is delivered to E. coli TD2158 by temperate bacteriophage HK620 carrying the fluorescent gene. 98 The recombinant phages were incubated with the sample for one hour, followed by flow cytometry, which allowed sensitive detection of environmental E. coli TD2158 strain in diluted samples, and in mixed co-cultures.

Diagnosing diseases is one of the major areas in the medical field, which should be improved further for easier identification of diseases and treatments. On the other hand, epidemic diseases such as influenza and dengue must be detected during the beginning stages to avoid spreading [1][2][3]. There are different diagnostics which have been demonstrated capable of genuine detection via a wide range of biomarkers [4,5]. Among the previously generated diagnosis systems, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely considered as the \"gold standard\" to identify the major viral and bacterial diseases and molecular species [6,7]. Different strategies have been developed with ELISA with appealing characteristics such as ease of use, precision, and lower detection limit. In addition, the simultaneous detection of various diseases and use to screen for the major diseases is common in practice [8][9][10]. ELISA is an immunoassay used to detect the target of interest using the appropriate antibody on polystyrene (PS) 96-well plates. The sensitivity and selectivity of the target molecules are highly dependent on various factors in ELISA, such as the binding affinity of the target and antibody, the interaction of primary and secondary antibodies, and the efficient target immobilization on the ELISA surface. In particular, immobilization of the target on the PS plate plays a crucial role in limiting the detection. Antibody or protein may physically adsorb onto the surface of PS by the interaction of hydrophobic groups with the antibody [11]. There are some possibilities, for example, involving a weak binding of the antibody (or protein) or the instability of antibody on the PS plate and the nonuniform distribution of antibody (or protein) leading to defects in the detection. It has been proven that proper orientation of antibody on the immobilized plate improves the detection by over 64fold as compared to the randomly immobilized molecules [12,13]. Finding the suitable procedure for the efficient immobilization of protein or antibody on the PS plate with uniformity is thus a crucial need.",

            "text": "Recombinant monoclonal antibodies were generated by selection of (variable) single chain fragments (scFvs) from a chicken-derived phage display immunoglobulin (Ig) gene library using a purified, natural mixture of MAs as antigen in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [29]. Three clones (numbered 12, 16, and 18) were chosen for their stability during prolonged storage and for their varying binding specificities for MA subclasses. These antibody fragments were engineered into two types of bivalent IgY (chicken Ig) formats, one a theoretically flexible CH1-4 construct (CH denotes a constant heavy Ig domain) and the other a truncated and hypothetically more rigid CH2-4 type [29,30]. This resulted in six antibody constructs, called gallibodies. The gallibodies specifically detect MA in ELISAs and are transiently produced in Human Embryonic Kidney -293 cell cultures [29]. As ideal affinity purely mimics the anti-mycolate antibody biomarkers of TB in human patients, the way in which gallibodies recognise the mycolic acid antigen was investigated. We showed that they are unable to bind whole cell mycobacteria using an immunostaining technique, but that they are well able to detect the mycolic acid antigen in crude mycobacterial extracts. \n\nHere, we provide the first piece of evidence for the competitive detection of biomarker anti-MA antibodies in serum samples from laboratory-infected guinea pigs and human patients. This method of diagnosis of TB was envisioned by Verschoor and Beukes [31] upon the development of the first iteration of the gallibodies [32]. We present a competitive LFIA, which we tentatively labelled as MALIA (mycolate antibody lateral flow immunoassay). The principle of MALIA (Figure 1) is to detect the displacement of bound gallibodies by higher-affinity TB biomarker anti-MA antibodies in patient serum from the MA test line. This would produce a reduced/absent test line signal as an indication of active TB.",

            "text": "Phage display is a molecular biology technique that allows the presentation of foreign peptides on the surface of bacteriophages. It is widely utilized for applications such as the discovery of biomarkers, the development of therapeutic antibodies, and the investigation of protein\u2013protein interactions. When employing phages in diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring assays, it is essential to couple them with a detection system capable of revealing and quantifying the interaction between the peptide displayed on the phage capsid and the target of interest. This process is often technically challenging and costly. Here, we generated a fluorescent helper phage vector displaying sfGFP in-frame to the pIII of the capsid proteins. Further, we developed an exchangeable dual-display phage system by combining our newly developed fluorescent helper phage vector with a phagemid vector harboring the engineered pVIII with a peptide-probe. By doing so, the sfGFP and a peptide-probe are displayed on the same phage particle. Notably, our dual-display approach is highly flexible as it allows for easy exchange of the displayed peptide-probe on the pVIII to gain the desired selectivity, while maintaining the sfGFP gene, which allows easy visualization and quantification of the interaction peptide-probe. We anticipate that this system will reduce time and costs compared to the current phage-based detection systems.",

            "text": "Such biomarkers can be used to detect IC, to characterize antibody/antigen patterns that can distinguish between colonization and infection, measure immune response, and identify targets for future vaccine development [36][37][38][39]. This technique involves profiling serological responses to peptides from cell surfaces. It favors the most abundant proteins and does not account for different stage and tissue-specific gene expression from cultured cells. Antigenic protein microarray technologies may overcome this limitation and have been applied to more precisely detect differences in IgG responses, profile host humoral responses during colonization and progression to candidemia, and detect antigens associated with drug resistance [36]. Recombinant complementary DNA expression libraries have been used to identify C. albicans genes expressed in host cells during active infection and identify virulence factors, and thus could be applied for identification of clinically relevant biomarkers [40]. Evolving antibody and antigen detection techniques can pave the way for the discovery of new clinically relevant biomarkers. Given the profound immunologic derangements in patients at highest risk for IFI, these techniques may be best applied in research settings, drug, and vaccine development. \n\nLateral flow assay platforms are an attractive option for rapid, affordable, diagnostic antigen testing in dipstick format. These require no technical expertise and are ideal for point of care (POC) applications, particularly in resource limited settings. Fluid (such as urine or blood) is applied to an absorbent surface and flows over a stripe of antibody-coated beads allowing for immunochromatographic antigen detection. Commercially available LFDs are already available for the detection of Candida antigens from cervical swabs [41]. LFDs have been developed to detect antibodies against C. albicans enolase for detection of invasive disease, though still needs clinical validation [42]. Dual path platform (DPP) devices (Chembio Diagnostic, Medford, NJ, USA), are enhanced immunochromatographic assays with improved sensitivity and multiplex capability. A DPP immunoassay has been developed to detect Candida from cultured cells but clinical application studies are still required [43].",

In the present study, novel recombinant monoclonal antibodies were isolated against a T. canis recombinant antigen using the same library.

            "text": "The binding specificities of circulating immunoglobulins harbor a wealth of information related to the exposure history and health status of vertebrate organisms. Unbiased techniques to extract this information provide new opportunities for linking environmental exposures to disease, and discovering antigenic determinants of complex immune-related pathologies, including autoimmunity, allergic response, and malignancy. Several complementary high-throughput platforms have been developed to address the challenges of antibody profiling. (1)(2)(3)(4) We have previously described the development of Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), which is based on T7 bacteriophage display of synthetic oligonucleotide encoded peptidome libraries. Antibody-peptide binding is quantified via highthroughput DNA sequencing of the immunoprecipitated phage libraries (5)(6)(7)(8)(9). \n\nThe PhIP-Seq method provides several key advantages over alternative approaches. First, synthetic DNA libraries can be made to cover complete or partial proteomes, including meta-genomically defined proteins and protein variants that do not exist in nature. This database-driven design feature was utilized for the construction and screening of the phage displayed human virome ('VirScan'), which was accompanied by simultaneous high resolution alanine scanning of several dominant epitopes. (9) Further, the streamlined assay protocol takes place in solution phase (versus array-based solid phase techniques), requires no specialized equipment or instrumentation, and can be easily automated on standard liquid handling robots. (6) Perhaps the most important advantages of PhIP-Seq, however, derive from the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology as the assay readout. Sequencing of phage libraries is used to quantify clonal abundance with linear behavior over a large dynamic range. Critical to scalability, sample multiplexing via DNA barcoding enables screening at a per sample cost that is roughly one hundred fold less expensive than comparable array-based techniques. \n\nSequence reads, generated by deep sequencing of phage displayed peptidome libraries, are first demultiplexed and then aligned to the reference library sequences.",

            "text": ". The subsequent fluorescent read-out gives a direct quantification of the amount of protein present in the sample, as the SOMAmer forms a 1:1 complex with its target protein. This assay highlights two key features of SOMAmers: (1) their dual ability to bind proteins and hybridize with their complementary nucleic acid strand and (2) their ability to refold after denaturing conditions [99]. Hence, the SOMAscan platform is a powerful alternative to antibody assays, which allows a high degree of multiplexing (more than 1000 proteins measured simultaneously) with a sensitivity comparable to ELISA-type assays [98]. As such, this platform is ideal for studying the proteome in health and disease. The pertinence of the SOMAscan technology is exemplified by the variety of applications describing its use and can hardly be overestimated. The SOMAscan assay has been employed for the detection of cancer [100][101][102][103][104], lung- [105,106], neurological- [107,108], renal- [92], inflammatory-and infectious disease biomarkers [109][110][111][112][113][114][115]. Other health-related problems such as cardiotoxicity [116], metabolic dysregulation [117] and aging [118] have also been investigated with the technology. Moreover, the assay can be applied for comparative biomarker studies [119] or for monitoring deviations in plasma protein constitution during pregnancy for the early detection of abnormalities in fetal development [120].\n\nIn addition to their use in the SOMAscan platform, SOMAmers have been employed in sandwich-type diagnostic assays. One documented strategy is the combination of antibodies and SOMAmers for the detection of toxin A, B and binary toxins, which are indicators of Clostridium difficile infections. Both well plate-based and membrane-based assays were tested [121]. In the former, biotinylated SOMAmers were immobilized on a streptavidin plate and used as capture agents. Addition of a primary monoclonal antibody against the toxins resulted in the formation of a sandwich complex, which was transduced",

For example, from the repertoire of B cells of patients who recovered from influenza virus infections or who received vaccination, it was possible to isolate, by Phage Display, several antibodies with the neutralization property of different influenza virus subtypes. Another example of antibody-based immunotherapy developed by Phage Display involves the identification of antibodies specific to different types of coronavirus. These studies are an example of how Phage Display enables the selection of antibodies by an in vitro process, especially for new or mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases, as it uses only pathogen-specific antigens [39,62,63]. \n\nParticularly, MAbs play an important role in antiviral immunity preventing viral replication and disease progress. Antibodies can interfere with virus infection by various mechanisms. The primary mechanism is by targeting the virus surface proteins; antibodies can inhibit virus attachment to cell surface receptors. Another main mechanism is targeting non-receptor-binding regions, such as in endosomal membrane fusion step where neutralization can occur by interfering virus conformational changes. In general, flavivirus particles tend to display on their surface continuum epitopes that induce potently neutralizing antibodies, blocking viral entry into cells [58]. \n\nFrom the understanding of the structure of each flavivirus, it was possible to determine the antibody targets most conducive to the diagnosis and protection of the disease [64]. It is important to note that flaviviruses are not static particles and viral proteins are in a constant dynamic movement, a process known as breathing, in order to transiently reveal new epitopes, and this characteristic influences the detection and neutralization capabilities of antibodies [10].",

In some instances, filamentous phages have been utilized to integrate epitope discovery and immunization functions into a single platform. \n\nPrecise determination of conformational epitopes of neutralizing antibodies represents a crucial step in the rational design of novel vaccines; the screening of random peptide libraries displayed on phages, and of gene or genome fragment phage libraries provides a powerful, cheap and quick technique for epitope mapping [10]. Phages bearing peptides that reproduce an epitope of interest can be selected from random peptide phage-display libraries, displaying more than 10 9 different peptides, utilizing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies; in some cases, the selected peptide-displaying phage can then be used as an immunogen, to induce an antibody response [11,12]. Filamentous bacteriophage M13 is most commonly used to generate combinatorial libraries. Phages selected by phage library biopanning rarely display peptides that are identical in their primary sequence to a peptide of the protein antigen of interest; the method more commonly leads to the identification of mimotope peptides. A mimotope peptide can mimic both a linear epitope and a discontinuous conformational epitope [13]; it can also mimic a non-peptidic epitope, such as a lipopolysaccharide epitope or a glycan [14,15]. Genome-fragment phage display libraries are collections of phages engineered to express short polypeptides of a pathogen's proteome. Phage libraries that contained fragments of the genome of the H5N1 strain responsible for an outbreak of human influenza in Vietnam in 2004-2005 were used to analyze the antibodies that made people recover from the infection [16]. The insert sizes, in the pIII gene, ranged between 50-200 base pairs (bp) and 200-1000 bp.",

Also the improvement of methods that require smaller amounts of cells has opened the possibility to use this approach on patient samples. Robust techniques combining an antibody library displayed on the phage surface and protein microarray allowed the identification of auto antibodies recognized by patient sera. Many Ab molecules directly or indirectly targeting angiogenesis have been identified, and one of them, ramucirumab, has been tested in 27 phase I\u2013III clinical trials in a broad array of cancers.

Serum samples were obtained from 197 different groups of patients: confirmed TB {n = 24}, clinically diagnosed TB {n = 104}, disease controls {n = 49} and healthy controls {n = 20}. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to calculate the cut off value and comparison between TB and non-TB groups were done by the chi-square test.ResultsThe indirect ELISA method, using an mAb against Ag 85 complex, yielded 82% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 93%) and 86% specificity (95% CI, 57 to 98%) for the diagnosis of TB. The serum positivities for Ag 85 complex in cases of confirmed and clinically diagnosed TB patients were 96% (23/24) and 79% (82/104) respectively, while the positivity for patients in the non-tuberculosis group was 14% (10/69).ConclusionThe detection of Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients by indirect ELISA using mAb against purified Ag 85 complex gives a reliable diagnosis and can be used to develop an immunodiagnostic assay with increased sensitivity and specificity."

Herein, we report the development of a dipstick using a AuNP-labeled single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody for the detection of morphine. The scFv antibodies for morphine were developed using phage display-based antibody library. Immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH)- and light (VL)-chain genes were connected via a glycine\u2013serine linker isolated from murine immune repertoire and cloned into the expression vector pIT2. The scFv was produced in Escherichia coli HB2151, yielding a functional protein with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. The morphine scFv was labeled with gold nanoparticles and used as an optical immunoprobe in a dipstick. The competitive dipstick assay characterized the ability of the scFv antibody to recognize free morphine. The detection range was 1\u20131000 ng mL\u22121 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 ng mL\u22121 under optimal conditions, and the IC50 value was 14 ng mL\u22121 for morphine.

Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability.",

However, the development of an essential antibody pair capable of sandwich-type recognition of the analytes' small generic core structure is a demanding task due to limited space available for simultaneous binding of two different antibodies. We report here a generic noncompetitive assay for cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) and nodularins (Nod), a group of structurally related small cyclic peptides (\u223c1000 Da) with more than 100 naturally occurring analogs. The assay is based on the unique combination of a generic anti-immunocomplex (anti-IC) single-chain fragment of antibody variable domain (scFv) and a monoclonal antibody capable of binding to an Adda-group (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4(E),6(E)-dienoic acid) present in all MCs/Nod. The anti-IC scFv was isolated from a large synthetic antibody library with phage display and used to develop a single-step sandwich-type noncompetitive immunocomplex assay. The sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometry-based assay is capable of detecting all the 11 tested commonly occurring hepatotoxins (MC-LR, -dmlR, -RR, -dmRR, -LA, -LY, -LF, -LW, -YR, -WR, and Nod-R) at concentration below 0.1 \u03bcg/L in a 1 h assay. Using MC-LR, the most studied toxic and widely distributed of the toxins, the calculated detection limits (based on blank + 3SD response) are \u223c0.026 \u03bcg/L in 1 h and \u223c0.1 \u03bcg/L in 10 min assay time. This is by far the fastest reported immunoassay for MCs and Nod with a detection limit far below the World Health Organization's guideline limit (1 \u03bcg/L of MC-LR equivalent in drinking water). The assay was validated with spiked tap and lake water as well as with environmental surface water samples. The developed assay provides a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive tool for the quantitative detection of MCs/Nod with the additional benefit of automation and high-throughput possibilities for large scale screening of drinking and environmental surface water samples. Furthermore, the study describes the first demonstration of the assay intended for the detection of an analyte group comprising similar low-molecular weight compounds exhibiting the benefits of a reagent excess type assay.",

Unfortunately, their large size, unstable behavior, and random immobilization properties create numerous problems. The single-domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (termed VHH) offers special advantages in terms of size, stability, and ease of generating different antibody constructs. In this study, we show the potential of those VHHs in sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) by SPR technology. Different VHH constructs were immobilized onto commercial and custom-built sensor surfaces by metal chelation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, or covalent coupling. The detection of subnanogram per milliliter hPSA concentrations could be attained on a covalently coupled three-dimensional dextran surface. Moreover, the ratio of different hPSA isoform concentrations could be assessed via a sandwich assay and resulted in the detection of clinically significant antigen concentrations within 15 min. In addition, for the first time, the intrinsic protein stability is presented as an important probe design factor, since our results reveal that higher intrinsic stability offers higher resistance to harsh regeneration conditions. In conclusion, we present VHHs as a novel class of biosensor probes rivaling conventional antibodies and their derived antibody fragments."

The libraries were initially panned against a radiation-inactivated EBO virus-infected Vero cell lysate, but only weak binders were identified. In contrast, panning against secreted EBO glycoprotein (SGP) resulted in Fabs showing very strong reactivity with SGP in ELISA. These Fabs also reacted with a virion membrane preparation. The Fabs were strongly positive in IFAs with cells infected with EBO (subtype Zaire) virus but negative with uninfected cells, with a characteristic punctate staining pattern in the cytoplasm. The Fabs showed weak or no reactivity with the virus cell lysate although donor serum did react. The Fabs are now being characterized in structural and functional terms.

Successful control of the global SARS epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread, as well as, the development of vaccines and new antiviral compounds including neutralizing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease.MethodsThe human synthetic single-chain fragment variable (scFv) ETH-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scFvs against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV using a bio panning-based strategy. The selected scFvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for SARS-CoV N protein detection in ELISA, western blotting and immunocytochemistry.ResultsHuman scFv antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV can be easily isolated by selecting the ETH-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen. These in vitro selected human scFvs specifically recognize in ELISA and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in N protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations SARS-CoV particles in infected Vero cells.ConclusionThe human scFv antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful reagents for rapid detection of N SARS-CoV protein and SARS virus particles in infected target cells.",

The microneutralizing test showed that one clone, designated M1A, had neutralizing activity on Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the light- and heavy-chain genes of M1A Fab belong to the \u03ba2a and 4f families, respectively. A neutralizing test on purified M1A demonstrated that 0.5 mg/ml of M1A completely inhibited SARS-CoV activity, with an absence of cytopathic effect for 7 days. Real-time fluorescence reverse transcription-PCR also proved the neutralizing capacity of M1A. These data showed that the number of virus copies was significantly reduced in the M1A-treated group, suggesting an important role for M1A in passive immunoprophylaxis against the SARS virus."

The tight junction protein claudin 1 (CLDN-1) is essential for HCV cell entry and spread, and anti-CLDN-1 rat and mouse mAbs are safe and effective in preventing and treating HCV infection in a human liver chimeric mouse model. To accelerate translation of these observations into a novel approach to treat HCV infection and disease in humans, we screened a phage display library of human single-chain antibody fragments by using a panel of CLDN-1-positive and -negative cell lines and identified phage specifically binding to CLDN-1. The 12 clones showing the highest levels of binding were converted into human IgG4. Some of these mAbs displayed low-nanomolar affinity, and inhibited infection of human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells by different HCV isolates in a dose-dependent manner. Cross-competition experiments identified six inhibitory mAbs that recognized distinct epitopes. Combination of the human anti-SRB1 mAb C-1671 with these anti-CLDN-1 mAbs could either increase or reduce inhibition of cell culture-derived HCV infection in vitro. These novel human anti-CLDN-1 mAbs are potentially useful to develop a new strategy for anti-HCV therapy and lend support to the combined use of antibodies targeting the HCV receptors CLDN-1 and SRB1, but indicate that care must be taken in selecting the proper combination.",

This work aims at providing a novel approach for the generation of several novel human immunomodulatory antibodies capable of binding their targets in their native conformation and useful for therapeutic applications. We performed a massive parallel screening of phage libraries by using for the first time activated human lymphocytes to generate large collections of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against 10 different immune checkpoints: LAG-3, PD-L1, PD-1, TIM3, BTLA, TIGIT, OX40, 4-1BB, CD27 and ICOS. By next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis we ranked individual scFvs in each collection and identified those with the highest level of enrichment. As a proof of concept of the quality/potency of the binders identified by this approach, human IgGs from three of these collections (i.e., PD-1, PD-L1 and LAG-3) were generated and shown to have comparable or better binding affinity and biological activity than the clinically validated anti-PD-1 mAb nivolumab.

Infections are a complex mechanism of interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their host. Identification of the causative agent of the infection is vital for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Etiological laboratory diagnostic tests are therefore essential to identify pathogens. However, due to its rapidity and automation, the serological diagnostic test is among the methods of great significance for the diagnosis of infections with the basis of detecting antigens or antibodies in body fluids clinically. Epitopes, as a special chemical group that determines the specificity of antigens and the basic unit of inducing immune responses, play an important role in the study of immune responses. Identifying the epitopes of a pathogen may contribute to the development of a vaccine to prevent disease, the diagnosis of the corresponding disease, and the determination of different stages of the disease. Moreover, both the preparation of neutralizing antibodies based on useful epitopes and the assembly of several associated epitopes can be used in the treatment of disease. Epitopes can be divided into B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes; B cell epitopes stimulate the body to produce antibodies and are therefore commonly used as targets for the design of serological diagnostic experiments. Meanwhile, epitopes can fall into two possible categories: linear and conformational. This article reviews the role of B cell epitopes in the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases."

To obtain an effective tool to prevent and diagnose viral infections, we attempted to obtain human antibody fragments that can effectively neutralize viral infection and be utilized for rapid virus detection. To this end, several human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by bio-panning a phage-displayed human antibody library, Tomlinson I. The selected clones were demonstrated to bind to the S1 domain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, clone A7 in Fab and IgG formats were found to effectively neutralize the binding of S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the low nM range.

This study aimed to identify and characterize novel peptides specific for the colorectal cancer cell line RKO using a phage-displayed peptide library. After four rounds of selection plus a negative step with normal colorectal cells, CCD-841-CoN, there was an obvious phage enrichment that specifically bound to RKO cells. Cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the most specific peptides leading to the selection of the peptide sequence CPKSNNGVC. Through fluorescence microscopy and cytometry, the synthetic peptide RKOpep was shown to specifically bind to RKO cells, as well as to other human colorectal cancer cells including Caco-2, HCT 116 and HCT-15, but not to the normal non-cancer cells. Moreover, it was shown that RKOpep specifically targeted human colorectal cancer cell tissues. A bioinformatics analysis suggested that the RKOpep targets the monocarboxylate transporter 1, which has been implicated in colorectal cancer progression and prognosis, proven through gene knockdown approaches and shown by immunocytochemistry co-localization studies.

The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of \u2018Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\u2019 (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers.

The method provides specific detection of as few as 10 bacterial cells per milliliter in experimental samples, with an approximately 100-fold amplification of the signal over background in 1 h. We believe that the method can be applied to any bacteria susceptible to specific phages and would be particularly useful for detection of bacterial strains that are slow growing, e.g., Mycobacterium, or are highly infectious, e.g., Bacillus anthracis.

During infection a number of bacterial molecules that play a role in the infective process are released and have been proposed as biomarkers for early TB diagnosis. Antigen 85 (Ag85) is the most abundant secreted TB protein, and a potential target for this diagnostic approach. One of the bottlenecks in the direct detection of such bacterial targets is the availability of robust, sensitive, specific antibodies. Methods Using Ag85 as a model, we describe a method to select antibodies against any potential target using a novel combination of phage and yeast display that exploits the advantage of each approach. Results The efficiency of this approach was attested to by the 111 specific antibodies identified in initial screens. These were assessed for binding to the different Ag85 subunits, affinity, and activity in sandwich assays. Conclusions The novelty of this approach lies in the possibility of screening the entire output of a phage antibody selection in a single experiment by yeast display. This can be considered analogous to carrying out a million ELISAs. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified in this way show high binding affinity and selectivity for the antigens and offer an advantage over traditional mAbs produced by relatively expensive and time consuming techniques. This approach has wide applicability, and the affinity of selected antibodies can be significantly improved, if required.",

Produced as scFv-Fc in mammalian cells, these antibodies were further characterized and analysed for specificity and applicability in different tuberculosis antigen detection assays. Sandwich detection of recombinant 85 B was successful in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), lateral flow immunoassay and immunoblot. Whereas detection of M. tuberculosis cell extracts and culture filtrates was only possible in direct ELISA and immunoblot assays.

The identification of novel immunogenic proteins would be useful to develop ELISA based diagnostic assays with a higher specificity.ResultsA phage display library of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium genome was constructed and 47 immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using a pool of convalescent sera from pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium.

While the 2.8/2.4-linked trisaccharide contains a family-specific epitope, the branched Kdo oligosaccharide occurs only in Chlamydophila psittaci and antibodies against it will be useful in human and veterinarian diagnostics. To overcome the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that bind with high affinity to a dominant epitope formed by 2.4/2.4-linked Kdo, we immunized mice with a synthetic 2.4[2.8]-linked branched Kdo trisaccharide and used phage display of scFv to isolate recombinant antibody fragments (NH2240-31 and SAG506-01) that recognize the branched Kdo oligosaccharide with a K(D) of less than 10 nM. Importantly, although these antibodies used germline genes coding for an inherited Kdo recognition site, they were able clearly to distinguish between 2.4[2.8]2.4- and 2.4/2.4-linked Kdo. Sequence determination, binding data, and X-ray structural analysis revealed the basis for the improved discrimination between similar Kdo ligands and indicated that the alteration of a stacking interaction from a phenylalanine residue in the center of the combining site to a tyrosine residue facing away from the center favors recognition of branched 2.4[2.8]2.4-linked Kdo residues.

F1 is encoded by the caf1 gene located on the large 100-kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. Methods Phage antibody panning was performed against F1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F1-binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. Results Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F1 and a panel of F1-positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs were found to be difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F1-negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. Conclusions Our high throughput methods of selection and screening allowed for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F1 antigen. We describe implementation of different methods for phage-based immunoassay.

Here we introduce a new strategy termed phage display mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR). Instead of utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chemically bond DNA that required in the conventional IPCR, a recombinant phage particle is applied as a ready reagent for IPCR experiment. The surface displayed single chain variable fragment (scFv) and phage DNA themselves can directly serve as detection antibody and PCR template, respectively. The aim of the design is to overcome shortcoming of low detection sensitivity of scFv so as to largely facilitate the real application of scFv in immunoassay. The idea has been demonstrated by applying hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and prion protein (PrP) as detection targets in three experimental protocols (indirect, sandwich and real-time PD-IPCR assays). The detection sensitivity was increased 1000- to 10 000-folds compared with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). This proof-of-concept study may serve as a new model to develop an easy to operate, low cost and ultrasensitive immunoassay method for broad applications.",

Methods We tested 272 serum samples from patients with dengue disease. Of these, 222 were from patients with acute infection of one of the four dengue serotypes, detected by RT-PCR and/or virus isolation. Forty-eight acute-phase serum samples from patients not infected with dengue virus were also included. Results The sensitivity of the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag test on acute serum samples (n\u200a=\u200a222) was 87.4% (95% confidence interval: 82.3% to 91.5%); that of Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP was 81.5% (95% CI: 75.8% to 86.4%) after 15 minutes and 82.4% (95% CI: 76.8% to 87.2%) after 30 minutes. Both tests had a specificity of 100% (97.5% CI, one-sided test: 92.6% to 100.0%). The pan-E Dengue Early ELISA had a sensitivity of 60.4% (95% CI: 53.4% to 66.8%) and a specificity of 97.9% (95% CI: 88.9% to 99.9%). Conclusion Our findings support the use of diagnostic tools based on the NS1 antigen detection for the diagnosis of acute DENV infection. The immunochromatographic test, Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP\u2014the first rapid diagnostic test for DENV infection\u2014was highly sensitive and specific, and would therefore be a suitable first-line test in the field. The pan-E Dengue Early ELISA was less sensitive than the Platelia test; this two-step ELISA should be combined with DENV IgM antibody detection for the diagnosis of DENV infection.",

We have established two Fab clones, Fab-aVCA1 and Fab-aVCA21, which specifically recognize EBV-VCA by ELISA and WB. Inhibition ELISA competition showed that both clones could significantly reduce the binding of specific anti-EBV-VCA mAb to its relevant proteins. Furthermore, these two Fab clones could localize VCA protein in the EBV-positive P3HR1 and Daudi cell lines, as well as in tissue samples from patients with EBV-infected lymphoid malignancies.

Several species of this family are also pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential agents of biological warfare and terrorism. The objective of this work was the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or an natural outbreak of VEEV.ResultsIn this work, human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human na\u00efve antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. In total eleven different scFvs were identified and their immunological specificity was assessed. The specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93 and 230 by the selected antibody fragments was proved. Active as well as formalin inactivated virus particles were recognized by the selected antibody fragments which could be also used for Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins and immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells. The anti-VEEV scFv phage clones did not show any cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) antigenic complex, nor did they react with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), if they were used as detection reagent.ConclusionFor the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human na\u00efve scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. The broad and sensitive applicability of scFv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of Alphavirus species was demonstrated. The selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack or a natural outbreak."

Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring (Petrenko, 2008)21,(Petrenko et al., 2000)(Petrenko et al., 2004)(Petrenko et al., 2003)...Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58](Brigati et al., 2008). In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected (Brigati et al., 2004). To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation (Sorokulova et al., 2005).",

Current monitoring systems rely on antibody-derived probes, which are not hardy enough to withstand long-term use under extreme conditions. We describe new, phage-derived probes that can be used as robust substitutes for antibodies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom a landscape phage library with random octapeptides displayed on all copies of the major phage coat protein of the phage fd-tet, we selected clones that bound to spores of B. anthracis (Sterne strain). ELISA, micropanning, and coprecipitation assays were used to evaluate the specificity and selectivity with which these phage bound to B. anthracis spores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPeptides on the selected clones directed binding of the phage to B. anthracis spores. Most clones exhibited little or no binding to spores of distantly related Bacillus species, but some binding was observed with spores of closely related species. Our most specific spore-binding phage displayed a peptide EPRLSPHS (several thousand peptides per phage) and bound 3.5- to 70-fold better to spores of B. anthracis Sterne than to spores of other Bacillus species.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe selected phage probes bound preferentially to B. anthracis Sterne spores compared with other Bacillus species. These phage could possibly be further developed into highly specific and robust probes suitable for long-term use in continuous monitoring devices and biosorbents.",

Unlike conventional constructs, however, each virion displays thousands of copies of the peptide in a repeating pattern, subtending a major fraction of the viral surface. The phage body serves as an interacting scaffold to constrain the peptide into a particular conformation, creating a defined organic surface structure ('landscape') that varies from one phage clone to the next. By testing landscape libraries with three representative antigens (streptavidin from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii, avidin from chicken egg white and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli) we have shown that landscape phages may be used as a new type of substitute antibodies-filaments that can bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity. In many ways these substitute antibodies are more convenient than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts."

The libraries were initially panned against a radiation-inactivated EBO virus-infected Vero cell lysate, but only weak binders were identified. In contrast, panning against secreted EBO glycoprotein (SGP) resulted in Fabs showing very strong reactivity with SGP in ELISA. These Fabs also reacted with a virion membrane preparation. The Fabs were strongly positive in IFAs with cells infected with EBO (subtype Zaire) virus but negative with uninfected cells, with a characteristic punctate staining pattern in the cytoplasm. The Fabs showed weak or no reactivity with the virus cell lysate although donor serum did react. The Fabs are now being characterized in structural and functional terms. Major interest will focus on the ability of antibodies to neutralize EBO virus and, later, to protect animals against infection."

Successful control of the global SARS epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread, as well as, the development of vaccines and new antiviral compounds including neutralizing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease.MethodsThe human synthetic single-chain fragment variable (scFv) ETH-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scFvs against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV using a bio panning-based strategy. The selected scFvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for SARS-CoV N protein detection in ELISA, western blotting and immunocytochemistry.ResultsHuman scFv antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV can be easily isolated by selecting the ETH-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen. These in vitro selected human scFvs specifically recognize in ELISA and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in N protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations SARS-CoV particles in infected Vero cells.ConclusionThe human scFv antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful reagents for rapid detection of N SARS-CoV protein and SARS virus particles in infected target cells."

                            "ABSTRACT Human recombinant Fab fragments specific for the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were screened from a human Fab library, which was generated from RNAs from peripheral lymphocytes of convalescent SARS patients. Among 50 randomly picked clones, 12 Fabs specially reacted with S protein by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The microneutralizing test showed that one clone, designated M1A, had neutralizing activity on Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the light- and heavy-chain genes of M1A Fab belong to the \u03ba2a and 4f families, respectively. A neutralizing test on purified M1A demonstrated that 0.5 mg/ml of M1A completely inhibited SARS-CoV activity, with an absence of cytopathic effect for 7 days. Real-time fluorescence reverse transcription-PCR also proved the neutralizing capacity of M1A. These data showed that the number of virus copies was significantly reduced in the M1A-treated group, suggesting an important role for M1A in passive immunoprophylaxis against the SARS virus."

A reliable and rapid diagnostic test, which could be performed in any standard pathology laboratory, would help to obtain definitive early diagnoses of TB. In the present study we describe a prospective evaluation for demonstrating Antigen (Ag) 85 complex in the sera from TB patients.MethodsIndirect ELISA, employing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the purified Ag 85 complex, was used to demonstrate Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients. Serum samples were obtained from 197 different groups of patients: confirmed TB {n = 24}, clinically diagnosed TB {n = 104}, disease controls {n = 49} and healthy controls {n = 20}. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to calculate the cut off value and comparison between TB and non-TB groups were done by the chi-square test.ResultsThe indirect ELISA method, using an mAb against Ag 85 complex, yielded 82% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 93%) and 86% specificity (95% CI, 57 to 98%) for the diagnosis of TB. The serum positivities for Ag 85 complex in cases of confirmed and clinically diagnosed TB patients were 96% (23/24) and 79% (82/104) respectively, while the positivity for patients in the non-tuberculosis group was 14% (10/69).ConclusionThe detection of Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients by indirect ELISA using mAb against purified Ag 85 complex gives a reliable diagnosis and can be used to develop an immunodiagnostic assay with increased sensitivity and specificity."

Two Kdo trisaccharides, 2.8/2.4- and 2.4/2.4-linked, and a branched 2.4[2.8]2.4-linked Kdo tetrasaccharide occur in Chlamydiaceae. While the 2.8/2.4-linked trisaccharide contains a family-specific epitope, the branched Kdo oligosaccharide occurs only in Chlamydophila psittaci and antibodies against it will be useful in human and veterinarian diagnostics. To overcome the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that bind with high affinity to a dominant epitope formed by 2.4/2.4-linked Kdo, we immunized mice with a synthetic 2.4[2.8]-linked branched Kdo trisaccharide and used phage display of scFv to isolate recombinant antibody fragments (NH2240-31 and SAG506-01) that recognize the branched Kdo oligosaccharide with a K(D) of less than 10 nM. Importantly, although these antibodies used germline genes coding for an inherited Kdo recognition site, they were able clearly to distinguish between 2.4[2.8]2.4- and 2.4/2.4-linked Kdo. Sequence determination, binding data, and X-ray structural analysis revealed the basis for the improved discrimination between similar Kdo ligands and indicated that the alteration of a stacking interaction from a phenylalanine residue in the center of the combining site to a tyrosine residue facing away from the center favors recognition of branched 2.4[2.8]2.4-linked Kdo residues. Immunofluorescence tests of infected cell monolayers using this antibody show specific staining of C. psittaci elementary bodies that allow it to be distinguished from other pathogenic chlamydiae."

Fourteen different protein antigens were used to affinity select antibodies from this library. A panel of specific antibodies was isolated with each antigen, and each panel contained an average of 8.7 different scFv. Measurements of antibody-antigen interactions revealed several affinities below 1 nM, comparable to affinities observed during the secondary murine immune response. In particular, four different scFv recognizing the ErbB2 protein had affinities ranging from 220 pM to 4 nM. Antibodies derived from the library proved to be useful reagents for immunoassays. For example, antibodies generated to the Chlamydia trachomatis elementary bodies stained Chlamydia-infected cells, but not uninfected cells. These results demonstrate that phage antibody libraries are ideally suited for the rapid production of panels of high-affinity mAbs to a wide variety of protein antigens. Such libraries should prove especially useful for generating reagents to study the function of gene products identified by genome projects."

                            "Background Most Yersinia pestis strains are known to express a capsule-like antigen, fraction 1 (F1). F1 is encoded by the caf1 gene located on the large 100-kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. Methods Phage antibody panning was performed against F1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F1-binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. Results Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F1 and a panel of F1-positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs were found to be difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F1-negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. Conclusions Our high throughput methods of selection and screening allowed for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F1 antigen. We describe implementation of different methods for phage-based immunoassay. Based on the success of these methods and the proven stability of phage, we indicate that the use of phage-displayed, rather than phage-free proteins, might generally overcome the shortcomings of scFv antibodies."

                            "BackgroundSolely in Europoe, Salmonella Typhimurium causes more than 100,000 infections per year. Improved detection of livestock colonised with S. Typhimurium is necessary to prevent foodborne diseases. Currently, commercially available ELISA assays are based on a mixture of O-antigens (LPS) or total cell lysate of Salmonella and are hampered by cross-reaction. The identification of novel immunogenic proteins would be useful to develop ELISA based diagnostic assays with a higher specificity.ResultsA phage display library of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium genome was constructed and 47 immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using a pool of convalescent sera from pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. The corresponding complete genes of seven of the identified oligopeptids were cloned. Five of them were produced in E. coli. The immunogenic character of these antigens was validated with sera from pigs infeced with S. Tyhimurium and control sera from non-infected animals. Finally, human antibody fragments (scFv) against these five antigens were selected using antibody phage display and characterised.ConclusionIn this work, we identified novel immunogenic proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium and generated antibody fragments against these antigens completely based on phage display. Five immunogenic proteins were validated using a panel of positive and negative sera for prospective applications in diagnostics of Salmonela Typhimurium."

Characterization with regard to cross-reaction and use in routine immunoassays showed that the selected antibodies had improved characteristics when compared with the polyclonal antiserum that is currently used for brown rot diagnosis of potato in the Netherlands. The isolated monoclonal scFvs reacted in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence cell staining with all race 3 strains tested, but with only some strains belonging to other races. Furthermore, only a few cross-reactions with saprophytic bacteria, which also cross-reacted with polyclonal antisera, were observed. Using ELISA, one of the recombinant antibodies detected as few as 5 x 10(3) bacteria in potato tuber extracts. Therefore, this antibody is potentially useful for detection of R. solanacearum race 3."

                            "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring (Petrenko, 2008)21,(Petrenko et al., 2000)(Petrenko et al., 2004)(Petrenko et al., 2003)",
                            "Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58](Brigati et al., 2008). In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected (Brigati et al., 2004). To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation (Sorokulova et al., 2005)."

                            "BACKGROUND\nRecent use of Bacillus anthracis spores as a bioweapon has highlighted the need for a continuous monitoring system. Current monitoring systems rely on antibody-derived probes, which are not hardy enough to withstand long-term use under extreme conditions. We describe new, phage-derived probes that can be used as robust substitutes for antibodies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom a landscape phage library with random octapeptides displayed on all copies of the major phage coat protein of the phage fd-tet, we selected clones that bound to spores of B. anthracis (Sterne strain). ELISA, micropanning, and coprecipitation assays were used to evaluate the specificity and selectivity with which these phage bound to B. anthracis spores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPeptides on the selected clones directed binding of the phage to B. anthracis spores. Most clones exhibited little or no binding to spores of distantly related Bacillus species, but some binding was observed with spores of closely related species. Our most specific spore-binding phage displayed a peptide EPRLSPHS (several thousand peptides per phage) and bound 3.5- to 70-fold better to spores of B. anthracis Sterne than to spores of other Bacillus species.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe selected phage probes bound preferentially to B. anthracis Sterne spores compared with other Bacillus species. These phage could possibly be further developed into highly specific and robust probes suitable for long-term use in continuous monitoring devices and biosorbents."

                            "With current concerns of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biodefense, it has become important to rapidly identify infectious bacteria. Traditional technologies involving isolation and amplification of the pathogenic bacteria are time-consuming. We report a rapid and simple method that combines in vivo biotinylation of engineered host-specific bacteriophage and conjugation of the phage to streptavidin-coated quantum dots. The method provides specific detection of as few as 10 bacterial cells per milliliter in experimental samples, with an approximately 100-fold amplification of the signal over background in 1 h. We believe that the method can be applied to any bacteria susceptible to specific phages and would be particularly useful for detection of bacterial strains that are slow growing, e.g., Mycobacterium, or are highly infectious, e.g., Bacillus anthracis. The potential for simultaneous detection of different bacterial species in a single sample and applications in the study of phage biology are discussed."

                            "Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."

                            "In practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (Ghazi et al., 2016). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety."

We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of 'Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering' (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers. Such devices may soon replace the traditional time consuming ELISAs and Western blots, and deliver rapid, point-of-care diagnostics to market."

To obtain an effective tool to prevent and diagnose viral infections, we attempted to obtain human antibody fragments that can effectively neutralize viral infection and be utilized for rapid virus detection. To this end, several human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by bio-panning a phage-displayed human antibody library, Tomlinson I. The selected clones were demonstrated to bind to the S1 domain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, clone A7 in Fab and IgG formats were found to effectively neutralize the binding of S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the low nM range. In addition, this clone was successfully converted to quench-based fluorescent immunosensors (Quenchbodies) that allowed antigen detection within a few minutes, with the help of a handy fluorometer."

                            "Colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the absence of early clinical indicators. Hence, the identification of new targeting molecules is crucial for an early detection and development of targeted therapies. This study aimed to identify and characterize novel peptides specific for the colorectal cancer cell line RKO using a phage-displayed peptide library. After four rounds of selection plus a negative step with normal colorectal cells, CCD-841-CoN, there was an obvious phage enrichment that specifically bound to RKO cells. Cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the most specific peptides leading to the selection of the peptide sequence CPKSNNGVC. Through fluorescence microscopy and cytometry, the synthetic peptide RKOpep was shown to specifically bind to RKO cells, as well as to other human colorectal cancer cells including Caco-2, HCT 116 and HCT-15, but not to the normal non-cancer cells. Moreover, it was shown that RKOpep specifically targeted human colorectal cancer cell tissues. A bioinformatics analysis suggested that the RKOpep targets the monocarboxylate transporter 1, which has been implicated in colorectal cancer progression and prognosis, proven through gene knockdown approaches and shown by immunocytochemistry co-localization studies. The peptide herein identified can be a potential candidate for targeted therapies for colorectal cancer."

                            "BackgroundDiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) remains problematic despite many new advanced diagnostic methods. A reliable and rapid diagnostic test, which could be performed in any standard pathology laboratory, would help to obtain definitive early diagnoses of TB. In the present study we describe a prospective evaluation for demonstrating Antigen (Ag) 85 complex in the sera from TB patients.MethodsIndirect ELISA, employing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the purified Ag 85 complex, was used to demonstrate Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients. Serum samples were obtained from 197 different groups of patients: confirmed TB {n = 24}, clinically diagnosed TB {n = 104}, disease controls {n = 49} and healthy controls {n = 20}. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to calculate the cut off value and comparison between TB and non-TB groups were done by the chi-square test.ResultsThe indirect ELISA method, using an mAb against Ag 85 complex, yielded 82% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 93%) and 86% specificity (95% CI, 57 to 98%) for the diagnosis of TB. The serum positivities for Ag 85 complex in cases of confirmed and clinically diagnosed TB patients were 96% (23/24) and 79% (82/104) respectively, while the positivity for patients in the non-tuberculosis group was 14% (10/69).ConclusionThe detection of Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients by indirect ELISA using mAb against purified Ag 85 complex gives a reliable diagnosis and can be used to develop an immunodiagnostic assay with increased sensitivity and specificity."

Colloidal gold particles were coated with monoclonal anti-T-2 antibodies and used as detector reagent, indicating the strip test results by formation of up to two colored lines in a competitive assay format. The test line comprises a protein conjugate of the T-2 mycotoxin and the control line an antispecies-specific antibody to confirm the correct test development. To perform the test, 5 g of sample was extracted in a ratio of 1:5 with methanol/water (70:30) by shaking for 3 min and the extract directly used without further cleanup steps. The T-2 toxin lateral flow device (LFD) presented has a cutoff level around 100 microg/kg for naturally contaminated wheat and oat. The semiquantitative test may be used in the lower micrograms per kilogram range and allows for rapid semiquantitative photometric classification of the level of sample contamination. For both tests, results were obtained within 4 min. The developed LFDs therefore allow for the first time fast and on-site screening for the determination of T-2 toxin in cereals."

                            "Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based optical assays are of significant interest since the molecular phenomenon can be examined easily with change in the color of AuNPs. Herein, we report the development of a dipstick using a AuNP-labeled single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody for the detection of morphine. The scFv antibodies for morphine were developed using phage display-based antibody library. Immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH)- and light (VL)-chain genes were connected via a glycine\u2013serine linker isolated from murine immune repertoire and cloned into the expression vector pIT2. The scFv was produced in Escherichia coli HB2151, yielding a functional protein with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. The morphine scFv was labeled with gold nanoparticles and used as an optical immunoprobe in a dipstick. The competitive dipstick assay characterized the ability of the scFv antibody to recognize free morphine. The detection range was 1\u20131000 ng mL\u22121 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 ng mL\u22121 under optimal conditions, and the IC50 value was 14 ng mL\u22121 for morphine. The developed optical dipstick kit of scFv antibody was capable of specifically binding to free morphine and its analogs in a solution in less than 5 min and could be useful for on-site screening of a real sample in blood, urine, and saliva."

                            "The specificity and affinity characteristics of antibodies make them excellent probes in biosensor applications. Unfortunately, their large size, unstable behavior, and random immobilization properties create numerous problems. The single-domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (termed VHH) offers special advantages in terms of size, stability, and ease of generating different antibody constructs. In this study, we show the potential of those VHHs in sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) by SPR technology. Different VHH constructs were immobilized onto commercial and custom-built sensor surfaces by metal chelation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, or covalent coupling. The detection of subnanogram per milliliter hPSA concentrations could be attained on a covalently coupled three-dimensional dextran surface. Moreover, the ratio of different hPSA isoform concentrations could be assessed via a sandwich assay and resulted in the detection of clinically significant antigen concentrations within 15 min. In addition, for the first time, the intrinsic protein stability is presented as an important probe design factor, since our results reveal that higher intrinsic stability offers higher resistance to harsh regeneration conditions. In conclusion, we present VHHs as a novel class of biosensor probes rivaling conventional antibodies and their derived antibody fragments."

We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of 'Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering' (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers. Such devices may soon replace the traditional time consuming ELISAs and Western blots, and deliver rapid, point-of-care diagnostics to market."

The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."

                            "Immuno-PCR (IPCR) is a powerful detection technology in immunological study and clinical diagnosis due to its ultrasensitivity. Here we introduce a new strategy termed phage display mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR). Instead of utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chemically bond DNA that required in the conventional IPCR, a recombinant phage particle is applied as a ready reagent for IPCR experiment. The surface displayed single chain variable fragment (scFv) and phage DNA themselves can directly serve as detection antibody and PCR template, respectively. The aim of the design is to overcome shortcoming of low detection sensitivity of scFv so as to largely facilitate the real application of scFv in immunoassay. The idea has been demonstrated by applying hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and prion protein (PrP) as detection targets in three experimental protocols (indirect, sandwich and real-time PD-IPCR assays). The detection sensitivity was increased 1000- to 10 000-folds compared with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). This proof-of-concept study may serve as a new model to develop an easy to operate, low cost and ultrasensitive immunoassay method for broad applications."

                            "Since late 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resultant spread of COVID-19 have given rise to a worldwide health crisis that is posing great challenges to public health and clinical treatment, in addition to serving as a formidable threat to the global economy. To obtain an effective tool to prevent and diagnose viral infections, we attempted to obtain human antibody fragments that can effectively neutralize viral infection and be utilized for rapid virus detection. To this end, several human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by bio-panning a phage-displayed human antibody library, Tomlinson I. The selected clones were demonstrated to bind to the S1 domain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, clone A7 in Fab and IgG formats were found to effectively neutralize the binding of S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the low nM range. In addition, this clone was successfully converted to quench-based fluorescent immunosensors (Quenchbodies) that allowed antigen detection within a few minutes, with the help of a handy fluorometer."

                            "Serum titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) have been positively correlated with malignancies of lymphoid proliferation, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have constructed a phage display combinatorial antibody Fab library from a patient with marginal zone B cell lymphoma associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and carrying high serum anti-EBV-VCA IgG titer. Fab fragments were selected by panning against EBV-VCA protein coated onto ELISA plates, and selected Fab clones were characterized by ELISA, western blotting (WB), indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry. We have established two Fab clones, Fab-aVCA1 and Fab-aVCA21, which specifically recognize EBV-VCA by ELISA and WB. Inhibition ELISA competition showed that both clones could significantly reduce the binding of specific anti-EBV-VCA mAb to its relevant proteins. Furthermore, these two Fab clones could localize VCA protein in the EBV-positive P3HR1 and Daudi cell lines, as well as in tissue samples from patients with EBV-infected lymphoid malignancies. These results indicate that our two Fab clones are novel human mAbs specific for EBV-VCA protein and may have potential benefits for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in EBV-related lymphoid malignancies."

Point-of-care testing (POCT) has broad applications in resource-limited settings. Here, a POCT platform termed POCKET (point-of-care kit for the entire test) is demonstrated that is ultraportable and versatile for analyzing multiple types of DNA in different fields in a sample-to-answer manner. The POCKET is less than 100 g and smaller than 25 cm in length. The kit consists of an integrated chip (i-chip) and a foldable box (f-box). The i-chip integrates the sample preparation with a previously unidentified, triple signal amplification. The f-box uses a smartphone as a heater, a signal detector, and a result readout. We detected different types of DNA from clinics to environment to food to agriculture. The detection is sensitive (<103 copies/ml), specific (single-base differentiation), speedy (<2 hours), and stable (>10 weeks shelf life). This inexpensive, ultraportable POCKET platform may become a versatile sample-to-answer platform for clinical diagnostics, food safety, agricultural protection, and environmental monitoring."

                            "In practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (Ghazi et al., 2016). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety."

                            "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring (Petrenko, 2008)21,(Petrenko et al., 2000)(Petrenko et al., 2004)(Petrenko et al., 2003)",
                            "Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58](Brigati et al., 2008). In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected (Brigati et al., 2004). To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation (Sorokulova et al., 2005)."

Similarly, Soendergaard et al. identified an optimal peptide for ovarian cancer diagnosis, enabling the direct application of radioactive indium ( 111 In) labeling for conventional SPECT/CT instrumentation [189]. The use of M13 phages as detection probes provides an additional diagnostic avenue. Ferreira et al. employed an M13 phage display platform to visualize colorectal cancer cells via specific MCT1 marker binding (Ferreira et al., 2019). Lee et al. encoded a lungcancer-targeting peptide, Pep-1, on M13 phages, enabling non-invasive live in vivo imaging with a near-infrared microscope (Lee et al., 2016). Salles et al. ingeniously mimicked a Leishmania infantum epitope using an M13 phage display, achieving 100% specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing human visceral leishmaniasis [192]."

                            "Colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the absence of early clinical indicators. Hence, the identification of new targeting molecules is crucial for an early detection and development of targeted therapies. This study aimed to identify and characterize novel peptides specific for the colorectal cancer cell line RKO using a phage-displayed peptide library. After four rounds of selection plus a negative step with normal colorectal cells, CCD-841-CoN, there was an obvious phage enrichment that specifically bound to RKO cells. Cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the most specific peptides leading to the selection of the peptide sequence CPKSNNGVC. Through fluorescence microscopy and cytometry, the synthetic peptide RKOpep was shown to specifically bind to RKO cells, as well as to other human colorectal cancer cells including Caco-2, HCT 116 and HCT-15, but not to the normal non-cancer cells. Moreover, it was shown that RKOpep specifically targeted human colorectal cancer cell tissues. A bioinformatics analysis suggested that the RKOpep targets the monocarboxylate transporter 1, which has been implicated in colorectal cancer progression and prognosis, proven through gene knockdown approaches and shown by immunocytochemistry co-localization studies. The peptide herein identified can be a potential candidate for targeted therapies for colorectal cancer."

These recombinant antibodies can be engineered for specific diagnostic needs, allowing for rapid development of diverse detection formats with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology enables the development of various antibody formats that provide distinct advantages for diagnostic applications. Single-chain variable fragments (scFv), Fab fragments, and nanobodies derived through phage display are significantly smaller than conventional IgG antibodies, which can be advantageous in biosensing applications where size matters <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Nanobodies, in particular, offer unique benefits including high affinity, exceptional stability, improved solubility, and long CDR3 loops that can access hidden epitopes on target proteins that may be inaccessible to conventional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"201228624\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA major advantage of phage display technology is the ability to rapidly generate antibodies without animal immunization. The selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries offers access to very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and affordably <Paper corpusId=\"259226246\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This in vitro technology circumvents the limitations of the immune system, theoretically allowing the generation of antibodies against all conceivable molecules <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, phage display enables obtaining human antibodies from na\u00efve antibody gene libraries when patients are not available or when immunization is not ethically feasible <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of phage display-derived antibodies makes them particularly attractive for diagnostic applications. These recombinant antibodies can be collected quickly at lower costs while maintaining comparable affinity to traditional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This economic advantage becomes increasingly important when developing diagnostic platforms for resource-limited settings or when large quantities of antibodies are required.\n\nAnother significant benefit is the versatility and adaptability of phage display-derived antibodies. Since the DNA sequence encoding these antibodies is directly available, they can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs optimized for specific diagnostic applications <Paper corpusId=\"259226246\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This engineering potential allows for the development of a wide range of antibody-based diagnostic formats, from traditional ELISAs to advanced biosensor applications.\n\nFor diagnostic interfaces that require robust recognition elements capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions, landscape phage display offers a novel solution. Unlike traditional monoclonal antibodies that may be limited by sensitivity to environmental stresses, landscape phage probes demonstrate enhanced stability under extreme conditions <Paper corpusId=\"46974853\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These phage-derived probes have been successfully developed against various pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis spores and Salmonella typhimurium, showing preferential binding to their targets compared to closely related species <Paper corpusId=\"46974853\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"14522617\" paperTitle=\"(Brigati et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe high-affinity binding capabilities of phage display-derived antibodies enable sensitive detection of target molecules. For example, VHH (nanobody) constructs immobilized onto sensor surfaces have demonstrated the ability to detect subnanogram per milliliter concentrations of human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"29607203\" paperTitle=\"(Saerens et al., 2005)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, phage display has enabled the development of highly sensitive immunoassays for small molecules such as morphine, with detection limits as low as 5 ng/mL in dipstick formats <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"103755888\" paperTitle=\"(Gandhi et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurthermore, phage display technology facilitates the development of antibodies with exquisite specificity. Serotype-specific antibodies against dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) have been isolated using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy, enabling simultaneous detection and serotyping of dengue virus in human serum <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22482975\" paperTitle=\"(Lebani et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has advantages over immunization techniques where avoiding antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes is challenging <Paper corpusId=\"22482975\" paperTitle=\"(Lebani et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor detecting groups of similar compounds, phage display has enabled the development of broad-spectrum noncompetitive immunoassays. A notable example is an assay for cyanobacterial microcystins and nodularins that can detect all 11 commonly occurring hepatotoxins at concentrations below 0.1 \u03bcg/L in a one-hour assay, far below the World Health Organization's guideline limit <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"23089753\" paperTitle=\"(Akter et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring (Petrenko, 2008)21,(Petrenko et al., 2000)(Petrenko et al., 2004)(Petrenko et al., 2003)",
                            "Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58](Brigati et al., 2008). In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected (Brigati et al., 2004). To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation (Sorokulova et al., 2005)."

                            "BACKGROUND\nRecent use of Bacillus anthracis spores as a bioweapon has highlighted the need for a continuous monitoring system. Current monitoring systems rely on antibody-derived probes, which are not hardy enough to withstand long-term use under extreme conditions. We describe new, phage-derived probes that can be used as robust substitutes for antibodies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom a landscape phage library with random octapeptides displayed on all copies of the major phage coat protein of the phage fd-tet, we selected clones that bound to spores of B. anthracis (Sterne strain). ELISA, micropanning, and coprecipitation assays were used to evaluate the specificity and selectivity with which these phage bound to B. anthracis spores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPeptides on the selected clones directed binding of the phage to B. anthracis spores. Most clones exhibited little or no binding to spores of distantly related Bacillus species, but some binding was observed with spores of closely related species. Our most specific spore-binding phage displayed a peptide EPRLSPHS (several thousand peptides per phage) and bound 3.5- to 70-fold better to spores of B. anthracis Sterne than to spores of other Bacillus species.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe selected phage probes bound preferentially to B. anthracis Sterne spores compared with other Bacillus species. These phage could possibly be further developed into highly specific and robust probes suitable for long-term use in continuous monitoring devices and biosorbents."

                            "The specificity and affinity characteristics of antibodies make them excellent probes in biosensor applications. Unfortunately, their large size, unstable behavior, and random immobilization properties create numerous problems. The single-domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (termed VHH) offers special advantages in terms of size, stability, and ease of generating different antibody constructs. In this study, we show the potential of those VHHs in sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) by SPR technology. Different VHH constructs were immobilized onto commercial and custom-built sensor surfaces by metal chelation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, or covalent coupling. The detection of subnanogram per milliliter hPSA concentrations could be attained on a covalently coupled three-dimensional dextran surface. Moreover, the ratio of different hPSA isoform concentrations could be assessed via a sandwich assay and resulted in the detection of clinically significant antigen concentrations within 15 min. In addition, for the first time, the intrinsic protein stability is presented as an important probe design factor, since our results reveal that higher intrinsic stability offers higher resistance to harsh regeneration conditions. In conclusion, we present VHHs as a novel class of biosensor probes rivaling conventional antibodies and their derived antibody fragments."

Herein, we report the development of a dipstick using a AuNP-labeled single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody for the detection of morphine. The scFv antibodies for morphine were developed using phage display-based antibody library. Immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH)- and light (VL)-chain genes were connected via a glycine\u2013serine linker isolated from murine immune repertoire and cloned into the expression vector pIT2. The scFv was produced in Escherichia coli HB2151, yielding a functional protein with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. The morphine scFv was labeled with gold nanoparticles and used as an optical immunoprobe in a dipstick. The competitive dipstick assay characterized the ability of the scFv antibody to recognize free morphine. The detection range was 1\u20131000 ng mL\u22121 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 ng mL\u22121 under optimal conditions, and the IC50 value was 14 ng mL\u22121 for morphine. The developed optical dipstick kit of scFv antibody was capable of specifically binding to free morphine and its analogs in a solution in less than 5 min and could be useful for on-site screening of a real sample in blood, urine, and saliva."

Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability."

                            "A broad-spectrum noncompetitive immunoassay allowing sensitive and simple detection of a group of similar compounds would be an ideal tool for screening low-molecular weight analytes (<2000 Da) having many variants. However, the development of an essential antibody pair capable of sandwich-type recognition of the analytes' small generic core structure is a demanding task due to limited space available for simultaneous binding of two different antibodies. We report here a generic noncompetitive assay for cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) and nodularins (Nod), a group of structurally related small cyclic peptides (\u223c1000 Da) with more than 100 naturally occurring analogs. The assay is based on the unique combination of a generic anti-immunocomplex (anti-IC) single-chain fragment of antibody variable domain (scFv) and a monoclonal antibody capable of binding to an Adda-group (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4(E),6(E)-dienoic acid) present in all MCs/Nod. The anti-IC scFv was isolated from a large synthetic antibody library with phage display and used to develop a single-step sandwich-type noncompetitive immunocomplex assay. The sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometry-based assay is capable of detecting all the 11 tested commonly occurring hepatotoxins (MC-LR, -dmlR, -RR, -dmRR, -LA, -LY, -LF, -LW, -YR, -WR, and Nod-R) at concentration below 0.1 \u03bcg/L in a 1 h assay. Using MC-LR, the most studied toxic and widely distributed of the toxins, the calculated detection limits (based on blank + 3SD response) are \u223c0.026 \u03bcg/L in 1 h and \u223c0.1 \u03bcg/L in 10 min assay time. This is by far the fastest reported immunoassay for MCs and Nod with a detection limit far below the World Health Organization's guideline limit (1 \u03bcg/L of MC-LR equivalent in drinking water). The assay was validated with spiked tap and lake water as well as with environmental surface water samples. The developed assay provides a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive tool for the quantitative detection of MCs/Nod with the additional benefit of automation and high-throughput possibilities for large scale screening of drinking and environmental surface water samples. Furthermore, the study describes the first demonstration of the assay intended for the detection of an analyte group comprising similar low-molecular weight compounds exhibiting the benefits of a reagent excess type assay."
