RNA nanomedicine has significant potential in the management of liver diseases, where optimal management would benefit from targeted delivery, doses titrated to liver metabolism, and personalized therapy based on the specific site of interest. In this review, we discuss in-depth the different types of RNA and nanocarriers used for liver targeting along with their specific applications in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, liver fibrosis, and liver cancers. We further highlight the strategies for cell-specific delivery and future perspectives in this field of research with the emergence of small activating RNA, circular RNA, and RNA base editing approaches.",

For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. [79] Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. [80] elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. [81] NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). [26,82,83] In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models. [79] In the liver, it is crucial to specifically target the cells of interest since different liver diseases involve specific liver cells, and nonspecific targeting could result in toxic accumulation and significantly lower therapeutic effect.",

Bhat\n## Abstract\nThe remarkable impact of RNA nanomedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the expansive therapeutic potential of this field in diverse disease contexts. In recent years, RNA nanomedicine targeting the liver has been paradigm-shifting in the management of metabolic diseases such as hyperoxaluria and amyloidosis. RNA nanomedicine has significant potential in the management of liver diseases, where optimal management would benefit from targeted delivery, doses titrated to liver metabolism, and personalized therapy based on the specific site of interest. In this review, we discuss in-depth the different types of RNA and nanocarriers used for liver targeting along with their specific applications in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, liver fibrosis, and liver cancers. We further highlight the strategies for cell-specific delivery and future perspectives in this field of research with the emergence of small activating RNA, circular RNA, and RNA base editing approaches.\n## Lipid nanoparticles\nThis is largely impacted by the amount and length of PEG-lipids in LNPs. For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. [79] Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. [80] elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. [81] NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). [26,82,83] In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models. [79] In the liver, it is crucial to specifically target the cells of interest since different liver diseases involve specific liver cells, and nonspecific targeting could result in toxic accumulation and significantly lower therapeutic effect.",

                    "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs of LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does not necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mechanism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease. \n\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1).",

The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

The current state of the art for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery is lipid nanoparticles (LNP), which are composed of cholesterol, a helper lipid, a PEGylated lipid and an ionizable amine-containing lipid.

This review will concentrate on the current efforts to develop the next generation of tissue-targeted LNP constructs for therapeutic nucleic acids.\n## Inherent LNP Liver Tropism\nThe liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous admin istration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutane ous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs o LNP accumulation in descending order [27].

The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

These lipids become positively charged in the acidic endosomal environment. 20 This protonation disrupts the endosomal membrane by inducing a phase transition from the lamellar phase to a nonlamellar inverted hexagonal phase, which releases the payload into the cytosol. 21 The proton sponge effect also further helps this process by increasing osmotic pressure and rupturing the endosome. 20 By binding to ApoE, ionizable lipids help guide LNPs to hepatocytes via LDL receptors. 22 The lipid composition can also be tailored to improve ApoE interaction and maximize uptake efficiency. 23 uch as quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) have delivered essential data on lipid-protein interactions for ApoE-mediated targeting. 24 These developments have improved our understanding of how LNP compositions influence ApoE interactions and biodistribution pathways. Developments in LNP design, e.g., using selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules, have improved tissue specificity. By modifying lipid composition, SORT molecules help target organs beyond the liver, expanding LNP-based therapies. SORT molecules are specific lipids added as a fifth component to conventional four-component LNPs. The chemical structure of these molecules determines organ specificity: ionizable lipids enhance liver targeting, anionic lipids direct LNPs to the spleen, and permanent cationic lipids with quaternary ammonium groups increase lung targeting. SORT molecules function through interaction with specific plasma proteins after PEG-lipid shedding.",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

                    "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.",

However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery.

Understanding of biodistribution and liver-specific tropism\n# Venue: Molecular Therapy: Methods & Clinical Development\n# Authors: M. Hosseini-Kharat, K. Bremmell, C. Prestidge\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\n2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17\n...\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17 Their physicochemical attributes-such as size, surface charge, and lipid composition-are key in shaping their intracellular pathways and optimizing biodistribution efficiency. 18 For example, ionizable lipids with specific acid dissociation constants (pKa) improve endosomal escape by optimizing the charge interactions within the endosome. 19 The pKa values of ionizable lipids cause them to remain neutral at physiological pH and reduce off-target effects. These lipids become positively charged in the acidic endosomal environment. 20 This protonation disrupts the endosomal membrane by inducing a phase transition from the lamellar phase to a nonlamellar inverted hexagonal phase, which releases the payload into the cytosol. 21 The proton sponge effect also further helps this process by increasing osmotic pressure and rupturing the endosome. 20 By binding to ApoE, ionizable lipids help guide LNPs to hepatocytes via LDL receptors. 22 The lipid composition can also be tailored to improve ApoE interaction and maximize uptake efficiency. 23 uch as quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) have delivered essential data on lipid-protein interactions for ApoE-mediated targeting. 24 These developments have improved our understanding of how LNP compositions influence ApoE interactions and biodistribution pathways. Developments in LNP design, e.g., using selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules, have improved tissue specificity. By modifying lipid composition, SORT molecules help target organs beyond the liver, expanding LNP-based therapies. SORT molecules are specific lipids added as a fifth component to conventional four-component LNPs. The chemical structure of these molecules determines organ specificity: ionizable lipids enhance liver targeting, anionic lipids direct LNPs to the spleen, and permanent cationic lipids with quaternary ammonium groups increase lung targeting. SORT molecules function through interaction with specific plasma proteins after PEG-lipid shedding.\n\n## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIVER CELL TYPES AND LNPs\nFinally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23 Given their high endocytic capacity and strategic location in liver sinusoids, LSECs are essential to the liver's clearance of circulating LNPs. \n\nSago et al. 32 investigated how specific liver cell subtypes-Kupffer cells, liver endothelial cells, and hepatocytes-interacted with LNPs. LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34\n\n## LNP COMPOSITION AND LIVER TARGETING\nLNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.\n...\nSORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66 ese improvements in LNP design and targeting have opened the door to transformative therapeutic applications. A review by D'Alessio et al. 41 discussed how LNPs can be used for liver-targeted gene therapy in inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs). By naturally accumulating in the liver, LNPs deliver therapeutic mRNA and gene-editing components directly to hepatocytes, helping to detoxify harmful metabolites and address enzyme deficiencies associated with these conditions. This detoxification occurs through the correction of enzyme deficiencies, enabling hepatocytes to process and eliminate toxic substrates that would otherwise accumulate and cause systemic damage.\n\n## ANALYSIS OF LIVER-TARGETED LNP STUDIES\nKey examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72\n...\nSiloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72 5) LNPs proved promising in liver-targeted therapies, enabling applications, e.g., cancer treatment, gene editing, metabolic restoration, and gene silencing. For example, circUGP2 LNPs inhibited tumor progression via p53 activation while partially targeting Kupffer cells. 33 Cre mRNA-loaded COATSOMESS-OP also achieved precise gene editing in hepatocytes (Cre mRNA encodes the Cre recombinase enzyme). 73 Biodegradable LNPs delivered ARG1 mRNA for metabolic restoration in arginase deficiency models, 74 and CL4H6 siRNA-loaded LNPs efficiently silenced hepatocyte genes with high specificity. 75 (6) Target cell specificity is a requirement for successful delivery. \n\nKupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery. For example, anionic LNPs targeted Kupffer cells and LSECs through stabilin receptors, 45 while GalNAc-LNPs entered hepatocytes through asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor-mediated uptake, independent of LDL receptor. 81 (7) Some LNP formulations demonstrated extrahepatic targeting beyond the liver.",

                    "text": "A number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase",

Witzigmann, J. Kulkarni, Jerry Leung, Sam Chen, P. Cullis, R. van der Meel\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Optimizing LNP characteristics\nA number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase",

Currently, efforts have been mainly made to construct targeted LNPs for organ- or cell-type-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs by conjugation with various types of ligands. In this review, we describe the surface engineering strategies for nucleic acid-LNPs, considering ligand types, conjugation chemistries, and incorporation methods. We then outline the general purification and characterization techniques that are frequently used following the engineering step and emphasize the specific techniques for certain types of ligands. Next, we comprehensively summarize the currently accessible organs and cell types, as well as the other applications of the engineered LNPs. Finally, we provide considerations for formulating targeted LNPs and discuss the challenges of successfully translating the \u201cproof of concept\u201d from the laboratory into the clinic. We believe that addressing these challenges could accelerate the development of surface-engineered LNPs for targeted nucleic acid delivery and beyond.",

However, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDLR activity is low and may not be sufficient to mediate the efficient hepatic entry of administered LNPs (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). Therefore, an alternative to endogenous ApoE-based targeting is highly desired. The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al. 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes. More recently, this strategy was further validated in an LDLR-deficient non-human primate (NHP) model, where LNPs modified with a rationally designed ASGPR-targeted GL6 ligand effectively delivered adenine base editing mRNA to the liver, leading to efficient base editing of the ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3) gene (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). While both ApoE-based endogenous targeting and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting enable potent LNP delivery to hepatocytes, targeted and efficient delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) remains a challenge.",

SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al. 2021). Different from endogenous targeting via serum proteins, numerous ligands were utilized to functionalize LNPs to achieve targeted nucleic acid delivery through active targeting.

Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

Currently, efforts have been mainly made to construct targeted LNPs for organ- or cell-type-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs by conjugation with various types of ligands. In this review, we describe the surface engineering strategies for nucleic acid-LNPs, considering ligand types, conjugation chemistries, and incorporation methods. We then outline the general purification and characterization techniques that are frequently used following the engineering step and emphasize the specific techniques for certain types of ligands. Next, we comprehensively summarize the currently accessible organs and cell types, as well as the other applications of the engineered LNPs. Finally, we provide considerations for formulating targeted LNPs and discuss the challenges of successfully translating the \u201cproof of concept\u201d from the laboratory into the clinic. We believe that addressing these challenges could accelerate the development of surface-engineered LNPs for targeted nucleic acid delivery and beyond.\n## SURFACE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES\nUpon systemic administration, the shedding of PEG-lipids breaks the equilibrium of surface lipid compositions, which promotes the adsorption of serum proteins to the surface of LNPs (Dilliard et al. 2021). The adsorbed proteins are expected to possibly influence organ tropism of LNPs (Cheng et al. 2020;Dilliard et al. 2021), and this assumption was evidenced by the finding that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) facilitated hepatic entry of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes in the liver (Akinc et al. 2010). \n\nBased on the different surface states of LNPs mentioned above (Fig. 1), the surface engineering strategies can be classified into three main categories: \n\n(1) substitution of PEGylated dimyristoyl lipid; \n\n(2) alteration of surface charge; and (3) modification with targeting ligand. Furthermore, these strategies can be achieved either by direct incorporation of presynthesized molecules or by in situ conjugation of targeting moieties. Specific chemicals and preparation methods are summarized in the following sections.\n\n## PURPOSES OF SURFACE ENGINEERING\nFollowing systemic administration, LNPs undergo desorption of PEG-lipids and adsorption of soluble ApoE on their surface, which facilitates hepatic entry by the improved binding to LDLR that is heavily expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes (Akinc et al. 2010). To expand the scope of LNPs to non-hepatic cells, Cheng et al. developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and achieved spleen-and lungselective mRNA delivery by incorporating anionic phospholipids and permanently cationic lipids into conventional four-component LNPs, respectively (Cheng et al. 2020). SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al. 2021). Different from endogenous targeting via serum proteins, numerous ligands were utilized to functionalize LNPs to achieve targeted nucleic acid delivery through active targeting. In this section, we summarize the currently reachable organs and cell types by ligand-modified nucleic acid-LNPs (supplementary Table S2).\n\n## Targeting liver cells\nAs discussed above, nucleic acid-LNPs have demonstrated utilities in the treatment of liver diseases since they are mainly taken up by hepatocytes in the liver via LDLR-mediated endocytosis (Akinc et al. 2010). However, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDLR activity is low and may not be sufficient to mediate the efficient hepatic entry of administered LNPs (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). Therefore, an alternative to endogenous ApoE-based targeting is highly desired. The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al. 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes. More recently, this strategy was further validated in an LDLR-deficient non-human primate (NHP) model, where LNPs modified with a rationally designed ASGPR-targeted GL6 ligand effectively delivered adenine base editing mRNA to the liver, leading to efficient base editing of the ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3) gene (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). While both ApoE-based endogenous targeting and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting enable potent LNP delivery to hepatocytes, targeted and efficient delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) remains a challenge.\n\n## Other purposes\nThe liver tropism limitation of conventional LNPs substantially drives the development of non-hepatic organ-and specific cell type-targeted LNPs by surface engineering with various targeting ligands. Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge.

For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.\n...\nHowever, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR. Given this, Andrew M. Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.\n...\nIn the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes.

The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.\n\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).\n\n## DISCUSSION\nMoreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae. This additionally reduced the uptake of LNPs to hepatocytes and allowed more selective uptake into the LSECs. Collectively, our results successfully demonstrated the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver by controlling physical size of LNPs, PEG-lipid content, and incorporation of active targeting ligands. Overall, this approach may offer new strategies to develop cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver and other tissues.",

                    "text": "The default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

Wang, Yaopeng Ding, Kellie Chong, Meng Cui, Zeyu Cao, Chenjue Tang, Zhen Tian, Yuping Hu, Yu Zhao, Shaoyi Jiang\n## Abstract\nIntroduction: The advent of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for mRNA therapeutics has revolutionized the biomedical field, particularly in treating infectious diseases, cancer, genetic disorders, and metabolic diseases. Recent Advances in Therapeutic LNPs: LNPs, composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, facilitate efficient cellular uptake and cytosolic release of mRNA while mitigating degradation by nucleases. However, as synthetic entities, LNPs face challenges that alter their therapeutic efficacy and safety concerns. Toxicity/Reactogenicity/Immunogenicity: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in LNP research, focusing on preclinical safety assessments encompassing toxicity, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Summary and Outlook: Additionally, it outlines potential strategies for addressing these challenges and offers insights into future research directions for enhancing the application of LNPs in mRNA therapeutics.\n## Ionizable Lipids for Constructing Selective Organ-Targeting LNPs\nThe default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

                    "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

Although challenges remain in terms of delivery efficiency, specific tissue targeting, toxicity, and storage stability, mRNA\u2013LNP technology holds extensive potential for the treatment of diseases.\n## Kupffer Cell-and Liver Endothelial Cell-Targeted LNPs\nKupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.",

This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

Harashima\n## Abstract\nIntroduction The development of targeted drug delivery systems is a rapidly growing area in the field of nanomedicine. Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.\n## Discussion\nThe aim of this study was to improve the targeting efficiency of an LNP by optimizing the dissociation constant (pKa) value for its membrane, which reflects its ionization property or surface charge. This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges. This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

The lack of long-lasting effects of non-viral vectors is an advantage for infectious disease vaccines. With the introduction of microfluidic processes that facilitate the encapsulation of nucleic acid cargo, lipid nanoparticles are being studied as delivery vehicles for various RNA-based biopharmaceuticals. In particular, using microfluidic chip-based fabrication processes, nucleic acids such as RNA and proteins can be effectively incorporated into lipid nanoparticles and utilized as delivery vehicles for various biopharmaceuticals. Due to the successful development of mRNA therapies, lipid nanoparticles have emerged as a promising approach for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals of various types (DNA, mRNA, short RNA, proteins) possess expression mechanisms that are suitable for manufacturing personalized cancer vaccines, while also requiring formulation with lipid nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the basic design of lipid nanoparticles, the types of biopharmaceuticals used as carriers, and the microfluidic processes involved. We then present research cases focusing on lipid-nanoparticle-based immune modulation and discuss the current status of commercially available lipid nanoparticles, as well as future prospects for the development of lipid nanoparticles for immune regulation purposes.",

                    "text": "LNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

Shim\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, with the approval of preventative vaccines for pandemics, lipid nanoparticles have become a prominent RNA delivery vehicle. The lack of long-lasting effects of non-viral vectors is an advantage for infectious disease vaccines. With the introduction of microfluidic processes that facilitate the encapsulation of nucleic acid cargo, lipid nanoparticles are being studied as delivery vehicles for various RNA-based biopharmaceuticals. In particular, using microfluidic chip-based fabrication processes, nucleic acids such as RNA and proteins can be effectively incorporated into lipid nanoparticles and utilized as delivery vehicles for various biopharmaceuticals. Due to the successful development of mRNA therapies, lipid nanoparticles have emerged as a promising approach for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals of various types (DNA, mRNA, short RNA, proteins) possess expression mechanisms that are suitable for manufacturing personalized cancer vaccines, while also requiring formulation with lipid nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the basic design of lipid nanoparticles, the types of biopharmaceuticals used as carriers, and the microfluidic processes involved. We then present research cases focusing on lipid-nanoparticle-based immune modulation and discuss the current status of commercially available lipid nanoparticles, as well as future prospects for the development of lipid nanoparticles for immune regulation purposes.\n## Target Organs of Lipid Nanoparticles\nLNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

However, their clinical use has been limited to extracellular applications due to their inability to cross plasma membranes. Overcoming this physiological barrier would unlock the potential of protein drugs for the treatment of many intractable diseases. In this review, we highlight progress made toward achieving cytosolic delivery of recombinant proteins. We start by first considering intracellular protein delivery as a drug modality compared to existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drug modalities. Then, we summarize strategies that have been reported to achieve protein internalization. These techniques can be broadly classified into 3 categories: physical methods, direct protein engineering, and nanocarrier-mediated delivery. Finally, we highlight existing challenges for cytosolic protein delivery and offer an outlook for future advances.",

This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell. Thus, one strategy for targeting exosomes to the correct tissue is to isolate them from the same types of cells as the target.",

However, their clinical use has been limited to extracellular applications due to their inability to cross plasma membranes. Overcoming this physiological barrier would unlock the potential of protein drugs for the treatment of many intractable diseases. In this review, we highlight progress made toward achieving cytosolic delivery of recombinant proteins. We start by first considering intracellular protein delivery as a drug modality compared to existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drug modalities. Then, we summarize strategies that have been reported to achieve protein internalization. These techniques can be broadly classified into 3 categories: physical methods, direct protein engineering, and nanocarrier-mediated delivery. Finally, we highlight existing challenges for cytosolic protein delivery and offer an outlook for future advances.\n## Tissue targeting\nNotably, liver accumulation is known to correlate positively with particle size. This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell. Thus, one strategy for targeting exosomes to the correct tissue is to isolate them from the same types of cells as the target.",

Adding PEG lipids to LNPs increases circulation half-life, essential for effective in vivo delivery [288]. However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference [288]. LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors [288,289]. This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein [288,290]. After cellular uptake, endosomal escape of siRNA into the cytosol is facilitated through interactions between ionizable cationic lipids and anionic endogenous lipids in the endosomal membrane [291], enabling siRNA to silence the targeted gene.",

Anwar, Farin Mir, T. Yokota\n## Abstract\nOligonucleotide-based therapies are a promising approach for treating a wide range of hard-to-treat diseases, particularly genetic and rare diseases. These therapies involve the use of short synthetic sequences of DNA or RNA that can modulate gene expression or inhibit proteins through various mechanisms. Despite the potential of these therapies, a significant barrier to their widespread use is the difficulty in ensuring their uptake by target cells/tissues. Strategies to overcome this challenge include cell-penetrating peptide conjugation, chemical modification, nanoparticle formulation, and the use of endogenous vesicles, spherical nucleic acids, and smart material-based delivery vehicles. This article provides an overview of these strategies and their potential for the efficient delivery of oligonucleotide drugs, as well as the safety and toxicity considerations, regulatory requirements, and challenges in translating these therapies from the laboratory to the clinic.\n## Lipoplex, Liposomes, and Lipid Nanoparticles\nPEG lipids are often prudently added to the LNPs to stabilize the structure during manufacturing and storage [279,288]. Adding PEG lipids to LNPs increases circulation half-life, essential for effective in vivo delivery [288]. However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference [288]. LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors [288,289]. This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein [288,290]. After cellular uptake, endosomal escape of siRNA into the cytosol is facilitated through interactions between ionizable cationic lipids and anionic endogenous lipids in the endosomal membrane [291], enabling siRNA to silence the targeted gene.",

Encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles was an essential factor in the successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines, which conclusively demonstrated the technology's potential to yield approved medicines. In this review, we begin by describing current advances in mRNA modifications, design of novel lipids and development of lipid nanoparticle components for mRNA-based drugs. Then, we summarize key points pertaining to preclinical and clinical development of mRNA therapeutics. Finally, we cover topics related to targeted delivery systems, including endosomal escape and targeting of immune cells, tumors and organs for use with mRNA vaccines and new treatment modalities for human diseases.",

                    "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

J. L. P. Perez, Monika Kumari, Guan-Hong Chen, Ming-Hsiang Hong, Yin-Shiou Lin, Ching-Hang Liu, Shih-Han Ko, C. A. P. Concio, Yi-Jen Su, Yi-Han Chang, Wen-Shan Li, Han-Chung Wu\n## Abstract\nRealizing the immense clinical potential of mRNA-based drugs will require continued development of methods to safely deliver the bioactive agents with high efficiency and without triggering side effects. In this regard, lipid nanoparticles have been successfully utilized to improve mRNA delivery and protect the cargo from extracellular degradation. Encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles was an essential factor in the successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines, which conclusively demonstrated the technology's potential to yield approved medicines. In this review, we begin by describing current advances in mRNA modifications, design of novel lipids and development of lipid nanoparticle components for mRNA-based drugs. Then, we summarize key points pertaining to preclinical and clinical development of mRNA therapeutics. Finally, we cover topics related to targeted delivery systems, including endosomal escape and targeting of immune cells, tumors and organs for use with mRNA vaccines and new treatment modalities for human diseases.\n## Endogenous targeting\nOne approach involves modified LNPs to interact with endogenous proteins that are present in specific tissues or cell types. These interactions can enhance the uptake of LNPs by target cells, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic payloads such as nucleic acids or drugs. Since surface charge, size and lipid components of nanoparticles have been reported to modulate delivery to specific organs, researchers have created some modified LNPs that interact with endogenous proteins to provide tissue specificity [120,141]. When LNPs have a neutral surface charge, the formation of complexes between LNPs and apoE facilitates transport to the liver and uptake by hepatocytes and hepatoma cells through LDL receptors [202]. LNPs conjugated with apoE are successfully targeted the central nervous system, crossing the bloodbrain barrier and releasing an anticholinergic drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease [203]. In contrast, LNPs with anionic charge can be utilized to facilitate delivery to spleen via adsorption to \u03b22-glycoprotein I [204,205]. In addition, the different phospholipids not only affect LNP tissue-tropism but may also interfere with the biological process of protein translation [206].\n\n## Organ targeting\nAlthough LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising carriers for producing clinically approved products in the future. Compared with other systems used for nonviral gene delivery, LNPs provide several advantages including higher stability, low toxicity, and greater efficiency. Additionally, systems based on LNPs can be modified with ligands and devices for controlled biodistribution and internalization into specific cells. Efforts are ongoing to improve the efficiency of lipid-based gene vectors. These efforts depend on the appropriate design of nanocarriers as well as the development of new lipids with improved gene delivery ability. Several ionizable lipids have recently been developed and have shown dramatically improved efficiency. However, enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to target specific cells in the body remains the most difficult challenge. Systemically administered LNPs can access organs in which the capillaries are characterized by the presence of fenestrations, such as the liver and spleen. The liver has received the most attention to date, although targeted delivery to the spleen has recently emerged as a promising tool for modulating the immune system. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids. We focus mainly on targeting liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells as excellent targets for gene therapy. We also discuss the potential of endothelial cells as an alternate approach for targeting organs with a continuous endothelium.",

Khalil, M. Younis, Seigo Kimura, H. Harashima\n## Abstract\nThe last few years have witnessed a great advance in the development of nonviral systems for in vivo targeted delivery of nucleic acids. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising carriers for producing clinically approved products in the future. Compared with other systems used for nonviral gene delivery, LNPs provide several advantages including higher stability, low toxicity, and greater efficiency. Additionally, systems based on LNPs can be modified with ligands and devices for controlled biodistribution and internalization into specific cells. Efforts are ongoing to improve the efficiency of lipid-based gene vectors. These efforts depend on the appropriate design of nanocarriers as well as the development of new lipids with improved gene delivery ability. Several ionizable lipids have recently been developed and have shown dramatically improved efficiency. However, enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to target specific cells in the body remains the most difficult challenge. Systemically administered LNPs can access organs in which the capillaries are characterized by the presence of fenestrations, such as the liver and spleen. The liver has received the most attention to date, although targeted delivery to the spleen has recently emerged as a promising tool for modulating the immune system. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids. We focus mainly on targeting liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells as excellent targets for gene therapy. We also discuss the potential of endothelial cells as an alternate approach for targeting organs with a continuous endothelium.\n## Active Targeting for Hepatic Gene Delivery\nTo ensure selective internalization into hepatocytes, LNPs can be functionalized with various targeting ligands that have particular affinity for overexpressed receptors in the target cells. For example, galactose 80) and GalNAc 81) have been extensively used to target the asialoglycoprotein receptor in hepatocytes. Modification of LNPs prepared with KC2 lipid with the GalNAc ligand significantly improved siRNA delivery in ApoE-deficient mice. GalNAc has been also used for preparing a smart dynamic polyconjugate system. 82) This system uses acid-labile PEG lipids that dissociate in the acidic medium of the endosome to facilitate endosomal destabilization. Tros de Ilarduya et al. used transferrin-modified LPXs for efficient delivery of luciferase-expressing pDNA to hepatocytes. 83) The incorporation of protamine in LNPs significantly improved gene transfer efficiency, which was attributed to improved nuclear delivery. 83) LNPs can also be targeted to liver cells other than hepatocytes. LNPs based on hyaluronic acidmodified sphingosine 1-phophate (HA-S1P) were developed to target HA receptors in LSECs to treat ischemia-reperfusion injury. 84) Narmada et al. used vitamin A-coupled liposomes to deliver pDNA encoding the hepatocyte growth factor gene to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) for the amelioration of liver fibrosis. 85) Huang's group designed LCP NPs that were surface modified with aminoethyl anisamide to target the sigma-1 receptor in aHSCs and deliver pDNA expressing the antifibrotic peptide relaxin. 86) .4. Next-Generation LNPs for Hepatic Gene Delivery Although active targeting by specific ligands is widely used, challenges include the complexity of delivery systems, the probability of detachment of ligands from the nanocarriers after systemic administration, and the necessity for perfect ligand-receptor interaction. 87)",

                    "text": "The most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al.

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Liver targeting\nThe most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38].",

            "abstract": "RNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

Pandey, H. Uluda\u01e7\n## Abstract\nRNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## Summary and Future Perspective\nAn ideal LNP system must meet multiple requirements such as particle size in the order of 80 nm, sufficient stability and penetration through the liver fenestrae, and lack of inflammatory reactions, immunogenicity, and cytotoxic effects in a host. Other biological barriers include protection by nucleases, evading the MPS, and renal glomerular filtration for effective systemic distribution. The surface engineering of LNPs offers stability and target efficiency, which in turn improves the efficacy of loaded therapeutics, i.e., siRNA. The apparent pKa value of IL in the range of ~6.4 with a neutral surface charge is desirable to avoid sequestration by MPS. Thorough investigations of the ideal (or desirable) LNP structure(s), however, remain to be fully explored in different indications. It is possible that certain LNP configurations might be more advantageous for certain indications (e.g., provide better delivery at the disease site), but this issue remains to be investigated in a systematic way.

            "text": "Although reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "LNPs are the most researched liver-specific targeting nanosystems loaded with mRNA. The main liver-specific targeting mechanisms are passive and endogenous targeting, owing to the structure and function of the liver. Research indicates that LNPs with a pKa value of six -seven are best-suited for mRNA delivery to the liver [114]. Among them, ionizable cationic lipids containing amino groups, such as DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) [46], 5A2-SC8 [103], 306O i10 [104], and cationic lipid-modified aminoglycosides (CLAs) [105] exhibit high liver-targeting efficacy. The distribution of the LNPs with amino groups in liver can be as high as 81%, with the mRNA expression over 90% [104]. Nevertheless, the targeted precision delivery of mRNA should be carefully evaluated at the cellular level, as the degree of mRNA expression varies among different liver cell types in the above-mentioned research. \n\nHepatocytes account for about 80% of liver tissue and are implicated in many hereditary diseases, making them the primary targets for mRNA delivery. To enter the Disse space and directly contact hepatocytes, mRNA-LNPs for hepatocyte-targeted delivery are generally smaller than the fenestration of hepatic vascular endothelium, which measures approximately 150 nm. Hashiba et al. [115] synthesized a series of mRNA-LNPs with varying particle sizes and demonstrated that LNPs with sizes ranging from 60 to 100 nm can pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae of the liver, enhancing the hepatocyte targeting efficiency of mRNAs. Siegwart et al. [106,116,117] proposed a selector organ targeting (SORT) strategy (Fig. 7A). They synthesized 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs with a particle size of approximately 122 nm. Incorporation of 20% ionizable cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) into LNPs improved the uptake efficiency of hepatocytes to as high as 93% [106].",

            "text": "The most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "This is largely impacted by the amount and length of PEG-lipids in LNPs. For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. [79] Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. [80] elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. [81] NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). [26,82,83] In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models. [79] In the liver, it is crucial to specifically target the cells of interest since different liver diseases involve specific liver cells, and nonspecific targeting could result in toxic accumulation and significantly lower therapeutic effect.",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of LNPs such as particle size and surface charge are critical for siRNA delivery via systemic administration. When their properties are not satisfactory for systemic drug delivery, almost all LNPs injected are captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and rapidly eliminated from the blood, resulting in poor accumulation in a target tissue [108]. To avoid such unfavorable biorecognition, the particle size of LNPs is commonly in the range of 30 to 150 nm; and the surface of LNPs is often covered with PEG. Modification of LNPs with PEG is well known to enhance their dispersibility in aqueous solution and to improve their stability in the blood. On the other hand, the presence of PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the interaction between LNPs and target cells, which reduction diminishes their internalization into the cells. Therefore, the formulation of PEGylated LNPs should be optimized for the purpose of PEGylation. The amount of a PEG-lipid conjugate for modifying the surface of LNPs strongly influences the physicochemical properties and gene-silencing efficiency of the LNPs [112,113]. It has been reported that the size of LNPs decreases as the proportion of the PEG-lipid conjugate in LNPs increases [31]. Increased PEG density on the surface of LNPs has been shown to reduce the immune response [114]. The structural differences in the length of PEG, fatty acids, and linker of the PEG-lipid conjugate used for modification of LNPs also strongly affect the potential of LNPs. LNPs modified with (R)-3-[(\u03c9-methoxy-PEG-carbamoyl)]-1,2-di-Ooctadecyl-sn-glyceride (C18) showed high blood retention but dramatically reduced gene-silencing effects in the liver [112,113]. This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes.

            "text": "A number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

            "text": "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.",

            "text": "We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. 15 olipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in the incorporation of LNPs into hepatocytes in vivo. 16 Plasma ApoE preferentially binds to PEG lipids of the LNP surface. LDLR proteins on hepatocytes recognize ApoE-LNP complexes, resulting in LNP incorporation via endocytosis. LNPs become cationic due to reduced pH during endosome maturation, leading to LNP fusion to the endosomal membrane. 17 siRNA is finally released into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing RNAi-mediated knockdown of target molecules in hepatocytes. \n\n3][24][25][26] Therefore, gene suppression in mononuclear phagocytes by LNPs may be an effective treatment strategy for such disorders. \n\nIn this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of our asymmetric ionizable lipid-based biodegradable LNPs on immune cells. LNPs were strongly incorporated into tissue-resident macrophages, including liver macrophages. Analysis of ApoE-deficient mice revealed that LNP uptake by liver macrophages is not dependent on ApoE expression. Administering LNPs encapsulating siRNA targeting interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) (siIrf5-LNPs), an essential transcription factor in triggering inflammatory responses, reduced IRF5 expression in macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, prophylactic administration of siIrf5-LNPs was effective in preventing liver damage in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. These results indicate that our biodegradable LNPs are a useful tool for analyzing macrophage function in vivo, and they can be used in novel therapies for treating inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Moreover, liver targeting can be achieved by active or passive targeting [160]. \n\nThe clinical achievement of LNPs with chemotherapeutics and nucleic acids revealed the potential of LNPs in the treatment of different types of cancer, However, the number of fruitful products reaching the market does not accurately represent the number of LNPs employed in pre-clinical trials, which indicated that the LNPs still suffers certain challenges while translating from animals to humans. Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105,161].",

            "text": "The liver tropism limitation of conventional LNPs substantially drives the development of non-hepatic organ-and specific cell type-targeted LNPs by surface engineering with various targeting ligands. Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

            "text": "After establishing LNP delivery to hepatocytes, we examined the targeted delivery of mRNA-loaded LNPs to different types of liver cells by controlling their size and PEG-lipid content. Among these cells, we focused on LSECs, where many of liver-related diseases originated. First, we hypothesized that as LSECs reside in the liver blood wall, LNPs that cannot penetrate the fenestrae will be uptaken into the LSECs. We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol. We have chosen cholesterol because, first, cholesterol has the least effect on endosomal release compared to other lipids (35). Second, cholesterol accounts for a large mole ratio among the lipid compositions, so this small change only accounts for less than 10% of the original, which will have very little impact. LNPs with mCre (0.5 mg/kg) were intravenously injected into mice. Two-days after injection, the liver was extracted and tdTomato-positive cells were confirmed by histology evaluation and flow cytometry analysis. \n\nFigure 5C and fig. S9 (A to C) show that LNPs with 68 nm (1.5% PEG-lipid) exhibited potent tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. Smaller LNPs with less than 100 nm in size could easily penetrate the fenestrae upon entering the liver blood vessel and showed maximum expression of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes at PEG-lipid content of 1.5% with 60 nm in size. However, reduced tdTomato fluorescence throughout the liver cells was observed with LNP formulations with 3% PEG-lipid. The observed phenomenon of reduced tdTomato fluorescence in higher PEG-lipid content may be attributed to the reduced ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of LNPs (36).",

            "text": "LNPs loaded with non-PEGylated mRNA formed aggregates immediately after the injection, leading to rapid clearance of the LNPs from the blood circulation. Notably, the non-PEGylated LNPs were deposited in the lung tissues, indicating the occlusion of lung capillary by the aggregates. Importantly, such lung embolism can cause the death of mice [26]. On the other hand, LNP PEGylation through PEG-OligoRNA hybridization to mRNA is effective in preventing LNP aggregation in the blood, and LNP deposition in the lung, demonstrating high structural stability of the LNPs in biological milieu and their improved safety for in vivo usage. Such structural stabilization after PEGylation may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force preventing the association of LNP with surrounding proteins, blood cells or LNPs in the blood [30]. \n\nThe mRNA introduction efficiency to the cultured cells decreased after LNP PEGylation, which may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force inhibiting the non-specific interaction of LNPs to cells and LNP uptake to the cells (Figure 7). The PEGylation of the LNPs can also induce inhibitory effect on intracellular processes, such as endosomal escape [31]. Several strategies were reported for solving these issues of PEGylation, so called \"PEG dilemma\", and facilitating cellular uptake and endosomal escape, including the installation of ligands to PEG, the optimization of surface PEG density and the selective cleavage of PEG in target tissues or cells [32][33][34][35][36]. We plan combinational use of these strategies with the mRNA PEGylation approach, to achieve efficient in vivo mRNA introduction in the future study. \n\nThe use of PEGylated lipids is an alternative strategy to prevent the aggregation after mRNA addition to LNPs, and feasibility of this strategy was well studied in LNP preparation for pDNA delivery. Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38].",

Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

            "text": "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake. [86,87] e PEG shield significantly impacts LNP uptake rates in cells and can cause substantial disparities between in vitro and in vivo results.",

            "text": "administration [54]. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that the physicochemical similarity of the commonly referred to as LNPs to VLDL and the propensity to adsorb ApoE in blood plasma, enhances the accumulation of this kind of lipid systems in the liver and the internalization into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor [81]. Although the reports identified here for active liver targeting highlight the extensive efforts and strategies employed to efficiently deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to hepatocytes, LNPs have emerged as the most advanced non-viral carriers for delivering nucleic acids to liver. However, the hepatocyte-targeting ability of LNPs relays on endogenous mechanisms, and for this reason, scarce studies involving LNPs have been identified in this systematic review, focused on active targeting. In this regard, LNPs lacking any active targeting ligand have been studied to deliver mRNA encoding \u03b1-Gal A to hepatocytes of Fabry mice and non-human primates after i.v. administration [82,83]. Despite further studies with these LNPs have not been reported up to date, initial results showed the production of functional \u03b1-Gal A in the liver, which then was secreted into the circulation. Secreted \u03b1-Gal A was taken up by distal tissues such as kidney, heart, and spleen and attenuated substrate accumulation in affected tissues. These hallmarks, while valuable for liver hepatocyte applications, severely limit the use of these LNP technologies beyond the liver. Recently, a methodology termed selective organ targeting (SORT) has been developed, which enables controllable delivery of nucleic acids to target tissues [65]. SORT LNPs involve the inclusion of SORT molecules, such as chargebased lipids, that accurately tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after i.v. administration. This strategy, added to the recognized efficacy of LNPs, represents a great advance in the development of systems targeting extrahepatic organs, and it has been included in at least two patents [84,85].",

            "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

            "text": "The default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

            "text": "The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60]. This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151]. Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59]. \n\nLocalization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128]. However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152]. ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell.",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

Thus, most of the currently existing preclinical and clinical RNA protein replacement, as well as rare disease studies, consider liver diseases or utilize the liver as a protein production factory by using classical LNP formulations of smaller diameter (<100 nm) that are naturally accumulating in hepatocytes. That the size of the LNP particle >100 nm may be a limiting factor for hepatocyte targeting, especially in humans, could be inferred from Wisse at al., who measured the sizes of fenestrae [153]. Fenestrae are the pores in liver sinusoids with the size of 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm in humans without liver pathology and with a significantly larger size in rodents: C57BL/6 mice (141 \u00b1 5.4 nm) and Sprague-Dawley rats (161 \u00b1 2.7 nm) [153]. To reach hepatocytes, LNP-mRNA must pass through the fenestrae, thus limiting the size of the LNP-mRNA to about 100 nm for hepatocyte targeting. \n\nThe localization of LNP to other organs typically requires the optimization of LNP or active targeting. The importance of LNP composition optimization in screening carried out by Sago et al. resulted in finding 7C2 and 7C3 LNPs that efficiently target endothelial cells, as previously noted [147]. Using the same screening methodology as Sago et al., Gan et al. recently tested a library of 109 LNPs composed of \"constrained phospholipids\" that contained an adamantylhydrocarbon chain [154].

            "text": "In the case of neutral LNPs, surface modification with a hydrophilic polymer is necessary to prevent aggregation. However, it is generally observed that LNPs modified with PEG-lipids containing shorter fatty acid scaffolds (i.e. dimyristoyl scaffold; PEG-DMG) dominantly accumulate in the liver, when the particles are administrated via the tail vein since the shorter PEGlipids can easily dissociate from the particles in the blood circulation [6,14,15,16]. \n\nSince a longer blood retention is a crucial driving force for delivering LNP ssPalm to an inflammatory lesion, the LNP ssPalms used in the present study were modified with PEG-lipids that contain a longer chain fatty acid (distearoyl scaffold; PEG-DSG) that would allow the particles to be retained for longer periods of time in the blood. However, the use of PEG-DSG is attended by a dilemma: PEG modification has merit in avoiding hepatic clearance and prolonging the blood circulation time of the particles, while it, in parallel, prevents the cellular uptake and endosomal escape after the cellular entry via endocytosis. Thus, the density of the PEG and the type of PEGlipid need to be optimized so as to achieve to maximize and minimize the mRNA transfection activity in the target organ (colon) and non-target organ (liver), respectively [17,18]. The LNP ssPalms were modified with PEG 5000 -DSG at levels from 1.5 to 8.0 mol% of the total lipid and transgene expression in the colon was determined. \n\nThe physicochemical properties of these PEG-modified particles are shown in Table 2. As a result, a 3 mol% modification with PEG 5000 -DSG was found to be suitable for mRNA expression in the inflammatory colon. In the case of the LNP ssPalms used in this study, the amount of the PEG-lipids grafted onto the particles had no effect on the particle size, PdI or Zeta potential. The expression of luciferase was mainly detected in colon and spleen (Fig. 3d).",

            "text": "Despite having successfully identified the top four LNP formulations using the multi-step screening platform, the mechanism still remained unclear. Therefore, we proposed the following hypotheses: enhanced liver-targeting transfection is the result of (1) the tissue-specific biodistribution of LNPs, (2) the differential cellular uptake profiles of LNPs following distribution into the local tissue, and (3) the differential endosomal escape or DNA release abilities of LNPs, even between formulations with similar biodistribution and cellular uptake levels. \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we first examined the serum stability and biodistribution of the four top-performing LNPs at 6, 12, and 24 h after i.v. injection using Cy5-labeled pDNA. For comparison, we included two LNP formulations (DI-6 and FIII-1) that were less effective but possessed similar characteristics (size and zeta potential) to the topperforming ones (Supplementary Fig. 7). As Supplementary Fig. 8 showed, there was no significant difference between top-performing LNPs and low-performing ones observed in terms of size change in serum containing PBS. IVIS imaging showed that all six selected formulations, independent of transfection performance, had similar biodistribution profiles at all time points (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 9). In all cases, ~60% of LNPs were distributed to the liver at 6 h after i.v. administration. In addition, similar uptake levels by hepatocytes were seen for all six formulations, with flow cytometry assessment indicating that the high transfection by the top formulations was not caused by differences in biodistribution nor cellular uptake level (Fig. 6b). To verify that the transfection efficiency of LNPs was not related to biodistribution, we checked the transfection efficiency of six LNPs by administering the same dose of the six LNPs via intrahepatic injection. The results in Fig. 6c and d showed that although the same dosage was delivered to the liver, the local transfection efficiency was significantly different.",

The uptake of LNPs in F4/80 low CD11b + cells, F4/80 + CD11b low cells, and B cells was less prominent (Figures 1C and S3C). To assess whether siRNAs in LNPs were incorporated into the cytoplasm of target cells, we isolated liver F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages and B cells after injection of LNPs and then observed localization of AF488-labeled siRNA using confocal microscopy. As expected, AF488-labeled siRNA was present in the cytoplasm of liver F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages, but not in B cells (Figure 1D). These results suggest that the biodegradable LNPs are efficiently incorporated into resident macrophage populations, such as liver F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages. Notably, we previously compared the uptake of our LNPs between liver macrophages and hepatocytes. The rates of LNPs incorporated by macrophages and hepatocytes were approximately 40% and 60%, respectively, 31 indicating that most LNPs are taken up by hepatocytes in the liver.",

Similar results have been shown in lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) knockout mice, a receptor for apoE that is highly expressed on hepatocytes (Akinc et al. 2010). Furthermore, the PEG-lipid content affects the degree of interaction with serum proteins and cells, as 95% of LNPs containing 0.5 mol% of diffusible PEG-lipids are taken up by the liver 15 min after administration (Chen et al. 2016). Conversely, LNPs with a PEG-lipid content of 5 mol% display increased circulation times and decreased liver uptake (Chen et al. 2016). An emerging alternative to PEGylation is polysarcosine (pSar), a water-soluble polypeptoid, which offers comparable stealth properties to PEG with lower immunogenicity. Moreover, pSar is readily biodegradable and displays a higher transfection potency than conventional PEG-based LNPs (Nogueira et al. 2020).",

            "text": "An ideal LNP system must meet multiple requirements such as particle size in the order of 80 nm, sufficient stability and penetration through the liver fenestrae, and lack of inflammatory reactions, immunogenicity, and cytotoxic effects in a host. Other biological barriers include protection by nucleases, evading the MPS, and renal glomerular filtration for effective systemic distribution. The surface engineering of LNPs offers stability and target efficiency, which in turn improves the efficacy of loaded therapeutics, i.e., siRNA. The apparent pKa value of IL in the range of ~6.4 with a neutral surface charge is desirable to avoid sequestration by MPS. Thorough investigations of the ideal (or desirable) LNP structure(s), however, remain to be fully explored in different indications. It is possible that certain LNP configurations might be more advantageous for certain indications (e.g., provide better delivery at the disease site), but this issue remains to be investigated in a systematic way. The urgency to push for clinical use sometimes de-emphasizes such explorations, limiting clinically useful LNP formulations to a handful of formulations. With an increasing understanding of the contributing properties of the LNP components, further modification of the components could be employed in order to achieve a stable formulation and effective targeting of desired organs. The better implementation of organ-specific targeting is bound to enhance the efficacy of treatment as well as reduce any possible side effects by restricting the biodistribution of the drug and carrier to the site of action. This endeavour will be especially important to expand the utility of siRNAs beyond liver diseases (all siRNA approved to date are for liver indications). \n\nFor further improvements in bioavailability, increased circulation in the blood, delivery to the target organs, the surface modification of LNPs such as PEGylation, and incorporation of surface ligands on the LNPs have been found to be effective strategies. Engineered approaches to 'shed' the incorporated targeting/functional moieties will be beneficial to enhance the therapeutic effects once the carrier reaches its destination. Improved delivery in the order of 2-to 3-folds will not possibly be beneficial for improved clinical outcomes, but a more significant improvement such as 10-fold increased delivery might be required for significant clinical effects.",

            "text": "Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38]. Moreover, mRNA-loaded LNPs have been prepared by using PEGylated lipids and organic solvents, leading to the assembly of particles with several hundred nanometer diameter and highly cationic \u03b6-potential [39]. Our strategy has potential to prepare sub-100 nm-sized LNPs with neutral surface charge, by mRNA PEGylation alone or by combination with PEGylated lipids. \n\nOur strategy can potentially be applied to polymer-based mRNA carriers, which provide promising alternatives to lipid-based carriers for targeting various tissues other than the liver and the spleen [40][41][42][43], while the liver and the spleen can be more efficiently targeted using LNPs due to their tropism to these organs. By using PEGylated mRNA, the complicated processes of PEG conjugation to polycation can be avoided. Furthermore, as is the case in LNPs, PEGylation of polyplexes is beneficial for their steric stabilization in biological milieu [35,44] and alleviation of mRNA immunogenicity [45]. \n\nIn conclusion, we developed a simple, robust and versatile procedure of mRNA-loaded LNP preparation, providing a smart solution to so far complicated procedures. The PEGylation of mRNA allowed the preparation of size-controlled LNP by mixing two aqueous solutions of mRNA and parent LNP by using pipetting. Importantly, mRNA was successfully PEGylated with minimal influence on its translational activity by hybridizing mRNA with PEGylated short RNA oligonucleotides. The PEGylated LNP thus obtained exhibited high structural stability in blood after intravenous injection, while non-PEGylated LNP rapidly aggregated in blood, presumably causing lung embolism. By providing methods for easy preparation of mRNA LNP for in vivo usage, our approach has the potential to accelerate the widespread clinical use of existing and newly developed mRNA LNP formulations.",

This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges. This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

However, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDLR activity is low and may not be sufficient to mediate the efficient hepatic entry of administered LNPs (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). Therefore, an alternative to endogenous ApoE-based targeting is highly desired. The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al. 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes. More recently, this strategy was further validated in an LDLR-deficient non-human primate (NHP) model, where LNPs modified with a rationally designed ASGPR-targeted GL6 ligand effectively delivered adenine base editing mRNA to the liver, leading to efficient base editing of the ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3) gene (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). While both ApoE-based endogenous targeting and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting enable potent LNP delivery to hepatocytes, targeted and efficient delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) remains a challenge.",

            "text": "Once inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17 Their physicochemical attributes-such as size, surface charge, and lipid composition-are key in shaping their intracellular pathways and optimizing biodistribution efficiency. 18 For example, ionizable lipids with specific acid dissociation constants (pKa) improve endosomal escape by optimizing the charge interactions within the endosome. 19 The pKa values of ionizable lipids cause them to remain neutral at physiological pH and reduce off-target effects. These lipids become positively charged in the acidic endosomal environment. 20 This protonation disrupts the endosomal membrane by inducing a phase transition from the lamellar phase to a nonlamellar inverted hexagonal phase, which releases the payload into the cytosol. 21 The proton sponge effect also further helps this process by increasing osmotic pressure and rupturing the endosome. 20 By binding to ApoE, ionizable lipids help guide LNPs to hepatocytes via LDL receptors. 22 The lipid composition can also be tailored to improve ApoE interaction and maximize uptake efficiency. 23 uch as quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) have delivered essential data on lipid-protein interactions for ApoE-mediated targeting. 24 These developments have improved our understanding of how LNP compositions influence ApoE interactions and biodistribution pathways. Developments in LNP design, e.g., using selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules, have improved tissue specificity. By modifying lipid composition, SORT molecules help target organs beyond the liver, expanding LNP-based therapies. SORT molecules are specific lipids added as a fifth component to conventional four-component LNPs. The chemical structure of these molecules determines organ specificity: ionizable lipids enhance liver targeting, anionic lipids direct LNPs to the spleen, and permanent cationic lipids with quaternary ammonium groups increase lung targeting. SORT molecules function through interaction with specific plasma proteins after PEG-lipid shedding.",

Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery.

            "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "text": "The final LNP component, the PEG-lipid, is engineered to perform two specific functions. First, PEG-lipids incorporate into the emerging nanoparticle during LNP formation. As LNP systems do not contain an aqueous core, PEG-lipids reside almost exclusively on the LNP surface, and their concentrations control particle size [146]. Both the PEG molecular weight as well as the molar percentage of PEG-lipid affect the characteristics of lipid-based particles [147][148][149]. Specifically, as the PEG-lipid is increased from 0.25 mol% to 5 mol%, a reduction in LNP size is observed from~120 nm to 25 nm, but further increases to PEG-content do not modify particle size [24,147]. Second, they improve the shelf-stability by creating a steric barrier that extends away from the surface of the LNP, thereby preventing particle aggregation and improving in vivo circulation lifetimes. However, for transfection purposes, PEG-lipids have an established inhibitory effect [150,151]. Based on the hypothesized mechanism of LNP function, the nanoparticle requires an intricate balance between stability in storage and circulation, and instability within the cell to support intracellular delivery [152]. Diffusible PEG-lipids helped stabilize particles while enabling intracellular delivery [25,151]. These lipids are composed of acyl chains that are 14-carbons in length and can dissociate rapidly from the LNP in the circulation [153]. Two hours post administration, only 20% of the injected PEG-lipid is associated with the LNP. In contrast, PEG-lipids with 18-carbon acyl chains, incorporate into the LNP and do not dissociate from the particle in the circulation. At high concentrations, these PEG-lipids can contribute to extending circulation half-life (from < 30 minutes for diffusible PEG-lipid to > 2 hours) [23,153]. However, LNPs designed to target hepatic disorders do not require a prolonged circulation lifetime due to the liver's natural ability to sequester nanoparticles. Therefore, diffusible PEG-lipids are ideal for such",

            "text": "This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure. They further showed that the apparent pKa of the ionizable lipid influences intrahepatic LNP distribution, which can be tuned by modifying the chemical structure around a tertiary amine. LNP-based siRNA therapies also show that while LNPs accumulate in the liver, gene silencing depends on factors such as dosing, lipid composition, and cell interactions. 62 For example, inefficient endosomal escape can limit delivery despite favorable biodistribution. \n\nDifferent LNP formulations show variability in functional delivery despite similar levels of biodistribution. For example, LNPs formulated with sphingomyelin or DSPC exhibited different transfection efficiencies in hepatocytes compared with other liver cells. 59 The structure of ionizable lipids, in particular the head group and tail (carbon chain) length, is an important factor driving both liver uptake and functional delivery. For example, lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA with a pKa in the range of 6.2-6.5 have been shown to be optimized for liver-specific gene silencing in hepatocytes. 12 Recent research found that biodegradable ketal-ester lipids, used as ionizable lipids, made delivery more efficient while reducing liver toxicity. Their rapid breakdown in the liver also improved safety. 63 Couture-Sen\u00e9cal et al. 64 reported how the chemical structure of ionizable lipids influences their hydrolysis rates, modifying biodegradability and liver retention. With cell-free hydrolysis assays involving lipases and base reactions, they found that lipids with sterically accessible ester bonds, e.g., LP-01 and SM-102, were rapidly hydrolyzed and cleared from the liver. In contrast, more sterically hindered lipids, e.g., DLin-MC3-DMA and ALC-0315, exhibited slower degradation, resulting in prolonged liver retention.",

This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell.

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165].

[195] reported a novel modifiable LNP platform called selective organ targeting (SORT) LNP, which adds a fifth lipid component to the established LNP formulation.SORT LNPs delivered different CRISPR cargoes, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA-sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, for efficient genome editing in the liver, lungs, and spleen after i.v.administration.Although this strategy is very promising in expanding the usefulness of LNPs, the possible reason why SORT LNPs preferentially accumulate in the liver is that they are easily opsonized and captured by the hepatocytes, partially due to ApoE binding to the LNPs in the blood steam [196].In addition, selective delivery to the lungs may result from the positive surface charge of intravascular SORT LNPs [195].Therefore, to achieve more success in other tissues, such as the brain, stealth SORT LNPs will be needed [195].This could potentially be a promising start for the application of precision LNPs to target the brain.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

By contrast, the LNP surface (i.e., lipid-water interface) is rich in helper phospholipids (e.g., 1,2distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DSPC; 10 mol%*) and lipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates (e.g., 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000, DMG-PEG2k; 1.5 mol%*). [44] We therefore hypothesized that by switching the helper phospholipid of Onpattro, from zwitterionic DSPC to its closest structural, but anionic, analog, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG), we would render a LNP surface anionic while minimally disrupting LNP global structure. An anionic surface charge would, in turn, redirect LNP targeting and functional RNA delivery from hepatocytes to the hepatic RES through exploitation of a stabilin-mediated pathway of LNP recognition and uptake in LSECs while simultaneously inhibiting hepatocyte apoE-LDLr interactions (Figure 1b,c).

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs of LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does not necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mechanism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease. \n\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1).",

Strategies for generating NPs with such attributes include cell membrane coating, protein modifications, and a nonfouling biomaterials layer. 111 However, these strategies need to be optimized so that there is no deleterious effect on cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 112,113 Another approach for the detargeting of LNPs was recently introduced by Saunders et al. where the authors developed a \"nanoprimer\" that serves as a pretreatment approach to transiently occupy liver cells, thereby facilitating the delivery of LNPs to other tissues. 114",

A schematic representation of the methodological approach, including both in vitro and in vivo experiments, is shown in Fig. 2A. The detailed compositions of these LNPs are tabulated in Table S2. The incorporation of DOTAP into the LNP formulation results in a net positive charge, whereas the inclusion of DSPG results in a net negative charge (Fig. 2B). The sizes of positivecharged LNPs slightly exceeded those of the neutrally charged LNPs, while negative-charged LNPs were comparable in size to neutral-charged counterparts (Fig. 2C). LNPs with 15% DOTAP exhibited a charge of approximately + 12.83 mV. Increasing the DOTAP content to 25% and 50% results in a correspondingly greater charge. Conversely, LNPs containing 15% DSPG showed a charge of approximately \u2212 25.3 mV, a value consistent with that of LNPs prepared with 25% DSPG (Table S2). \n\nNeutral LNPs demonstrated superior transfection efficiency compared to their counterparts mixed with DOTAP or DSPG in vitro (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, LNPs comprising 25% DOTAP exhibited superior in vitro transfection efficiency relative to those with 50% DOTAP, despite having similar particle sizes. This trend was mirrored in transfection experiments in vivo (Fig. 2E). Comprehensive luminescence images and ex vivo assessments are provided in Fig. S2A-B. Figure 2F illustrates the in vivo distribution of LNPs labeled with FRET pairs. Neutral LNPs achieved the highest luciferase expression both in situ and in the liver following intramuscular injection (Fig. 2G-H, Fig. S2C-D). Although variations in lipid composition were observed among the different nanoparticles, the in vivo distribution presented a homologous phenomenon (Fig. 2F, I). LNPs with a negative charge  exhibited an enhanced FRET ratio in situ, indicating the superior structural integrity of the nanoparticles. Meanwhile, positive-charged LNPs presented similar integrity with neutral-charged LNPs (Fig. 2I).",

            "text": "Since siRNA specifically inhibits the target protein functions via the specific cleaving of the target mRNA, it has been receiving significant attention as an anti-cancer agent. To date, there have been several successful and unique reports for treating tumors using LNPs. Before the development of LNPs (siRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles), siRNA was delivered to the target organs via systemic administration by attaching siRNA onto the particle (liposome) surface (lipoplex) [118,119]. Since the accumulation of lipoplex in a tumor relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [120,121], the surface of the lipoplex can be modified with a hydrophilic PEG polymer to increase its circulation time after intravenous injection; otherwise, the lipoplex is rapidly captured by the reticuloendothelial system. On the other hand, it was reported that LNPs without a large amount of PEG modification are highly effective for liver targeting [28,122,123]. LNPs prepared with ionizable lipids form a protein corona in the bloodstream [124]. ApoE in the protein corona is recognized by receptors such as LDLR, which are overexpressed by hepatocytes [125]. Then, the complexes are internalized into hepatocytes via the ApoE-LDLR pathway [28,122,123]. Since the formation of the protein corona in the bloodstream is important for the liver targeting of LNPs, only a small amount of PEG modification (~1% as a molar ratio) of the LNP is standard protocol in the case of liver targeting. This means that the PEG modification for liver targeting is not for obtaining long circulation of LNPs after systemic administration but for increasing their stability in the bloodstream, such as by inhibition of aggregation.\n\nIn general, ionizable lipids in LNPs are positively charged at lower pH (pH~6.0); therefore, highly hydrophobic LNPs tend to aggregate at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A small amount of PEG modification increases LNP stability in the bloodstream and may not inhibit ApoE binding in the bloodstream. For example, Huang et al. prepared polymerlipid hybrid",

            "text": "Besides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs. LNPs with DOPE preferentially accumulate in the liver, and the interaction between LNPs with DOPE and ApoE was stronger than that with DSPC [118]. Protein coronas other than ApoE can be formed by modifying the lipid chemistry of LNPs. As a result, LNPs can enter hepatocytes through other endocytosis routes besides CME. Miao et al. [107] demonstrated that by incorporating alkyne and ester groups into cKK-E12-LNPs, serum albumin gets attached LNP surface instead of ApoE surface, and LNPs entered hepatocytes through CvME and micropinocytosis. \n\nFor liver diseases, mRNA-LNPs can be delivered to hepatocytes by endogenous targeting. In a mouse model of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, Yang et al. [14] found that the ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting was not significantly affected. They synthesized LNPs containing ALC-0315, DSCP, cholesterol, and ALC-0159, and the LNPs successfully delivered HNF4A mRNA to hepatocytes through ApoE action. However, under specific pathological conditions, such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), the LDLRs almost disappeared, seriously affecting the ApoE-based endogenous targeting [119]. Therefore, active targeting strategies based on  receptor-ligand binding are equally important in hepatocyte targeting, besides passive and endogenous targeting. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is present in many hepatocyte membranes. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) can be conjugated with mRNA-LNPs to actively target hepatocytes by ASGPR binding [120]. Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92].",

Adding PEG lipids to LNPs increases circulation half-life, essential for effective in vivo delivery [288]. However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference [288]. LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors [288,289]. This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein [288,290].

            "text": "For example, Liu Shuai et al. developed a novel LNP delivery technology by removing cholesterol and phospholipids, maintaining the integrity of LNP, and conferring true targeting capabilities (Figure 3). 67 LNP is designed with a reasonable lipid structure and composition, which enables the simultaneous organtargeted accumulation and translation of mRNA. The team has fundamentally altered the conceptualization of LNP, developing 3-Comp and a conventional LNP based on a central set of biodegradable cationic lipids, thereby attaining precise targeting of the lungs and liver, respectively. In contrast to earlier LNP formulations designed to target liver cells, the customized nAcx CM lipids incorporated into typical LNPs have the potential to induce liver endothelial cell selectivity. Subsequently, the 3-Comp LNP strategy for removing cholesterol provided a solution to the significant challenge of avoiding liver accumulation and achieving true lung targeting (accumulation and translation) after systemic administration. This organ-targeting method applies to other existing ionizable cationic lipids and LNPs, thereby enriching the diversity of current LNP delivery systems and expanding their targeting possibilities. 67 The team's approach to organ-targeted delivery has demonstrated considerable promise in the development of mRNA drugs with reduced adverse effects. Meanwhile, LNP can be utilized to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components, enabling genome editing in animal models. 68 However, the stability of LNP can be affected by interactions between its components. LNP instability can be attributed to physical and chemical factors. To enhance stability and prevent physical instability, measures such as adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be taken to prevent aggregation, fusion, and content leakage in LNP. Chemical instability in LNP lipids is mainly caused by hydrolysis and oxidation. For example, DSPC and ionizable cationic lipids are highly susceptible to hydrolysis during storage, which is dependent on temperature and pH due to the presence of carboxylate bonds. 63,69 When ionizable lipids are present in LNP fractions, aldehyde impurities can be produced through oxidation and hydrolysis pathways.",

            "text": "As the largest digestive organ in the body, the liver plays a central role in metabolism, mainly performed by hepatocytes, one type of parenchymal cells, in which lesion of hepatocytes often causes serious metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease, Gilben syndrome, etc. In addition, some hepatic non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also trigger serious hepatic diseases. For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "Previously reported studies of AR siRNA utilized LNPs containing PEG-DMG, a PEG-lipid with two C 14 alkyl chains. 1 PEG-lipids are required to produce LNP systems with defined sizes 33 and to prevent aggregation of the LNP after formation. 34 As noted elsewhere, 13,14 PEG-lipids with C 14 chains rapidly dissociate from the LNP (dissociation halftimes of minutes or less) following in vivo administration and result in short circulation lifetimes, enhancing liver accumulation but reducing LNP accumulation at tumor sites. In order to improve tumor accumulation, LNP systems used in this work incorporated PEG-DSG, a lipid with C 18 alkyl chains. Previous work has shown that PEG-lipids with C 18 alkyl chains remain associated with LNP for days or longer, 14 leading to extended circulation lifetimes following i.v. administration relative to those with shorter PEG chains. 13,14,35 Consistent with these reports, 35 we found that LNP-siRNA, produced by microfluidic mixing incorporating 1.5% PEG-DSG, exhibited extended circulation properties compared to LNP with equivalent amounts of PEG-DMG. 14 ncreasing the total PEG-DSG lipid in the LNP from 2.5 to 5% resulted in a marked increase in circulation halftime from approximately 30 minutes to greater than 8 hours (Figure 5). To show that increased circulation lifetime translates to enhanced LNP accumulation in tumors, fluorescently labeled LNP-AR21-siRNA containing either 2.5 or 5 mol% PEG-DSG were prepared and administered intravenously once every day for 3 days at a dose of 10 mg siRNA/kg body weight in athymic nude mice bearing LNCaP tumors. Tumors were harvested at 4 and 24 hours following the final injection of LNP formulations, fixed in 10% formalin, cryosectioned, and analyzed for LNP accumulation by confocal microscopy. Consistent with the enhanced circulation lifetime, tumor tissues from mice treated with LNP containing 5 mol% PEG-DSG showed significantly higher accumulation of fluorescence than those from mice injected with LNP containing 2.5 mol% PEG-DSG (Figure 2b).",

Several ligands (e.g., aptamers, sugars, antibodies and antibody fragments, vitamins, and aptamers) have been coupled on the LNP surface through various approaches, including direct conjugation of targeting ligands onto preformed LNPs and postinsertion of lipid conjugated molecules onto preformed LNPs, thus enabling targeted delivery. Antibodies and their various formats have been conjugated to LNPs, and the resultant conjugates have shown successful retargeting of LNPs to multiple extrahepatic cells and tissues, including immune cells, lymph nodes, bone marrow, cancer cells, and endothelial cells (Table 3). \n\nN-Acetyl Galactosamine.

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

Due to following impressive features of ASGPRs, decorating GalNAc on nanoparticles is an alternative strategy for targeting hepatocytes [43][44][45]: 1) a specific and high (~500,000 molecules per individual cell) expression in hepatocytes, 2) a rapid (~15 min) recycling time. It has also been reported that decorating GalNAc on siRNA-loaded LNPs contributed to improving hepatocyte-specificity and reduced cationic lipid-associated hepatic toxicity which is caused by the off-target accumulation of the LNPs to LSECs and activation of the same cell type followed by neutrophil-mediated inflammation [46].\n\nMany researchers have demonstrated that both ApoE-LDLR (endogenous) and GalNAc-ASGPR (exogenous) pathway are useful for efficiently delivering RNAs to hepatocytes so far. However, little was known regarding the kinetics of the delivery process including blood clearance, hepatic accumulation and cellular uptake in hepatocytes between the endogenous and exogenous targeting mechanisms. We recently investigated this using siRNA-loaded LNPs, the surfaces of which were modified differently so as to modify the mechanism for hepatocyte targeting ( Fig. 1) [47]. The blood half-life of unmodified (bare) LNPs that target hepatocytes through the endogenous mechanism was only 1.8 min, which was much (approx. 18-fold) faster than that of GalNAc/Shielded LNPs (modified with both GalNac and PEG) that target hepatocytes though the exogenous mechanism. The bare LNPs accumulated rapidly in liver tissue within 10 min upon intravenous administration, were located in or near LSECs for approximately 10 min, and were then endocytosed 30 min after the administration. Electron microscopic observations revealed that most of the LNPs were located in the space of Disse even at early time point (3 min after administration).

            "text": "The release of nucleic acids bound to cationic lipids following LNPs entry into cells is a critical step in effective nucleic acid delivery (Figure 3b). To improve delivery efficiency, extensive research has focused on the chemical optimization of cationic lipids in LNPs [76]. These cationic lipids contain ionizable amine structures with variable charges. At low pH, the amine groups acquire a positive charge, enabling binding to negatively charged cargo while maintaining a neutral state at physiological pH to reduce toxicity. Upon endosomal acidification during cellular uptake, the amine structures regain their positive charge, facilitating cargo release. Negatively charged lipids within the cell further promote nucleic acid release by neutralizing the charge of the cationic lipid carriers and disrupting electrostatic interactions. This mechanism allows LNPs to deliver nucleic acid drugs with highly stability and efficiency in vivo, enhancing intracellular delivery [77]. Beyond amine structures, the hydrophobic lipid tails and linkers in LNPs can also be chemically modified to design new lipid-based nanocarriers. Incorporating of biodegradable linkers, branched chains, and functional groups enhances the biocompatibility, efficacy, and targeting capabilities of lipid-based carriers [78]. \n\nresulting in over 67% inhibition of tumor growth [79]. \n\nA critical advantage of LNPs is their ability to target tissues with high precision. This capability is primarily achieved by modulating lipid composition, significantly reducing the off-target effects associated with non-specific delivery methods. LNPs demonstrate particularly high accumulation efficiency in the liver, making them suitable for treating liver diseases. The efficiency, scalability, and potential for single-administration treatments position LNP-based delivery systems as promoting candidates for clinical applications [80]. Intellia Therapeutics initiated the first clinical trial using LNPs as a delivery vector for CRISPR-Cas9, targeting hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) in NTLA-2001 therapy. This therapy aims to edit the TTR gene in hepatocytes.",

While some discussion exists about the expression of CD206 on the surface of mice Kupffer cells, in our data, incorporation of mannose seemed to have little effect on the uptake of the LNPs by the Kupffer cells. These results demonstrated a highly effective targeting strategy to LSECs using mannose-incorporated LNPs. \n\nNext, we confirmed the selective targeting of siRNA-loaded LNPs with mannose to LSECs. LNPs were formulated with 1.5% PEG-lipid (with 1.0% mannose-PEG lipid) and 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid) for targeting LSECs and compared the FVIII gene silencing efficiency to that of LNPs with PEG-lipid only. As shown in Fig. 8 (A and C), similar to that of mRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. The prepared LNPs with siFVIII were injected into C57BL/6 mice at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. After 2 days of injection, blood was collected and the level of FVIII protein in serum was validated. As shown in Fig. 8B, addition of mannose-PEG lipid into LNPs with 3% total PEG-lipid content showed a more enhanced FVIII inhibition in LSECs. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose to LNPs was less significant. This could be due to high ApoE adsorption at lower PEG content that facilitated the ApoE/LDLR-mediated uptake of LNPs. In addition, we further compared the LNP uptake using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As expected, galactose-incorporated LNPs showed similar diameter of mannose-incorporated LNPs.",

            "text": "Different surface charges result in the distinction of serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs, which determines the subsequent organspecific distribution of LNPs 49 . Specifically, positively charged LNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs of mice, while near-neutral LNPs present a liver accumulation. Therefore, the manipulation of surface charge by LNP formulation emerges as a feasible way to achieve the organ-selective delivery of LNPs. The systematic-selective lipid nanoparticle (Liver-LNPs) system is a classic four-component formulation that consists of cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DSPC), poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipid), and ionizable lipids (Fig. 3b). The ionizable lipid can be converted into its quaternary ammonium salt form via a simple and effective reaction with methyl iodide to afford a cationic targeting lipid (Fig. 3a). By adding the additional permanently cationic targeting lipid and replacing DSPC with 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the Liver-LNP formulation (Fig. 3b), we successfully obtained lung-selective LNPs (Lung-LNPs), which were capable of precisely delivering mRNA to the lungs. mRNA-loaded LNPs were formed by mixing an aqueous buffer solution containing mRNA and a lipid ethanol solution at the aqueousto-ethanol ratio of 3/1, v/v. Firefly luciferase mRNA (mRNA Luci ) was encapsulated by the two organ-selective LNPs, giving Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci . Both the obtained Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci were uniformly spherical assemblies with a diameter of ~60-100 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c).",

Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands cou potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA 4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence fo the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-base therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a sho circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will im prove the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation tim is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetune by modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase th circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduce endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune r sponse [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated These results clearly show that LDV-LNPs associate with both VLA-4-positive immature and mature HSPCs resulting in higher LNP accumulation and longer retention in the bone marrow. Consequently, these findings strongly support the concept of augmented retain and improved uptake in leukemic cells including leukemic stem cells in vivo.",

            "text": "-DSPE is facilitating. While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver. Blood contains significant apoE, especially on LDLs and remanent chylomicrons which are taken up in the liver via the LDLR. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs [6,51,63], allowing the particles to adsorb apoE [34]. This allows LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver, as exploited in Onpattro \u00d2 [34] (Fig. 3C). That said, other plasma components, in addition to apoE, could potentially also facilitate uptake of LNPs in hepatocytes or any other cell type.\n\nAs discussed above, PEG desorption rate can be controlled by formulating LNPs using PEG-lipids with different acyl chain lengths [24,49,51]. Relatedly, Mui et al. [51] showed that increasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid from 1.5 to 2.5 mol% compromised transfection efficiency in hepatocytes when the PEG chain was attached to a C18 lipid tail but not a C14 lipid tail. This indicates that only a C14 lipid tail facilitates PEG-lipid desorption followed by association with apoE, thereby promoting receptor-mediated uptake in the liver, and that the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid therefore has no impact on transfection efficiency as most PEG-lipids desorb rapidly following administration. Mui et al. [51] also showed that for 1.5 mol% PEG-lipids, the in vivo transfection level was almost independent of the carbon length of the PEG-lipids. Hence, the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEG",

There are multiple ways to target liver hepatocytes. A major mechanism proposed for targeting liver hepatocytes involves the formation of a protein corona enriched in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein involved in endogenous cholesterol transport (Fig. 3b). First, solvent-exposed PEG lipid desorbs from the LNP surface, unshielding the LNP for interactions with plasma proteins 98 . ApoE is among the subset of proteins that most abundantly adsorb to the LNP surface, and it can bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) 96 that is highly expressed by hepatocytes. LNPs enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, localizing to the endosome. As the endosome acidifies, ionizable lipids in the LNP are protonated, resulting in electrostatic interactions with negatively charged endosome lipids 27 and, eventually, disrupting the endosomal bilayer 143 . An LNP pK a of around 6.4 has been determined as optimal for endosomal escape, leading to cargo release into the hepatocyte cytosol to exert its therapeutic effect 159 . Knowing this mechanism has allowed researchers to improve the efficacy of LNP delivery to the liver 159 , highlighting the importance of mechanistically studying nanoparticle targeting.\n\nOther mechanisms for targeting hepatocytes that are ApoEindependent have also been developed. For example, incorporating 'synergistic' alkyne lipids into a cKK-E12 lipopeptide-based LNP promotes the binding of serum albumin to enhance mRNA delivery to the liver 160 , demonstrating that endogenous targeting of hepatocytes is possible using multiple proteins.\n\nInstead of altering the molecular composition of an LNP to yield a specific protein corona for hepatocyte delivery (endogenous targeting), conjugating ligands",

This property aids in promoting the escape of drug-encapsulated LNPs from endosomal/lysosomal compartments [164]. Auxiliary phospholipids play a crucial role in enhancing the assembly of LNP nanostructures while ensuring structural stability. Cholesterol contributes rigidity to the molecular structure by not only augmenting LNP stability but also improving fusion capabilities with target cell membranes. PEGylated lipids facilitate the formation of a stable hydration layer on LNP surfaces, which mitigates serum protein adsorption as well as non-specific cellular uptake and immune clearance, thus extending systemic circulation time for LNPs (Figure 6) [165]. Research efforts aimed at optimizing LNP functionality primarily focus on achieving targeted delivery beyond hepatic tissues. Currently, available clinically developed LNP formulations inherently exhibit spontaneous targeting towards liver tissues via apolipoprotein-mediated adsorption within the plasma, which is a limitation that significantly constrains their therapeutic application across various diseases. Qiang Cheng et al. introduced selective organ targeting (SORT) technology by incorporating charge-regulating lipid components into LNP formulations, enabling efficient lung-and spleen-targeted delivery outcomes (Figure 7A) [166]. As illustrated in Figure 7B,C, SORT LNPs contributed to high transfection in targeting organs, which suggested extensive prospects in clinical application and gene drug development.

Most strikingly, srLNPs yielded an approximately fivefold and an approximately threefold targeting enhancement to murine LSECs and KCs, respectively (Figure 6d). This confirmed that the incorporation of anionic DSPG into LNP-mRNA delivery systems not only enhanced liver tropism in general but led to a significant shift toward preferential LNP targeting and cellular uptake within hepatic RES cell types.\n\nTo confirm functional mRNA delivery to hepatic RES cells, LNPs entrapping capped mCherry-mRNA (0.25 mg kg \u22121 mRNA) were administered (Figure 6e). This dosage is in line with other systemically administered LNP-mRNA therapies, including those currently in clinical trials (e.g., NCT03829384). [85] Following organ isolation and cell separation at 24 hpi, srLNPs yielded significantly enhanced mRNA delivery to hepatic RES cell types relative to DSPC-LNPs (p < 0.001) (Figure 6f,g). Indeed, DSPC-LNP-mediated mCherry expression in hepatic RES cell types was indiscernible above background. Within hepatocytes, and despite comparatively low targeting efficiency to these cells, both srLNPs and DSPC-LNPs expressed significantly higher amounts of mCherry than in hepatic RES cells (Figure 6f). This apparent disparity between liver-cell-specific targeting and resultant mRNA expression levels can be explained by the very different physiologies and endogenous functions of hepatocytes versus hepatic RES cells. LSECs and KCs have very high endo-/phagocytic capacity (leading to significant mRNA degradation despite high LNP uptake), whereas hepatocytes have exceptionally high translational capacity (leading to significant mRNA expression despite comparably low LNP recognition and uptake).

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the lack of efficiency of the liposomes may have lied in the fact that in our studies each animal received ~9 \u00d7 10 12 DMG-LNPs or DSG-LNPs, suggesting that we dosed above the recently suggested 10 12 particles threshold for enhanced tumor accumulation (Ouyang et al., 2020). We speculate that the above-threshold LNP dose used in these experiments might have masked the potential effects of RES blockade, as the high LNP dose itself already might lead to enhanced circulation times and tumor accumulation of the particles. This hypothesis reinforces the earlier explanation regarding the varying protein corona profiles of different nanoparticles. It suggests that when injecting above the 10 12 nanoparticle threshold, the particles with the same protein corona may be blocking the RES clearance of surplus particles, thereby enhancing their tumor accumulation. \n\nIn an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of our in vivo results, we also conducted in vitro experiments using mouse hepatocyte and macrophage cell lines to examine how liposomes affect the cellular uptake of siRNA-LNPs. Unexpectedly, pre-treatment with the in vivo tested liposomes led to enhanced macrophage LNP uptake (Fig. 4a,b). We hypothesize that this increased uptake might result from the fact that preincubation with liposomal particles activates the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, thereby enhancing LNP uptake. Previous reports have described how liposomal cholesterol can act as an enhancer of phagocytic capacity of macrophages (Ghosh et al., 2014). Interestingly, LNP uptake in hepatocyte-derived cells was not clearly reduced after liposome pre-treatment, particularly for MC3-LNPs. These results could explain why we did not observe a decrease in LNP liver accumulation or enhanced circulation time and tumor accumulation when pre-treating the animals with liposomes in our in vivo experiments. Alternatively, the liposomes present in circulation at the time of LNP administration may contribute to LNP destabilization, thereby reducing their circulation time.",

LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery.

            "text": "In contrast, AA2-DD-3 and AA2-TD-3, with C7 and C9 side chains, showed enhanced delivery to the liver, accompanied by a decrease in delivery to other organs (Figure 5B). Overall, mRNA delivery to the liver of AA2-DD-3 was significantly less efficient (2.4-fold) compared to liver-targeting MC3 LNPs and could be further reduced by 3.5-fold by fine-tuning the side chain composition, as demonstrated with AA2-DL-3 (Figure 5B). This emphasizes the potential to develop APEs as an mRNA delivery platform to nonliver tissues. Liver targeting could potentially be further reduced by excluding cholesterol from APE-LNP formulations due to their low reliance on this excipient for mRNA delivery, as shown in vitro (Figure 4B). This strategy was recently employed by Su et al., to decrease liver accumulation for LNPs containing permanently charged lipids. 52 Based on our findings, we also investigated if the 4C side chain can improve mRNA delivery of the previously reported lung-targeting AA3-DD-3 LNP with a 7C side chain and found that reducing side chain length resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in mRNA delivery to the lungs (Figure S13). This reinforces the importance of optimizing the side chain composition to improve the in vivo performance of APE-LNPs. 25 Optimizing the hydrophobicity of polyesters by Yu et al. led to enhanced performance of mRNA polyplexes in the lungs, suggesting the contribution of polymer hydrophobic domains in interactions with serum or cell components, although the mechanism remains unclear. 53 Notably, the effect of changes in hydrophobicity on the ability of LNPs to target specific organs may differ between biomaterials. Liu et al. reported that multitailed ionizable phospholipids (iPhos) with short alkyl tails predominantly targeted the liver, while long tails preferentially targeted the spleen. 54 o gain further insights into the differences in mRNA delivery to different organs, we studied the biodistribution of APE-LNPs labeled with the fluorescent dye DiR.",

            "text": "And changing formulation to lyophilized form or adding cryoprotectant, such as mannitol and sucrose, are feasible methods to improve the stability of LNP formulations [61]. \n\nDespite some studies show that lipid materials may cause liver or lung injuries and the cytotoxicity of LNPs is related to the dosage of administration and the properties of lipids used, LNPs offer several advantages compared to viral vectors, including ease of production, relatively low immunogenicity, high RNA loading capacity, and flexible design options [61,62]. Most LNPs are prone to target liver and usually be utilized to treat liver diseases. For instance, Onpattro with DLin-MC3-DMA LNP as the vector, is administrated intravenously and enables the inhibition of hepatic production of transthyretin [63]. Yang et al. demonstrated that LNPs encapsulating HNF4A mRNA could attenuate liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse model [64]. Finn et al. used a degradable lipid to formulate LNPs to deliver Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA for gene editing in vivo. The results showed that the editing efficiency was highly considerable for transthyretin gene editing in the liver, reducing serum protein levels by over 97% with a single dose [65]. Recently, some studies have revealed the rules of LNP targeting different liver cell subsets. It is reported that altering surface charge on the LNP in Onpattro formulation from neutral to anionic, the vector was prone to deliver mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system [66]. Additionally, researchers discovered that altering the size, adjusting PEG-lipid content, or incorporating ligands in LNPs affected the distribution of loaded cargoes in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), or increased the delivery efficiency in extrahepatic organ. For instance, LNPs with 100 nm diameter in size are the most effective for targeting LSECs, while LNPs with smaller diameters, such as 60 nm, showed tropism for hepatocytes [67].",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous admin istration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutane ous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs o LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does no necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mech anism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosa mine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte tar geting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepato cytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "Many diseases can affect the liver. Among them, tyrosinemia [104,105] and autoimmune hepatitis [106] are very severe diseases. Fortunately, LNP delivery to the liver is very effective. It is enhanced by the biological effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [107,108]. After LNPs are injected intravenously, ApoE forms a corona around the particles. Since ApoE binds specifically to receptors on hepatocytes, it directs LNPs towards the liver. This explains why LNPs are more easily trapped by the liver [108]. In addition, the liver can be used as a protein factory [109] to treat various rare diseases through gene therapy. As the liver is an excellent therapeutic target, it is important to optimize delivery to this organ. \n\nPatisiran (ONPATTRO\u2122) is the first RNA drug delivered by LNPs that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [107]. This LNP is composed of DLin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/cholesterol/DMG-PEG at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 [110]. As it was the first to be approved, this formulation inspired the composition of other LNPs. Table 4 presents some formulations that target the liver. \n\nLiu et al. [22] obtained impressive results. When delivering LNPs with Cas9 mRNA, along with a sgRNA targeting PCSK9, they succeeded in reducing the serum PCSK9 by 80%. They used the following formulation: BAMEA-16B/DOPE/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG (16/4/8/1 w:w). They used a lipid:mRNA ratio of 15:1 (w:w). Their LNP had a size of 230 nm. Fortunately, they observed no signs of inflammation and no obvious hepatocellular injury. Rothgangl et al. [113] have obtained important results.",

The CL4H6 lipid contains two very long hexyl oleate chains (C24 + O1) ( Fig. 2A). The CL4H6-LNPs exhibited an ED 50 of 0.0025 mg/kg in a mouse F7 model. We found that 4.2% of the siRNA was loaded in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) at 24 h after intravenous administration, suggesting that endosomal escape was better compared to MC3. The CL4H6 also exhibited a better tolerability compared to MC3-LNPs due to the fact that the CL4H6 is biodegradable. It is known that phosphocholine (PC)-containing neutral lipids, including phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins (SMs), are cylindrical-shaped and therefore stabilize bilayers and strongly inhibit membrane fusion [52,57]. We revealed that the long hexyl oleate scaffolds can overcome the inhibitory effect of PC-containing neutral lipids on the fusogenicity of the LNPs",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have delivered RNA therapies to hepatocytes in patients after intravenous administration (1)(2)(3). As a result, there is an interest in delivery to nonliver tissues (4), which is often accomplished using three approaches. The first is to inhibit the uptake of LNPs or the subsequent activity of the therapeutic payload in the liver (5,6). The second is to add active targeting ligands including antibodies or small molecules onto LNPs to redirect them from hepatocytes (7)(8)(9)(10)(11). Finally, the third is to modify the chemical composition of the LNP, thereby driving endogenous trafficking (12) away from hepatocytes. This can be accomplished by engineering the ionizable lipid (13)(14)(15) or adding a charged helper lipid, which can increase the nonliver:liver tropism (16)(17)(18)(19)(20). In one example, scientists found that RNA-lipoplexes were targeted to the lung or lymphoid tissues by adding positive or negative charge, respectively (16). In another, replacing the zwitterionic phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine with the cationic helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) redirected LNPs from the liver to the lung (17). Additional observations, including that LNPs formulated with a fifth cationic component can be redirected to the lung, were subsequently reported (18)(19)(20). Given the consistency of reports showing increased lung:liver delivery after adding a cationic helper lipid, one reasonable hypothesis is that charge-dependent tropism is universal and therefore any positively charged component should increase lung delivery while decreasing liver delivery.",

In particular, LNPs with sizes of 45 to 80 nm showed significant silencing in hepatocytes. To figure out which types of liver cells were mostly interacting with the formulated LNPs, we prepared Cre mRNA (mCre)-loaded LNPs with their size under 100 nm. mCre was formulated into LNPs, and mCre dose of 0.5 mg/kg was injected into mice carrying a loxP-flanked stop cassette. Once a stop cassette is deleted, mice can express robust tdTomato fluorescence. Therefore, delivery of functional mCre allows the facile identification of cells transfected with formulated LNPs. As shown in Fig. 4A, robust tdTomato fluorescence was detected exclusively in the liver. To further confirm the cell type-specific gene edition in the liver, we extracted a mouse liver 2 days after injection and evaluated tdTomato fluorescence by the histology observation of liver tissue. Compared to phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)-injected mice, strong tdTomato fluorescence was detected in hepatocytes (Fig. 4B). To further examine transfection efficiency in different types of liver cells, we labeled hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells with specific antibodies. Then, tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were evaluated by histological analysis using the MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 4C, 80% of hepatocytes, 40% of endothelial cells, and 10% of Kupffer cells exhibited the positive results of tdTomato fluorescence. In addition to the histological evaluation, tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9B). Transfection efficiency in hepatocytes was the highest among different types of liver cells.",

LNPs allow for efficient cargo delivery to hepatocytes in vivo. 19,28,29 Through structure-based rational design and targeted screening in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, we have developed LNP-based formulations for safe and effective in vivo delivery of our modified mRNA constructs. 21 To assess whether functional hABCB4 could be re-expressed in vivo, we administered a single i.v. injection of LNP-encapsulated hABCB4 v6 mRNA (or eGFP-encoding control mRNA, Ctrl) into mice bearing a homozygous disruption of endogenous Abcb4 gene (i.e. BALB/ c.Abcb4 \u2212/\u2212 mice) and measured hepatic protein expression and biliary PC secretion. Mice were euthanised at 12 h post-injection and hABCB4 protein levels in enriched liver membrane preparations were determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of human ABCB4 protein was readily detected in the livers of BALB/c.Abcb4 \u2212/\u2212 mice at 12 h after i.v. injection of LNP-formulated hABCB4 v6 (hABCB4 v6 -LNP). As expected, 5 BALB/c.Abcb4 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited absence of PC in their bile (PC concentration of <1% of WT littermates' levels). In contrast to an almost complete absence of PC (as represented by a PC species of 34:2) in bile of control BALB/c.Abcb4 \u2212/\u2212 mice administered with either PBS or eGFP-encoding mRNA, a single injection of the hABCB4 v6 -LNP resulted in a robust increase in bile PC at ~25% of normal (WT) level at 12 h post-injection (Fig. 2B). Importantly, similar increases in biliary PC were achieved in both sexes, along with expected improvement of other biliary physiology parameters such as biliary cholesterol secretion (Fig. S4 and Table S5).",

            "text": "As in hepatic targets, there are no direct carrier (ApoE) mediated targeting avenues for extra-hepatic targets. Several approaches, therefore, have been employed for non-hepatic targets. In this regard, selective organ targeting (SORT) has been explored by Dillard and coworkers [59], where a fifth component (or SORT molecule), in addition to the conventional four-lipid composition of LNPs, enables extrahepatic targeting of LNPs. The authors hypothesized that after desorption of PEG lipids on the LNP surface, the underlying SORT molecules are exposed and recognized by distinct serum proteins. These serum proteins then adsorb onto the LNP surface and lead the LNPs to the targeted organ by interacting with cognate receptors expressed by cells in the target organs, akin to the ApoE-based LNP accumulation in the liver. The group successfully demonstrated liver, spleen, and lung delivery, and has shown potential for other important delivery targets. The SORT molecule library also consists of lipids of diverse pKas. It was determined that 6-7 pKa lipids are best suited to liver targeting, greater than 9 pKa lipids are ideal for lung targeting, and 2-6 pKa lipids are best suited to spleen targeting [59]. \n\nMeyer et al. [60] have also thoroughly reviewed extrahepatic targeting for mRNA delivery, which was found be in concurrence with the SORT approach, where positively charged lipids and negatively charged LNPs were found to preferentially accumulate in the lungs and spleen, respectively. Additionally, poly-beta amino ester (PBAE) polymer [61,62], 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA) lipid, 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipid [63], and polyacrylic acid (PAA) polymers [64] were found to target the lungs by altering the PEG lipid, helper lipid, and N/P ratio.",

During the LNP formulation process, the four lipids can be altered or added to other components, and the composition ratio of each lipid can be modified. Even a slight difference can change the properties of an LNP. For example, changing the molar ratio of PEG or changing the formulation rate changes the size of the LNP in the formulation 11,[75][76][77] . The charge of the LNP is altered by or adding to a charged lipid 78,79 . Moreover, there are techniques for altering PEG lipids 80,81 . \n\nModifying the size of LNPs Hideyoshi Harashima's research team conducted a study on targeting the lymph node, a key organ that can control the immune response, by adjusting the size of LNPs 82 . The LN is an organ where immune cells assemble, and it can function as a bridge between innate immunity and adaptive immunity 83 . This study team examined whether the LN could be effectively targeted through the subcutaneous injection of LNPs in mice after modulating the LNP size by altering the PEG component ratio of the LNP. The LNP with a low PEG ratio was 200 nm in size, and the LNP with a high PEG ratio was 30 nm in size. As a result, the 30 nm LNP targeted the LN much more accurately than the LNPs of other sizes (100 and 200 nm). \n\nIn another study, the size of the LNP was changed by changing the ethanol content, total flow rate during mixing, hold time, and dilution factor in dextrose 5% in water 77 . IgG titers were compared after secondary intramuscular injection into mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with LNPs of various sizes encapsulated with mRNA encoding the cytomegalovirus pentamer and glycoprotein gB. In mice, the IgG titer improved as the size approached 100 nm and declined as the size increased. The trend of antibody production capacity according to LNP size, however, was not verified in NHPs.",

            "text": "Key examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

            "text": "Liver hepatocytes are an attractive cellular target for delivery owing to their metabolic and secretory functions. A great many genetic disorders affect hepatocytes, most of which cannot be treated using conventional small-molecule drugs. Thus, the use of nanoparticles to deliver nucleic acid therapeutics and gene-editing systems has emerged to meet this clinical need 146 . Alternatively, researchers have sought to leverage the physiological role of the liver in secretion of molecules into the systemic circulation, treating hepatocytes as an endogenous bioreactor for producing therapeutic biomolecules.\n\nLNPs are the most advanced delivery system for targeting hepatocytes. Most notably, the first siRNA drug approved by the FDA, Onpattro, utilizes a four-component LNP carrier composed of an ionizable amino lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000, to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 73 . The successful clinical translation of Onpattro and of the two LNP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 2,3 has established that LNPs are a safe, efficacious and scalable technology platform, laying a firm foundation that can ease the translation of other LNP-based therapeutics. Because of the extensive experience and varied applications of LNPs as delivery systems to liver hepatocytes, the remainder of this section focuses on LNPs.\n\nLNPs are now being utilized as delivery systems in a diverse array of preclinical and clinical studies of nucleic acid therapeutics to hepatocytes. Many of these studies focus on mRNA delivery in several clinical contexts including protein replacement therapy, such as in clotting disorders [147][148][149] or in-born errors of metabolism 35,[150][151][152][153][154][155][156] , in situ gene editing 49,157 and systemic secretion of monoclonal antibodies against infectious diseases or cancer 69,",

Stimulated by our work on charge unbalanced lipids with multi-organ tropism, 14 demonstration that surface charge-adjusted mRNA lipoplexes could promote delivery to dendritic cells 15 of the immune mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) system, 16,17 and other reports on non-selective delivery, [18][19][20][21][22] we speculated that internal and/or external charge may be a key factor for tuning tissue tropism. 23,24  n this paper, we therefore studied if one could augment established LNP molar compositions with supplemental molecules to tune the internal charge, thereby altering cell fate in vivo. Indeed, intravenous administration of the developed SORT LNPs enabled high levels of mRNA delivery and tissue-specific gene editing. \n\nSORT is compatible with various methods of deploying gene editing machinery, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA / sgRNA, and Cas9 RNPs. Lung, spleen, and liver enhanced SORT LNP delivery of Cre mRNA to tdTom mice, resulting in organ selective transfection of 40% of epithelial cells and 65% of endothelial cells; 12% of B cells and 10% of T cells; and 93% of hepatocytes, respectively. Lung, spleen, and liver SORT LNP delivered mRNAs to produce therapeutically relevant levels of proteins including IL-10, EPO, and Klotho. In addition, co-delivery of Cas9 mRNA and sgPCSK9 by liver SORT LNPs enabled complete ~100% knockout of serum and protein levels of PCSK9, a therapeutically attractive target for treatment of cardiovascular disease. 25",

            "text": "Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose. In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "This LNP selectively adsorbs plasma proteins following intravenous injection and specifically edits liver macrophages to enhance phagocytosis and initiate immune responses within tumors, thereby effectively halting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [131]. As a pivotal nanocarrier system, LNPs offer numerous advantages, including a simple structure, versatile compositions, and notable benefits [132][133][134][135]. The efficiency of drug loading and targeted release is influenced by the adjustment of lipid composition and structure, which enhances drug bioavailability and efficacy. LNPs also exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, rarely causing immune or toxic reactions. Despite the widespread use of LNPs in drug delivery, especially in gene therapy and vaccine development, their immunogenicity remains a concern. LNP formulations, particularly those used for mRNA vaccines, have been shown to trigger inflammatory responses. These immune responses can vary based on the composition of the lipids, with some ionizable lipids being more immunogenic than others [136]. Modifying lipid structures or incorporating additional excipients to reduce immunogenicity is an ongoing area of research aimed at improving the clinical safety profile of LNP-based therapies [137]. Targeting can be improved by modifying surfactants or lipid molecules, reducing drug toxicity to normal tissues, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. The size, shape, and surface properties of LNPs can be precisely tailored to meet various drug requirements through adjustments in formulation and processing conditions. Recent advancements in LNP technology have focused on the development of new lipid materials to enhance stability and functionality. For instance, the incorporation of ionizable lipids in LNPs has dramatically improved the efficiency of nucleic acid delivery by facilitating endosomal escape. Additionally, functionalizing the LNP surface with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, enables precise targeting of specific cell types, further enhancing therapeutic potential. PEGylation (the attachment of polyethylene glycol chains) is another widely used strategy to extend the circulation time of LNPs in vivo by reducing their recognition by the immune system [138].",

            "text": "Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property. The length of the acyl chain of PEG also regulates the intracellular delivery of a drug into the target cell. Usually, to the membrane of LNPs, the PEG-lipid is anchored using the hydrophobic acyl chain [62]. PEG-lipids having short acyl chains dissociate quickly from the LNPs following injection (since less energy is required in order to break the anchoring bonds present between the PEG-lipid and LNP), allowing the LNPs to better interact with target cells. For instance, PEG-lipids with C14 acyl chains take a half-time of around 1 h to dissociate from LNPs, while PEG-lipids with C20 acyl chains take 24 h or longer half-times for dissociation. PEG shields the LNP from the serum protein such as apolipoproteins (ApoE) and albumins. Judge et al. revealed that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids, showed longer circulation time and thereby enhanced the efficacy LNPs as compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids. The reduced association of ApoE was observed due to the highly shielded LNPs provided by mPEG200. [71]. This resulted in longer circulation which led to a greater opportunity of LNPs to enter subcutaneous tumour cells [72]. However, an excessive amount of PEGylation in LNP could inhibit cellular internalization and intracellular release of the drug, resulting in reduced intracellular delivery [73]. \n\nSuzuki et al. also studied the PEG shedding profiles of DMG-LNP and DSG-LNP, respectively for encapsulation of siRNA specific for GFP or FVII. DMG-PEG with shorter acyl chains displayed faster shedding from the LNPs than the DSG-PEG having the longer acyl chain.",

Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

            "text": "Currently, the next breakthrough in the field of LNP is the ability to divert the nucleic acid payload away from the liver and allow access to extra-hepatic sites that would enable treatment of any genetic diseases from cancer to Alzheimer's. The major issue to be addressed is the propensity of LNP accumulating in the liver upon systemic administration [59,60]. The current gold standard LNP based on DLinMC3DMA and ALC-0315 are lipids known to associate with ApoE, which are readily taken up by the liver. In order to escape the liver, the strategy whereby increasing PEG-lipid content to prevent the ApoE binding and deviate the endogenous targeting away from the liver has shown limited success in prolonging circulation and redistributing the LNP to extrahepatic sites [59,60]. A potential strategy is to use a targeting ligand to facilitate the uptake of LNP to specific organs [162,163]. Studies led by the Muzykantov laboratory have demonstrated the successful conjugation of antibodies targeting vascular adhesion molecule PECAM-1 or ICAM-1 and re-directing the LNP accumulation away from the liver to the lung [164,165] or VCAM-1 and targeting to the cerebral endothelium during brain edema [165]. A similar approach, using CD-4 antibody conjugated to the surface of the LNP, directed uptake into all T cells (na\u00efve, central, memory, and effector) in both spleen and lymph enabling the possibility to conduct chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in vivo [166]. Targeting ligands can re-distribute the LNP to extrahepatic sites; however, these examples are only demonstrated in small research scale settings. The current commercial manufacturing of mRNA-LNP is dependent on multiple steps that are not necessarily amenable to adding the targeting aspect. To ensure the manufacturing success of targeting LNP, two processes must be optimized: large scale production of the ligand, often a biological drug substance that is difficult and costly to manufacture, and the conjugation step to couple the ligand to the LNP.",

            "text": "As stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid. For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

            "text": "Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92]. Specifically, in the endogenous targeting pathway, LNPs rapidly enter the Disse space from the blood and gradually accumulate, then being slowly absorbed by the cells. In contrast, in the active targeting pathway, LNPs exhibit slower and more sustained cellular uptake, remaining in the blood for a longer period. Although active targeting can enhance the specificity of the mRNA-LNPs by incorporating additional targeting ligands, its implementation for hepatocyte targeting is less common due to increased formulation complexity. Currently, liver-specific delivery research predominantly employs passive and endogenous targeting. \n\nBesides hepatocytes, other cells also play important roles in liver diseases and can serve as the target cells of mRNA NPs [121]. For example, HSCs are important effector cells in liver fibrosis [122], while liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are significant in immunotherapy and a proposed target for immunomodulation [113,123]. \n\nHowever, HSCs are difficult to transfect, and the complexity of the liver microenvironment during liver fibrosis further compounds the difficulty of targeting HSCs. To address these challenges, Younis et al. designed a ligand-free mRNA-LNP containing CL15A6 lipid of hydrophobic scaffold structure (Fig. 7B) [108]. This formulation achieved successful transfection of over 80% of HSCs in vivo in liver fibrosis mice. The CL15A6-LNP had a diameter of approximately 80 nm, allowing it to pass through the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium. Additionally, the LNP pKa was about 7.25, which made LNPs unrecognizable by ApoE, thus avoiding substantial interactions with hepatocytes. Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME.",

Once in systemic circulation, ApoE binds to LNPs, which leads to their accumulation in hepatocytes and internalization via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in hepatocytes. Figure 5 illustrates the ApoE-mediated hepatic uptake of LNPs. Such ApoE-based uptake has been confirmed by the difference in LNP uptake in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice [56,57]. Another parallel route for the uptake of LNPs is the clathrin-dependent endocytosis mechanism of LNPs [58]. The endocytosis route has been exploited by interactions based on electrostatic charge that have the potential to enhance cellular uptake. Such charge-based approaches are described subsequently in this article.",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

            "text": "RNA interference represents a highly attractive alternative to current treatment regimens, however, extrahepatic delivery of siRNA using LNPs has proven difficult due to high liver accumulation. Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands could potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA-4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake of LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence for the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-based therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a short circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will improve the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation time is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetuned modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase the circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduced endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune response [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated in LNPs for in vivo usage. As an alternative, PEG could be replaced with polysaccharides, naturally occurring membrane lipids, or stealth-providing compounds such as polysarcosine to shield the nanoparticle from rapid removal by opsonization [52][53][54][55][56]. Additionally, an attractive concept is passive targeting by changing the lipid formulation, however, little is known about the optimal lipid composition for bone marrow targeting [57][58][59]. For liposomes, it is reported that cholesterol aids in bone marrow uptake by phagocytic cells via selective opsonization such as C3 complement protein-an interesting point for future studies on targeting the bone marrow with LNPs [60,61].",

            "text": "LNPs principally contain an ionizable lipid that not only drives RNA encapsulation through their pH driven ability to form ion-pair interactions with the anionic phosphate backbone of RNA, but also aids in triggering endosomal escape through membrane destabilization (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Semple et al., 2010;Viger-Gravel et al., 2018;Lechanteur et al., 2018;Zelphati and Szoka, 1996;Sabnis et al., 2018). Other typical constituents of LNPs are a phospholipid and cholesterol to maintain structural integrity, and an outer polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid to coat the LNP (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Leung et al., 2012;Crawford et al., 2011). This outer decoration protects LNPs from the host immune response, imparts serum stability and is cleavable once inside the target cell (Fig. 1 A). Typically, the ionizable lipids used in LNP formulations are neutral at physiological pH, and hence they possess the characteristics of a neutral liposome. Neutral liposomes of < 100 nm hydrodynamic size have an overwhelming bias towards hepatocytes. Previously, Yan et al. have demonstrated the plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent enhanced plasma clearance of neutral liposomes by measuring a 3.6-fold faster rate of clearance vis-\u00e0-vis negatively charged liposomes in wild type mice versus ApoE deficient mice (Yan et al., 2005). This was further supported by Akinc et al. (Akinc et al., 2010) by showing the enhanced liver uptake of ionizable LNP (iLNP) compared to cationic LNP (cLNP) in the presence of ApoE. This necessitates alternative strategies for extrahepatic delivery of LNPs. In this regard, lung and lung airway is an organ of great therapeutic relevance that can be targeted by LNPs.",

This paradigm shift is exemplified by the finding that cholesterol removal can address the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues, which can be explained by tuning the affinity to reduced lipoprotein adsorption 88 . By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNPs components, researchers have achieved concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation in targeted organs like the lung and liver. This innovative targeting strategy shows promise for enhancing the precision of mRNA therapies across diverse diseases and may apply to existing LBNPs systems. However, it is important to note that the optimal LNPs formulation likely depends on the specific therapeutic target and delivery requirements, and traditional components may still play crucial roles in various applications.

            "text": "Intracellular dynamics of LNPs is one of great concern to improve the efficiency of siRNA delivery. When LNPs that encapsulate siRNA are taken up into cells by endocytosis, they are sent to late endosomes followed by lysosomes and then degraded [105]. For this reason, LNPs should have a function for endosomal escape and for release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm [24]. The pKa of the ionizable lipid is an important parameter that strongly affects the efficiency of siRNA delivery [26]. The optimal pKa range for gene silencing in hepatocytes has been shown to be 6.2-6.5, suggesting that cationization of ionizable lipids in the weakly acidic environment of the endosome is critical for efficient siRNA delivery. The neutral surface charge of LNPs reduces nonspecific adsorption of serum proteins in the blood to the LNP surface compared with a cationic surface charge [25,106,107]. Such adsorption causes phagocytosis of LNPs in the blood and the liver [108], resulting in a reduced efficiency of delivery to target tissues. After LNPs are taken up into cells by endocytosis, their surface charge changes from neutral to positive at the low endosomal pH, which change enhances the interaction of the positively charged LNPs with the negatively charged endosomal inner membrane. This electrostatic interaction induces membrane fusion via the hexagonal II structure, allowing the release of the encapsulated siRNA into the cytoplasm [15,25]. In addition to the pKa of the ionizable lipid, the lipid composition of LNPs and the molar ratio of siRNA and lipids in LNPs affects the efficiency of siRNA delivery [25,26,31]. The design of an appropriate formulation of LNPs must be required to capture siRNA in LNPs and induce efficient endosomal escape of LNPs [109].",

Whether the biodistribution of LNPs without active-targeting ligands is associated with passive targeting is hard to determine, as Onpattro \u00d2 shows that active targeting via apoE can be achieved by controlling the interaction between LNPs and proteins in blood.\n\nIn the fast-growing field of cancer immunotherapy, the focus is on modifying and activating immune cells. A recent study [117] showed that conjugating CD4 antibody to LNPs enables specific targeting to and mRNA interventions in CD4 + cells, including T cells. After systemic injection in mice, CD4-targeted radiolabeled mRNA-LNPs accumulated in spleen, providing $ 30-fold higher signal from reporter mRNA in splenic T cells, as compared with nontargeted mRNA-LNPs. Another recent study specifically targeted gut-homing leukocytes in experimental colitis. To do this, they fused two integrin-binding domains of MAdCAM-1, the natural ligand of a4b7 integrin, to an IgG-Fc and devised a strategy to efficiently conjugate this fusion protein to the LNP surface [118].\n\nThe current LNP-based clinical trials, including the approved LNP products, illustrate both the general challenges related to targeting LNPs beyond the liver and the lack of effective targeting strategies (Fig. 7A). Searching https://www.clinicaltrials.gov for ''lipid nanoparticle\" shows, after filtering, 14 LNP hits. Since not all LNP-based clinical trials include information on the LNPs, some trials do not appear in this search. Additional LNP-based clinical trials were therefore identified from Moderna, BioNTech, and Cur-eVac pipelines as well as current literature [14,114]. These searches identified a total of 40 LNP clinical trials. Of these 40 clinical trials, 22 used local injection, including i.m. for vaccines and intratumoral for cancer.

            "text": "We observed maximal protein expression in the liver, followed by the spleen. To identify protein expressing cells within the liver, we used loxP-flanked tdTomato reporter mice 20 , which express tdTomato upon delivery of Cre-recombinase mRNA (Cre mRNA). Mice were injected with Cre mRNA encapsulated in cKK-E12 LNPs or Syn-3 LNPs. We found that both hepatocytes and major non-parenchymal cells (i.e., macrophages, endothelial cells) expressed tdTomato, with parenchymal hepatocytes representing ~80% of tdTomato positive cells. The percentage of hepatocytes expressing tdTomato increased from 53.4 to 73.4% when A6 was included in the LNP formulation (Supplementary Fig. 4). As hepatocytes are a major target for mRNA expression, we used primary hepatocytes to evaluate the behavior of LNPs in vitro. Interestingly, we found that the addition of serum protein to the culture medium (to mimic physiological conditions) significantly improved the delivery of mRNA using cKK-E12 containing LNPs to primary hepatocytes at two different cholesterol % formulations (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that serum factors or proteins play a role in the delivery of mRNA to the liver. \n\nAlbumin is the major protein in the synergistic LNPs corona. Serum proteins are the major biological component of the corona coating formed on NPs following exposure to biological fluids 21 . Formation of a protein corona on our LNPs was confirmed using The optimal ratio of cKK-E12:A6 in the LNP formulation was also evaluated using hEPO mRNA. The optimal ratio was also found to be 7:3. i, j Dose-dependent and time-dependent protein expression using Syn-3 (cKK-E12:A6 is 7:3) LNPs was compared with cKK-E12 LNPs, and demonstrated superior gene expression in vivo.

Nonetheless, minimal alteration of chemical structures of vectors in the same class might also achieve the goal of targeting, and the research on exploring targeted material structures is in full swing. Beyond Dlin-MC3-DMA, ALC-0315, and SM-102 approved by FDA for clinical use in LNP formulations, numerous advancements have been made in the development of various lipids, lipidoids, and polymers for delivering RNA to targeted organs. Here, we outline the relationship between the chemical structures of these materials and their specific targeting capabilities for different organs (Figure 2). 3D, and identified the top-performing lipid, cKK-E12, via iterative screening and structure-activity relationships (SAR) study. As a result, cKK-E12 LNPs delivered siRNA to liver and silenced Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in hepatocytes with high selectivity (Figure 3E) [107]. Furthermore, cKK-E12 LNPs were also utilized to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA for editing PCSK9 in hepatocytes of mice in a subsequent study [103]. \n\nSimilarly, Whitehead and colleagues synthesized a series of lipidoids by Michael Addition for siRNA delivery. And subsequent investigation revealed that the lead 306Oi10 LNPs resulted in much higher siRNA accumulation in liver than naked siRNA [108]. \n\nCurrently, LNPs have been increasingly employed for loading mRNA to achieve liver targeting, and applications such as gene editing and protein replacement are explored [109,110]. The mechanism underlying the liver-targeting of LNPs has been extensively studied and several findings are publicized. Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are mainly concentrated at the injection site (localized intramuscular region). It is obvious that LNPs with 1.5 mol% DMG-PEG2k facilitated notably excellent luciferase expression in situ and in the liver 4 h postadministration (Fig. 3J-K). Comprehensive luciferase expression in muscle and liver tissues is detailed in Fig. S4C-D. Despite similar particle sizes, LNPs with lower contents of PEGylated lipids showed better transfection efficiency. A notable observation was the delayed peak of luciferase expression in the liver when comparing LNPs with 1.5 mol% and 3 mol% DMG-PEG2k (Fig. 3K). \n\nThe impact of PEGylated lipid contents on the stability and transfection efficiency of LNPs represents a rarely explored area in nanoparticle research. Previous studies have suggested that the long circulation characteristics of PEGylated lipids are due to their resistance to cellular uptake [43]. As previously reported in the study, an elevated concentration of PEGylated lipids has been demonstrated to impair the efficacy of gene knockdown mediated by LNP-encapsulated siRNA [44]. These comply with our findings that LNPs with 3 mol% DMG-PEG2k show diminished transfection efficiency compared to those with 1.5 mol% DMG-PEG2k. Additionally, LNPs formulated with a lower concentration of PEGylated lipids (0.5 mol%) exhibited larger particle sizes, which further contributed to decreased transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The observed delay in the peak of luciferase expression in the liver might be attributed to the slower rate at which PEGylated lipids are shed from the nanoparticle structure. The slight differences observed in the FRET ratio among LNPs containing various contents of PEGylated lipids suggest the desynchronization between mRNA expression and nanoparticle degradation [45]. This suggests that while PEGylated lipids extend nanoparticle circulation, they may also impact the timing and efficiency of the intended gene expression within target tissues.",

In subsequent studies, Siegwart et al. [116] elucidated the hepatocyte-targeting mechanism of 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs and identified that hepatocytetargeting was related to ApoE adsorption on mRNA-LNP surface. \n\nApoE is a small, secreted protein that plays a crucial role in cellular lipid metabolism and endogenous cholesterol transport. It can bind to LDLR, which is abundant on hepatocyte surface, making it an essential component of endogenous targeting to hepatocytes. The ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting occurs through CME. Besides MC3-LNPs, 5A2-SC8-LNPs mentioned above, cKK-E12-LNPs also utilize ApoE-based hepatocyte-endogenous targeting. Paunovska et al. [91] observed that the ability of cKK-E12-LNPs to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in ApoE-/-and LDLR-/-mice was significantly lower than in wild-type mice, confirming the ApoE-dependent targeting of cKK-E12-LNPs to hepatocytes. Comparing cKK-E12-LNPs and cKK-E15-LNPs having the same ionizable lipid core but different hydrophobic tail lengths revealed that cKK-E12-LNPs exhibited efficient mRNA delivery to hepatocytes in wild-type mice. These results indicate that changes in the structure of ionizable lipids in LNPs can affect ApoE-based endogenous targeting. Besides ionizable lipids, phospholipids can also affect ApoE adsorption on the mRNA-LNPs.",

Here, we establish an efficient, safe, non-integrative method to transiently express hepatocyte-growth-factor (HGF) and epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) in hepatocytes via nucleoside-modified, lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) delivery in mice. We confirm specific hepatotropism of mRNA-LNP via intravenous injection of firefly luciferase encoding mRNA-LNP, with protein expression lasting about 3 days. In the liver, virtually all hepatocytes are transfected along with a subpopulation of endothelial and Kupffer cells. In homeostasis, HGF mRNA-LNP efficiently induce hepatocyte proliferation. In a chronic liver injury mouse model recapitulating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, injections of both HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP sharply reverse steatosis and accelerate restoration of liver function. Likewise, HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP accelerate liver regeneration after acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury with rapid return to baseline ALT levels. This study introduces mRNA-LNP as a potentially translatable safe therapeutic intervention to harness liver regeneration via controlled expression of endogenous mitogens in vivo. When severely or chronically injured, the liver loses ability to regenerate. Here, the authors utilize transient lipid nanoparticle-enclosed HGF and EGF-encoding mRNA delivery to induce hepatocyte proliferation and harness recovery of liver function in murine acute and chronic liver injury models.",

At the same time, PEG coated LNPs show much lower cellular uptake and hindered endosomal escape, creating the so called 'PEG dilemma', where too little PEGylate lipids lowers circulation time but too much lowers efficacy [131]. One of the solutions is to use pH-sensitive lipids which cleave the PEG group after endocytosis improving cargo release, although that still doesn't improve first step, of cellular uptake [132]. PEGylated lipids can also induce 'accelerated blood release' phenomena, were repeated administration of PEGylated liposomes lowers its circulation time and can create innate immune response known as complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA) [133]. When LNPs are bigger than 150 nm in diameter they will rarely leave blood vessel's capillaries to other organs and are cleared mostly via the reticuloendothelial system in liver and spleen [134]. Even if these LNPs will not be degraded by macrophages they will mostly accumulate in liver cells. To target other organs, Cheng et al., developed a library of permanently charged and ionizable lipids (SORT), defined by their optimal ratio in LNP formulations, and showed that changing the ratio of DOTAP, DODAP or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18 PA) to the remaining lipids lead to preferential accumulation of LNPs in spleen, lungs or liver [135]. Similarly, Ramishetti et al., screened a library of novel ionizable amino lipids for improved delivery to leukocytes, which are considered particularly challenging to transfect [136]. They found two promising candidates, that in LNP's composition of lipid:Chol:1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC):PEGylated lipid (50:38.5:10:1.5), showed a very low polydispersity index (PD) <0.1 with an average diameter of 50 nm, which are very desirable characteristics for",

            "text": "The surprisingly sharp pK a value dependence of LNP activity provides more insight into the complex in vivo mechanism for this highly potent class of LNPs for siRNA delivery. In brief, it has been proposed that intravenous administration of LNPs with low to zero surface charge will minimize nonspecific binding of LNPs to tissues and proteins thus increasing the likelihood of particles reaching hepatocytes. [5] In addition, we recently demonstrated that uptake of ionizable LNPs by hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo is mediated by apolipoprotein E (ApoE), [12] which is also known to preferentially associate with neutral membrane surfaces. [13] n the other hand, LNPs must acquire sufficient positive surface charge following endocytosis to promote an electrostatic interaction with the negative surface of the endosome lumen. The resulting close proximity of LNP and membrane allows lipid mixing to occur, leading to the formation of ion pairs between the exogenous amphipathic amine and endogenous anionic membrane lipids. [11,14]  he ion pairs prefer to adopt inverted, non-bilayer configurations that disrupt the integrity of the endosome membrane and the siRNA is subsequently released into the cytoplasm. [5] The ED 50 -pK a profile may, therefore, represent a balance between two opposing delivery requirements, namely minimum charge at pH 7.4 to maximize hepatocyte uptake by ApoE-mediated endocytosis and maximum positive charge in the acidified lumen of endosomes to promote membrane disruption. \n\nIf potency differences of structurally similar lipids are predominantly a function of pK a value, we hypothesized that the activity of LNPs containing two or more cationic lipids should reflect the average pK a of the particle and not the average activity measured for the individual amino lipids. To test this, LNP formulations encapsulating FVII siRNA were prepared in which the 40 mole % amino lipid component consisted of different ratios of lipids 15, 16, and 17 thus producing LNPs with average surface pK a values that increased incrementally from 5.64 (15) to 6.93 (17).",

Moreover, mRNA-loaded CL4H6-based LNPs showed higher protein expression in hepatocytes than the mRNA-loaded MC3-LNPs [35].\n\nSpecific organ targeting and protein expression are essential advantages of LNP-based RNA-delivery technology; therefore, the development of mRNA-delivery technology for targeted organs is strongly desired for protein-replacement therapy. B lymphocytes play an important role in antibody production, and dysregulation of B-cells induces autoimmune disorders. B-cells are attractive targets for gene delivery in order to modulate their functions; however, in vivo mRNAdelivery systems targeting B-cells to allow sufficient protein expression have not been demonstrated. Fenton et al. [85] synthesized a novel lipid (OF-Deg-Lin) for spleen-selective mRNA delivery and confirmed that OF-Deg-Lin-based LNPs could specifically produce proteins in Bcells. OF-Deg-Lin is an ionizable lipid that contains degradable linkers. The authors prepared Cy5-labeled mRNA-loaded LNPs and evaluated their biodistribution and luciferase expression, revealing that OF-Deg-Lin-based LNPs were mainly delivered to the liver; however, luciferase-expression efficiency was lower than that of the spleen, which demonstrated >85% of detected luciferase expression (Fig. 9). They hypothesized that the organ-dependent degradation of OF-Deg-Lin ester linkers affected spleen-specific luciferase expression and tested this hypothesis by preparing non-degradable OF-02-based mRNA-loaded LNPs. They found that OF-02-based mRNA-loaded LNPs were primarily distributed in the liver along with observed luciferase expression. Their findings suggested the importance of designing lipid molecules for selective targeting and protein expression [85]. Additionally, Cheng et al",

Plasmids encapsulated LNPs were mainly distributed in liver at 24 hours post injection (Figure 7B) and were dispersed near vein area (Figure 7C). The results showed plasmids encapsulated LNPs successfully promoted HERC2 expression in hepatocytes. (Figure 7D,E) We next investigated the regulatory function of HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs in APAP hepatoxicity (Figure 7F). The pathology analysis indicated ameliorated liver damage in APAP-injected mice treated with HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs compared to the controls (Figure 7G). Consistently, declined serum SGPT and SGOT level was found in HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs-treated mice compared to control mice (Figure 7H). We also observed attenuated accumulation of APAP-adducts (Figure 7I,J) and MDA (Figure 7K) in liver tissues when mice were treated with HERC2-loaded LNPs . Moreover, HERC2-loaded LNPs administration markedly decreased CYP2E1 expression in hepatocytes (Figure 7L,M), which was caused by impaired -catenin level (Figure 7N). Together, the data indicated that targeted delivery of HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs attenuated DILI by modulating -catenin activity and consequent CYP2E1 expression.",

The LNPs were formulated using 1.2dipalmitoyl-sn-glyceo-3-phosphocholine,1,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethylpropylamine, 3-N-[\u03c9-methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) 2000 ) carbamoyl]-1,2-dimyristyloxy-propylamine and cholesterol. The LNP-siPLK1 resulted in reducing the amount of secreted viral particles on HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes [176]. In the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), the accumulation of LNPs resulted in the secretion of several cytokines which are then followed by neutrophilic inflammation. To overcome this, Sato and groups prepared the LNPs which were modified on the surface with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), a hepatocyte-specific ligand. The modified LNPs improved the hepatocyte specificity and together with PEGylation displayed a reduction in the LNP-associated toxicity without affecting the gene-silencing activity in hepatocytes. It was evident that a single injection of LNPs, significantly reduced the HBV genomic DNA and antigen in chimeric mice with humanized livers infected with HBV without displaying any sign of toxicity [177].",

[45] Hereafter, we refer to DSPG-containing LNPs as srLNPs and LNPs based on the lipid composition of Onpattro as DSPC-LNPs (Figure 1d). LNP formulations with an effective anionic surface charge of \u2264\u221215 mV have not been previously reported. In all cases, a nitrogen to phosphate (N:P) ratio of 6:1 was used, as is typical for larger nucleic acid payloads. [46] Following microfluidic assembly, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed LNPs with a typical electron-dense core structure ( Figure 1e). [47][48][49][50] Within DSPC-LNPs (47.0 \u00b1 13.9 nm), both amorphous and lamellar core structures were present, whereas the core structure of srLNPs (66.6 \u00b1 22.0 nm) contained a mixture of amorphous, unilamellar, and polymorphic structures, as has been previously reported for LNP-mRNA systems. [51,52] Particle sizes of both DSPC-LNPs and srLNPs (determined through cryo-EM image analysis) were comparable to the number-weighted average determined by dynamic light scattering ( Figure 1f and Table S1 (Supporting Information)) and both formulations were well below the size threshold considered favorable for size-dependent phagocytosis, [53,54] as well as for unhindered passage through the fenestrae (180 \u00b1 41 nm; murine) of the liver endothelium (i.e., unrestricted access to hepatocytes). [55] In all cases, mRNA encapsulation efficiencies were >95% ( Figure 1g). Crucially, however, srLNPs possessed a significantly more anionic (\u03b6-potential \u2248 \u221220 mV) surface charge compared to DSPC-LNPs (\u03b6-potential \u2248 \u22125 mV), indicative of DSPG exposed at the lipid-",

            "text": "The PEG lipid stabilises the LNPs during manufacturing and storage, and it increases the circulation half-life. However, PEG lipids inhibit cellular transfection; hence, they are designed to rapidly diffuse from the LNPs after IV administration (Chen et al, 2016). The LNPs are passively targeted to the liver (Shi et al, 2011), and the size of the LNPs permits delivery through the fenestrated endothelium in the liver to the underlying hepatocytes (Chen et al, 2016). In addition, active hepatocyte targeting has been shown to occur via surface adsorption of apolipoprotein E, which targets the LNPs to the internalising low-density lipoprotein receptor expressed on hepatocytes (Akinc et al, 2010;Chen et al, 2016). After cellular uptake, endosomal escape of siRNA into the cytosol may be facilitated via interactions between the re-protonated ionisable cationic lipid in the acidic endosomal environment and anionic endogenous lipids in the endosomal membrane (Habrant et al, 2016). \n\nExosomes are particular lipid-based nanocarriers (Barile & Vassalli, 2017). These nanosized vesicles are shed from the cells, encapsulating part of the cellular cytoplasm in the process (Pathan et al, 2019). They are remarkable in their biocompatibility and potential for highly specific active targeting through surface display of endogenous cellular ligands. The main challenges for using exosomes as delivery systems are (i) reproducible, large-scale production and (ii) effective loading of drugs. Additionally, exosome heterogeneity is caused by their natural content of proteins and nucleic acids derived from the host cell (Willms et al, 2018;Jeppesen et al, 2019). This complicates their use as therapeutic delivery agents. The therapeutic promise of exosomes has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Wiklander et al, 2019).",

            "text": "Systemic administration LNPs are an ideal delivery system for mRNA, whether administered intranasally or intravenously. A significant observation on mRNA-LNPs passively delivered to the lungs by intravenous administration is that the addition of cationic lipids alone can redirect mRNA-LNPs from the liver to the lungs. This finding is noteworthy as it suggests a feasible strategy for pulmonary targeting while decreasing off-target delivery to the liver. \n\nUsing the SORT strategy, Siegwart et al. [106,116,155] added 50% permanently cationic lipids containing quaternary amino groups, such as DOTAP, Dimethyldidodecylammonium bromide (DDAB), and EPC, into the traditional mRNA-LNP formulation that was initially intended for liver targeting. This modification enabled the redirection of LNPs towards pulmonary delivery. The addition of cationic lipids significantly elevated the pKa of mRNA-LNPs to nine, far exceeding pKa of liver-targeted mRNA-LNPs (six -seven). This modification successfully enabled the selective transfection of approximately 40% of lung epithelial cells, 65% of pulmonary endothelial cells, and 20% of pulmonary immune cells. LoPresti et al. [141] observed that replacing the standard helper lipids in LNPs with cationic lipid DOTAP similarly leads to an enhancement of lung tropism for mRNA-LNPs. The available evidence indicates that the pulmonary targeting outcomes achieved by adding cationic lipids and high pKa values are closely related to the changes in the surface protein coronas of LNPs. LNPs modified with quaternary ammonium groups [106,116,156] with high pKa values, lead to a change in the adsorbed protein corona from ApoE to vitronectin. This altered protein corona preferentially binds to the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin receptor, which is highly expressed in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, thereby making LNPs more prone to accumulate in the lungs [116]. \n\nA recent study has shown that incorporating cationic lipids as helper lipids in LNPs enhances their targeting specificity towards pulmonary endothelial cells [142].",

These interactions can enhance the uptake of LNPs by target cells, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic payloads such as nucleic acids or drugs. Since surface charge, size and lipid components of nanoparticles have been reported to modulate delivery to specific organs, researchers have created some modified LNPs that interact with endogenous proteins to provide tissue specificity [120,141]. When LNPs have a neutral surface charge, the formation of complexes between LNPs and apoE facilitates transport to the liver and uptake by hepatocytes and hepatoma cells through LDL receptors [202]. LNPs conjugated with apoE are successfully targeted the central nervous system, crossing the bloodbrain barrier and releasing an anticholinergic drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease [203]. In contrast, LNPs with anionic charge can be utilized to facilitate delivery to spleen via adsorption to \u03b22-glycoprotein I [204,205]. In addition, the different phospholipids not only affect LNP tissue-tropism but may also interfere with the biological process of protein translation [206].",

Fluorescence spectroscopy of tissue lysates from PEG-DMG-LNP-treated animals revealed no statistically significant differences in tumor accumulation but showed a possible trend towards more tumor accumulation when animals were pre-treated with liposomes for both Cy5.5 (control 3.17 % vs liposomes 5.92 %) (Fig. 3f) and Cy7 (control 3.61 % vs liposomes 7.04 %) (Fig. 3g).

In the blood circulation and among different functions, ApoE is involved in the transportation of lipids to the liver for recycling. Recently, Sebastiani et al. [117] showed that the binding of ApoE induce lipid rearrangement of the shell and the core of LNPs, potentially leading to a different endosomal escape. To study this effect, they produced LNPs made of deuterated lipids coupled with a small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis, to decipher the composition and the global structure of the LNPs, but also more precisely the distribution of the lipids around the particle. After incubation with ApoE, rearrangement between the lipid in the shell and the core occurs, which leads to a drop in mRNA encapsulation 1 day post-incubation. More interestingly, cholesterol enrichment in the shell is observed. Even if more studies are still needed, it appears that ApoE interaction with LNPs can explain the liver accumulation, thanks to its biological role. Moreover, the difference in transfection efficiency could be linked to a change in the lipid composition of the shell/core after this interaction.",

            "text": "Similar to the liver-targeting strategy, numerous optimized lung-targeting LNPs have been identified by meticulously screening the lipids/ LNPs libraries. 46,47 It's worth noting that, in contrast to liver-specific delivery with O-series LNPs, N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in ionizable lipid tail) exhibit a tendency to preferentially deliver mRNA to the lungs via regulation of protein corona adsorbed on the surface of LNPs, followed by the observation that manifold types of pulmonary cells would be targeted by simply tuning head group structure of N-series LNPs. For example, 306-N16B LNP showed excellent pulmonary endothelium transfection ability, and 113-N16B LNP performed better pulmonary macrophages and epithelium delivery than the former. From the previous discussion, optimizing novel ionizable lipids is feasible for designing liver-targeting LNPs. Also, the SORT LNPs technology can achieve lung targeting. LNPs containing diverse classes of SORT molecules facilitate organ-specific targeting of SORT LNPs by binding to different subsets of plasma proteins. 25 When Daniel J. Siegwart's group first characterized SORT LNPs, they found that a modest increase in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (EPC) or dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDAB) in LNPs resulted in a gradual shift in luminescent activity from the liver to the lungs. 42 Furthermore,  A-C) Adapted from permission. 41 Copyright 2023, American Chemical Society.

            "text": "Generally, PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the positive charge of LNPs and suppresses not only the aggregation of each LNP and opsonization by biological proteins such as complement but also the interactions between LNPs and cells, indicating that PEG shielding of the LNPs influences their cellular uptake efficiency and biodistribution in the body (39)(40)(41). For example, greater PEG modification and modification with PEGs with longer chains inhibit the cellular uptake of LNPs, resulting in reduced cellular uptake of the molecules being delivered and inhibition of their desired functions, although these modifications inhibit opsonization, thus enhancing the stability of LNPs in the blood (39)(40)(41). Many authors have suggested that optimal modification of PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 is a better compromise between anti-opsonization and efficient delivery strategies (42). Therefore, we used two types of LNP modified with PEG at a molecular weight of 2000 in different ratios. We showed that each LNP-CpG improved the immune-stimulatory activity of CpG ODN in mouse DCs (Figure 1). This enhanced immune-stimulatory activity might result from an increase in the number of CpG ODNs taken up by each DC, because the CpG ODN is condensed into a space in the LNP-CpG. We showed that LNP(0.5%)-CpG had stronger immune-stimulatory activity (in terms of cytokine production and CD86 expression) than LNP(3%)-CpG in mouse DCs (Figure 1). Therefore, a greater number of LNP(0.5%)-CpG than LNP(3%)-CpG might have been taken up by the DCs, because the ratio of PEG modification was less in the former than in the latter. CpG ODN is localized to the endosomes or lysosomes after cellular internalization and binds to endosomal TLR9 (43,44). In addition, by using TLR9 deficient mice, we recently showed that cytokine production by bone marrow cells in response to LNP-CpG is completely dependent on TLR9 (35).",

Electron microscopic observations revealed that most of the LNPs were located in the space of Disse even at early time point (3 min after administration). Both rapid blood clearance and the accumulation of the bare LNPs which were absent in ApoE-deficient mice, were restored by the co-administration of recombinant ApoE protein. On the other hand, the GalNAc/Shielded LNPs gradually accumulated in liver tissue and were endocytosed by hepatocytes in wild-type mice. The ApoE is known to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as well as LDLR through the arginine-rich receptor-binding domain [48]. Treatment with heparin, which can compete with HSPGs, even 10 min after administration of the bare LNPs significantly suppressed both the accumulation and gene silencing of the LNPs in hepatocytes, suggesting that HSPGs in the liver are involved in the rapid accumulation of the bare LNPs. The relatively slow uptake of the bare or GalNAc/Shielded LNPs could be explained by assuming that receptors are mainly distributed on microvilli but not on coated pits and therefore a certain time would be required for the particles to migrate to coated pits for internalization [49,50].",

In the luciferase assay, results of the DGTS group were significantly weaker than those of the DSPC group. DSPC LNPs produced almost 40-fold higher luciferase expression when compared to DGTS LNPs at 200 ng mRNA per well dose (Fig. 1f).\n\nAfter evaluating in vitro transfection efficiency of LNP formulations, we investigated whether this drastic change in mRNA transfection would be reproducible in vivo. We focused primarily on DGTS since it has a zwitterionic nature similar to DSPC, which will retain the surface charge as of DSPC, and therefore it has more comparable structure that can be tested further. 29 We intravenously administered DSPC or DGTS LNPs encapsulating firefly luciferase mRNA to BALB/c mice, and monitored luminescent signals using in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Primary luciferase signals were detected in the liver as has been previously observed through a ApoE-dependent LNP uptake into hepatocytes. Interestingly, strong liver transfections were detected not only in the DSPC LNP-treated animals, but also in DGTS LNP-treated animals, from 4 to 48 h post-administration (Fig. 3a). In opposition to the results from in vitro transfection studies, DGTS LNPs resulted in improvement in luciferase expression when compared to DSPC LNPs in all time points (Fig. 3a). Images obtained from IVIS analysis were further analyzed to compare bioluminescent signals in the same regions of interest. In all time points for imaging, DGTS LNPs produced 4-fold stronger bioluminescent signals than DSPC LNPs (p < 0.05, Fig. 3b). These results indicated that LNP-mediated in vivo transfection is poorly correlated with in vitro transfection results, as demonstrated earlier. 9,37 In addition, it implied that inclusion of different structural lipids affects interactions between nanoparticles and biological systems.\n\nHaving observed that DGTS LNPs effectively transfected liver",

The third component is cholesterol which is involved in the intracellular delivery of LNPs. Absence of cholesterol receptors that recycle it from the endosomes can enhance the accumulation of LNPs, and thus increase the level of gene silencing. 44 Arteta et al. stated that LNP surface may include cholesterol crystals due to its limited solubility and this surface configuration of LNPs may promote endosomal escape. 50 Recent studies revealed that liver microenvironment other than hepatocytes can be targeted with LNPs containing oxidized cholesterols. 38 We have reported that plant-based cholesterol analogs transformed LNP morphology and stimulated endosomal escape of LNPs. 36 Finally, LNPs contain structural lipid which is primarily present on their surface. 23,48 As the name suggests, it contributes to nucleic acid packaging and stability of the nanoparticles. 22 Moreover, literature has highlighted that these helper or structural lipids enable structural transition of LNPs in endosomes, stimulating cytosolic release of nucleic acid. 30,47 Li et al. and Kauffman et al. compared 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) as structural lipids, and found that LNPs containing DOPE instead of DSPC more effectively delivered mRNA. 18,24 It may suggest that the most effective LNP for mRNA delivery can be distinct from the current standard formulation which contains DS",

Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein coronas [34,111] that could alter LNP fate. Along these lines, studies of polystyrene nanoparticles have determined that positively charged particles preferentially adsorb proteins with isoelectric points less than 5.5 (such as albumin), while negatively charged particles (and particles with surfaces bearing acidic functional groups) predominantly bind proteins with isoelectric points greater than 5.5 (such as IgG) [112]. To achieve true organspecific delivery, however, the SORT approach still needs improvements to prevent leakage to other organs. Further, using wholeorgan IVIS imaging for quantitative analysis, as in the SORT study, requires caution, because scattering and absorption effects from incoming and emitted light as well as quenching effects may impact the readout from the isolated organs, and these effects will hamper the quantitative value of these measurements [113]. Further, the liposome field has learned that successfully clinical translating liposomes requires low surface charge [56].\n\nAnother lesson learned from the liposome field is that enhanced circulation time can improve accumulation in cancer tissue. Defects in cancer tissue's rapidly growing vasculature may lead to passive extraversion/accumulation of liposomes in tumors, an effect sometimes referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [18]. This proposed phenomenon is, however, heavily debated in the nanomedicine field [116]. Both the nanoprimer approach described above [106] and including longchained PEG-DSPE lipids (known from the Doxil \u00d2 formulation) that are less prone to dissociation than PEG-DMG [51] are strategies that could enhance LNP circulation time and thus improve LNP accumulation in non-liver organs.\n\nAs explored above, size and surface charge are parameters that partly control LNP biodistribution. Whether the biodistribution of LNPs without active-targeting ligands is associated with passive targeting is hard to determine",

In particular, it has been consistently shown that most LNPs are sequestered and degraded in lysosomes 12 or removed to extracellular space, 44 significantly limiting their therapeutic effects. 19,34 In addition, it is difficult to target nonhepatic organs with LNPs due to high liver tropism. It was demonstrated that spleen 21,25 and lung endothelium 28,29 can be targeted by modification of LNP formulations. Nonetheless, the use of LNPs with regards to non-hepatic delivery is still limited, and is the area of focus for next generation therapeutics.\n\nTypically, LNPs consist of four lipids: (1) cationic lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid. The first component i.e. the cationic lipid is generally composed of a cationic head group and lipid tails, and is located in the core of LNPs with nucleic acids. This component is extensively explored because of its ability to assemble negatively charged nucleic acids into particles via electrostatic forces, and also in causing cytosolic release of nucleic acid by its interactions with the endosomal membrane. 1,10,16,45 The second component is the PEG lipid which possesses a PEG chain anchored to a lipid headgroup. This molecule prevents aggregation and provides stability by causing ste",

            "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the finding that other cationic helper lipids (EPC and DDAB) within such LNPs cause similar protein expression in the pancreas (Melamed et al., 2023). For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

            "text": "The LNP-based mRNA vaccines approved by the FDA for clinical are capable of protecting mRNAs against protease degradation and of facilitating their cellular uptake across the cell membrane.However, they still face several unresolved challenges.The administration of mRNA cancer vaccines typically involves repetitive injections, which can lead to lipid accumulation in tissues over time and clearance by anti-drug antibodies.Notably, the majority of LNPs accumulate in the liver, contradicting the initial objective of mRNA vaccines in achieving their intended function [58].Researchers should endeavor to modify LNPs in order to manipulate organ targeting.Alongside direct modifications of LNPs themselves, local administration techniques such as intramural injection through lymph nodes can also enhance the targeting potential of LNPs.This approach prevents their systemic distribution to specific organs and contributes to the selective delivery of LNPs.\n\nAfter entering the target cells, LNPs must facilitate the mRNAs' escape from the endosomal membrane for translation into functional proteins.However, most mRNAs are degraded in lysosomes following endocytosis, with only a small fraction successfully evading this fate and reaching the cytoplasmic compartment.Thus, there remains a need to improve delivery efficiency.To modify the surface characteristics of LNPs, Zhang et al. employed a straightforward fluorination technique involving the creation of fluorinated PEG-lipids through effective condensation reactions [62].This alteration can improve mRNA translation efficacy by encouraging endosomal escape and cellular absorption.Moreover, the LNP-based mRNA vaccines have higher levels of reactive oxygen species formation during translation, which result in a reduction in translation efficiency as well as inflammation and other side effects.Yang et al. developed innovative LNPs (G-LNPs) for mRNA vaccines by synthesizing a lipid-modified poly(guanidine thioctic acid) polymer [63].By eliminating reactive oxygen species that hinder translation and trigger inflammatory responses, G-LNPs significantly enhance the translational efficiency of loaded mRNAs while minimizing inflammation post-vaccination.A major hurdle in eliciting robust anti-tumor immune responses lies in the insufficient accumulation of LNP-based mRNA vaccines within antigen-presenting cells.",

YSK-LNPs showed high FVII gene-silencing activity with no dependency on dose. Furthermore, we confirmed the 80 nm sized YSK-LNPs showed good siRNA delivery efficiency to hepatocytes by a confocal laser scanning microscopic observation of ICR mouse liver tissues. The confocal images indicated that the YSK-LNPs showed low accumulation in blood vessels, and siRNAs were specifically localized to the extravascular region where the hepatocytes were present.

The adsorbed proteins are expected to possibly influence organ tropism of LNPs (Cheng et al. 2020;Dilliard et al. 2021), and this assumption was evidenced by the finding that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) facilitated hepatic entry of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes in the liver (Akinc et al. 2010). \n\nBased on the different surface states of LNPs mentioned above (Fig. 1), the surface engineering strategies can be classified into three main categories: \n\n(1) substitution of PEGylated dimyristoyl lipid; \n\n(2) alteration of surface charge; and (3) modification with targeting ligand. Furthermore, these strategies can be achieved either by direct incorporation of presynthesized molecules or by in situ conjugation of targeting moieties. Specific chemicals and preparation methods are summarized in the following sections.",

            "text": "Particles were incubated with cells on ice for 30 min to allow sufficient binding. Internalization was initiated when particles were removed and cells were transferred to 37 \u00b0C. Despite a lower amount of LNP binding on the cell surface, A6 LNPs demonstrated a rapid cytoplasmic release of Cy5-labeled mRNA approximately within 15 min after internalization. In contrast, cKK-E12 LNPs were preferentially bound to hepatocytes, however upon internalization, most of the mRNA aggregated in vesicles. We observed a gradual increase in fluorescence within the cytoplasm 30 min after internalization. Inclusion of A6 lipidoids into our Syn-3 formulations accelerated mRNA release, which was observed within 15 min of incubation. We further co-stained the LNP treated hepatocytes (1 h incubation) with Lysotracker green (Fig. 3l), confirming that the majority of mRNA LNP aggregates within hepatocytes were trapped in the endo-lysosome systems. We also used cellular fractionation to distinguish the mRNA released in the cytosol from that sequestered in the endolysosomal compartment (Fig. 3m, n). The amount of mRNA in the cytosol and endosomes was quantified with quantitative PCR following fractionation (Fig. 3m). Consistent with the microscopy results, cytosolic Epo mRNA was detected in cells treated with A6 5-15 min after incubation (Fig. 3m). Peak concentrations were reached at 25 min; and then decreased gradually over the next 50 min, which may be due to the gradual degradation of mRNA. Inclusion of A6 lipid into cKK-E12 formulations accelerated cargo release, with maximal release moving from 55 min (cKK-E12 LNPs) to 15 min (Syn-3 LNPs) after incubation. These results suggest that addition of A6 lipid into LNPs enhances intracellular endosomal release of LNPs. Despite this enhanced endosomal release, we noted that a very large fraction of mRNA is still trapped in the membrane systems within hepatocytes for all three treatment groups (Fig. 3l, m, Supplementary Fig. 28).",

            "text": "Along the lines above, Ouyang et al. [108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

            "text": "Next, we validated LNP biodistribution and LNP-mediated mRNA expression patterns in mice, focusing on cell-specific LNP distribution and mRNA expression within the murine liver, the largest RES organ in mammals. For all wild-type mouse experiments, LNP-mRNA formulations were injected (i.v.) in 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6a). To assess LNP distribution and functional mRNA delivery within individual hepatic and nonhepatic (i.e., spleen and bone marrow) RES cell types, mice were anesthetized, a trans-cardiac collagenase perfusion performed, (parenchymal and nonparenchymal hepatic) cells separated, and individual cell types detected using cellspecific antibodies (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information for representative flow cytometry density plots). To monitor LNP biodistribution across RES cell types and tissues, LNP-mRNA formulations, containing a nonexchangeable, fluorescent lipid probe (1,1dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD), 0.5 mol%), were administered ( Figure 6b). Importantly, this allowed us to full decouple and independently assess cellspecific LNP targeting and resultant mRNA expression. At 2 hpi, for both DSPC-LNPs and srLNPs (42.75 mg kg \u22121 total lipid), we observed extensive LNP accumulation within the mouse liver (Figure 6c,d) as compared to accumulation in other RES organs, namely bone marrow and spleen ( Figure S8, Supporting Information), the latter being a smaller but highly efficient unit of the mononuclear phagocyte system. [83] Notably, both LNP formulations distributed to all hepatic cell types, as has previously been described for LNP formulations based on Onpattro, [82,84] however, srLNPs showed significantly enhanced uptake (p < 0.001) in all liver cell types ( Figure  6c). Most strikingly, srLNPs yielded an approximately fivefold and an approximately threefold targeting",

This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes. The length of fatty acid chains of the PEG lipid is responsible for the time of dissociation from the LNPs. Since PEGylated lipids with myristoyl (C14) chains are rapidly dissociated from the LNPs in the blood circulation, they do not interfere the process of FVII knockdown. We previously showed in mice that long circulation of siRNA-loaded pH-sensitive liposomes modified with PEG was observed only when DSPE-PEG but not distearoylglycerol (DSG)-PEG was used. Our results suggest that the electrostatic interaction between lipid molecules on the surface of the liposomes is a critical determinant for the in vivo effect of PEGylation [115].\n\nPEGylation of LNPs and chemical modification of siRNA reduce their immunogenicity, but it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of immune reactions, especially in susceptible individuals [116]. Recently, Chen et al. reported that incorporation of a small amount (4 mol% of total lipid content) of dexamethasone into LNPs can suppress the immune response [117]. Such an approach provides a positive perspective for future clinical trials and commercialization.",

As a control, we found that LNPs formulated with neutral cholesterol and cationic helper lipids detargeted the liver as previously reported (18)(19)(20). The difference in liver delivery was not likely driven by overall LNP potency since both libraries showed similar lung delivery (Fig. 2C). Given the unexpected liver delivery with (+ 0) LNPs, we compared delivery in five cell types isolated from the liver. We found a significant increase in delivery, relative to (0 +) LNPs, across all hepatic cells (Fig. 2D and SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). We performed the same analysis in the lung and found that Fig. 1. Four libraries containing LNPs with varied charge of cholesterol or helper lipid formed small and stable LNPs.

These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

            "text": "LNPs can bind with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in plasma to form ApoE-bound lipoproteins, which are mainly cleared by the liver, allowing LNPs to reach the liver preferentially for liver targeting. This method is commonly used to deliver RNA to the liver using cationic or ionizable LNPs. The presence of ionizable lipids and intentional short acyl chain PEG lipids enhance the ability of LNPs to deliver RNA compared to liposomes. Liver targeting is insufficient for treatment, as specific cell targeting is often necessary. Therefore, Kim et al modified the overall size of LNPs by adjusting the polyethylene glycol (PEG) content, specifically targeting hepatocytes. 76 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be modified to selectively target specific cell types. They offer the benefits of delivering mRNA with high transfection efficiency, high expression levels, and good stability, making them crucial carriers for mRNA vaccine development. 77 bumin Carriers and FDC Albumin carriers can specifically bind to cell surface albumin receptor (gp60), which binds to intracellular caveolin-1, leading to membrane invagination and the formation of caveolae. Caveolae can transport albumin carriers to tumors, making carriers bind to secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine protein overexpressed in tumors, thereby targeting the albumin carriers to the tumor. 78 The tumor-targeting effect of ferritin is ten times greater than that of the EPR effect. Ferritin does not require surface modification as it naturally targets tumors through its specific affinity for transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is overexpressed in malignant tumors. Ferritin is the optimal size of 12 nm for inducing the EPR effect caused by disrupting the blood and lymphatic systems in tumors. 79 AuNPs, Nanogels, and ASP AuNPs, after being injected into the body, can accumulate in inflammatory and tumor sites through the enhanced permeability and EPR effect to achieve passive targeting. 37 Nanogels also accumulate at the site of lesions through the enhanced permeability and EPR effect to achieve passive targeting.",

            "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

Interestingly, the number of hit compounds was higher for LNPs than for the lipoplexes, suggesting that microfluidic technologies improved the screening of carrier materials for RNA delivery.\n\nPEGylation of LNPs is indispensable for ensuring circulation time in blood. Additionally, PEGylated lipids play an important role in controlling LNP size. Belliveau et al. [37] demonstrated the effect of PEGylated molecule concentration on LNP size using a chaotic mixer device, D-LinKC2-DMA as a pH-sensitive cationic lipid, and PEG-C-DMA as a PEGylated lipid. Increase in the concentration of PEGylated lipids to a range of 1 mol% to 5 mol% reduced LNP size from 54 nm to 28 nm, and smaller-sized LNPs forming at high concentrations of PEGylated lipids. Their results showed that the combination of the microfluidic device and the molar ratio of PEGylated lipid allowed control of the size of siRNAloaded LNPs (20-100 nm). Moreover, D-LinKC2-DMA-based LNPs showed 50% factor VII (FVII) silencing at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg in mice. Other studies demonstrated siRNA-loaded LNP-mediated gene silencing in hepatocytes using various sizes of siRNA-loaded LNPs, sizes of which were controlled according to PEG-dimyristolglycerol (DMG) concentration [64,77]. The authors reported that lipids including PEG-DMG resulted in a faster dissociation rate of 45-nm-sized LNPs relative to that observed for 80-nm-sized LNPs, with the dissociation rate affecting gene-knockdown activity. Additionally, Kumar et al. [63] studied the effect of PEGylated lipids on LNP physicochemical properties using a Ttype microfluidic device and DLin-MC3-DMA as a pH-sensitive cationic lipid.

A few reports mentioned that the endocytosis of spherical nanoparticles is relatively easier in comparison to other shapes. Alternatively, non-spherical nanoparticles are more inclined to flow through capillaries. The exact mechanism of action underlying the shape and structure and its role in vivo remains obscure to date. Due to the involvement of many technological challenges, the actual mechanism of action stemming from shape and structure remains widely unexplored. Therefore, the research needs to be accelerated towards understanding their activity in deforming membranes and therapeutic efficiency. \n\nSurface Composition: Efficient delivery and the biodistribution of LNPs can be influenced by the surface composition of delivering vectors. Well-known examples include the surface modification of LNPs by incorporating the PEG-Lipids by PEGylation. This process of PEGylation is known to alter nanocarrier trafficking and extend circulation half-life. Nevertheless, along with improving biodistribution and circulation, PEGylation can also result in reducing the uptake of LNPs by steric hinderance and limits interactions with the plasma membrane. Hence, the PEG-lipids detach into the serum and alleviate the steric hinderance to favor endosomal uptake [72,76].",

A single dose toxicity test revealed that the CL4H6-LNPs were tolerated for at least up to levels of 5 mg siRNA/kg while the undegradable MC3-LNPs showed a dose-dependent elevation in both alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase and a decrease in body weight. Furthermore, repeated dose toxicity also confirmed that the CL4H6-LNPs were well tolerated. \n\nThese strategies for improving the safety of LNPs, including maximizing hepatocyte-specificity, reduction of the CL dose, and the addition of biodegradability to CLs, are not exclusive and could be combined with each other.

This platform combines in vitro and in vivo screening strategies; it can be extended to other carrier systems and potentially for various administration routes. In addition, we revealed that the preferential transfection in the liver over other organs/tissues of the selected LNPs is not directly related to targeted in vivo distribution or cellular uptake efficiency of LNPs; rather the intracellular trafficking events including lysosome escape, DNA release, etc. play a more critical role. We deduced that LNPs with similar physical characteristics are distributed among different organs in a similar manner; but they show tissue-specific differences in transfection across different cell types due to differences in intracellular trafficking efficiency in a composition-dependent manner. Finally, we developed an innovative strategy that co-delivers anti-inflammatory siRNA and pDNA to further extend the expression of pDNA therapy. This LNP-based co-delivery strategy further highlights the unique advantages of an extended transgene expression profile using pDNA delivery and offers new opportunities for pDNA-based gene medicine applications.",

In this context, it was important to establish that the presence of the (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG did not negatively impact the circulation lifetime of the PEG-DSG LNP systems employed here. This is of potential concern since (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG contains three carboxylic acid chemical groups at its hydrophilic terminal end (Figure 3). The pKa values of these carboxylic acid groups are predicted to be 3.11, 3.69, and 3.99 (Marvin, ChemAxon, http://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/), indicating that this PSMA-targeting ligand will possess a strong negative charge at physiological pH. Consistent with these estimates, the zeta-potential of LNP containing 1 mol% of (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG was determined to be \u221214.97 \u00b1 9.34 mV, whereas nontargeted LNP exhibited a zeta-potential of \u22124.91 \u00b1 11 mV. LNPs exhibiting negative charges can be rapidly cleared from the bloodstream via opsonization by serum proteins and subsequent accumulation in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver and spleen. 39,40 he circulation lifetime of the PSMA-targeting LNP was determined following i.v. administration of tritiated ( 3 H) PSMA-targeted or nontargeted LNP to mice at 1 mg siRNA/ kg body weight (see Materials and Methods). Blood was collected via intracardiac sampling at 0.5, 2, 8, 24 hours postinjection and the percentage of the injected LNP remaining in the circulation was determined (Figure 5). Importantly, the   PSMA-targeted and nontargeted LNPs exhibited very similar circulation properties; both formulations had t 1/2 values of approximately 10-12 hours.",

When iLNPs are systemically administered, they may bind with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in circulation, then interact with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a highly-expressed protein on hepatocytes, and finally being internalized by hepatocytes via LDLR-mediated endocytosis [43,44]. In this study, the LDLR over-expressed HepG2-Luc cells were used to evaluate whether ApoE was an important factor for cellular uptake of iLNPs. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, it can be clearly found that when ApoE was added into the culture medium, the amounts of cellular uptake iLP181 LNPs were significant more than that without ApoE, demonstrating that the ApoE significantly boosted the cellular uptake of iLNPs. In addition, subcellular localization of the payload nucleic acids also verified that ApoE promoted the internalization of iLP181 LNPs (Fig. 2E  and F).",

            "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. 61,64,65 Yan et al. demonstrated the hepatic clearance of liposomes via ApoE as a ligand\u2212receptormediated uptake process using ApoE-deficient mice. 61 LNPs also passively accumulate in the liver as a consequence of physiology since the liver is a highly perfused organ with fenestrated capillaries. 65 his endogenous ligand\u2212receptor-mediated targeting suggests that similar approaches using exogenous ligands may be useful for LNP targeting to different cell and tissue types. 65,66 or example, the PEG-conjugated ligand anisamide interacts with sigma receptors expressed by murine melanoma cells (B16F10) and has been used to increase LNP-mediated siRNA delivery to lung tumors and metastases. 67 However, the efficacy of anisamide for LNP targeting may be limited by the subcellular organization of sigma receptors and the impact of anisamide on LNP endocytosis. 68 n other studies, incorporating small-molecule ligands into LNP formulations has enabled particle targeting and improved cellular uptake. The small-molecule ligand strophanthidin has been incorporated in LNP formulations to improve in vitro transfection of cells derived from different tissue types.",

            "text": "Over the last few years, LNP-based RNA vaccines have been administered to hundreds of millions of people. \n\nThese nanoparticles are made of a polyethylene (PEG) lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and a cationic lipid and have an average particle size of 70-90 nm and are suitable for delivery of DNA and RNA molecules (Brader et al., 2021;Cui et al., 2022). When loaded with RNA, LNPs not only protect their payload from degradation but are also capable of delivering it to cells and facilitate their intracellular entry (Whitehead et al., 2009). When injected intramuscularly or intravenously, LNPs deliver most of their payload to the liver where a dose as low as 2.5 mg/kg can effectively suppress hepatocyte gene expression for as long as 11 days after a single injection (Zimmermann et al., 2006). \n\nWhile to date all clinically approved LNP-base therapies target the liver (Love et al., 2010), there is an urgent need to develop LNP formulations that allow payload delivery to non-hepatic organs and tissues. This has been, in part, facilitated by the development of new lipid-like molecule lipidoid libraries (Love et al., 2010;Alabi et al., 2013). By screening epoxide-modified lipid-polymer hybrids at different lipid:siRNA ratios, R. Langer, D. Anderson and colleagues identified a new branched lipid compound termed 7C1 that exhibit long circulation time and preferential payload delivery to ECs with reduced hepatic accumulation (Dahlman et al., 2014). Interestingly, the reason for the preferential endothelial uptake of 7C1 LNPs has never been established.",

Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs.

Another work accomplished by Whitehead and co-workers got a similar conclusion. Further investigation by Siegwart revealed that this selective organ targeting effect was related to the categories of serum proteins that bind with LNP after intravenous injection. 73 gure 3. Design of selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and their organ-specific targeting delivery after intravenous injection. Traditional four-component LNP with fixed ratios is proved to be mainly delivered to the liver, which is caused by the interactions between adsorbed ApoE on LNP and LDL receptors on hepatocytes. To realize organ-specific drug delivery, the fifth component SORT lipid (DOTAP, 18PA, DODAP) was added to the prescription of LNP. By changing the SORT lipid with different charges or adjusting the percent of SORT lipid, organ-specific systemic delivery of LNP can be realized. Briefly, cationic lipid (DOTAP), anionic lipid (18PA), and ionizable lipid (DODAP) help LNP target to lung, spleen, and liver, respectively. Reprinted with permission from ref 72.

Within seconds after intravenous injection, LNP8 appeared in the liver sinusoids and immediately enriched in KC. Approximately 15 min after injection, the siRNA-LNP was observed in hepatocytes and became concentrated in the bile canaliculi (Figure 3D, Movie S1, Table S5, Supplementary Movie). LNP with AF594-siRNA (LNP9, Table 3) showed a similar longitudinal biodistribution as LNP8 (Figure S5A, Movie S2, Supplementary Movie). In contrast to LNP-encapsulated labeled siRNA, free AF647-siRNA (siRNA1, Table 2) was only transiently visible in the hepatic sinusoids with neither enrichment in KC nor hepatocytes (Figure S5B, Movie S3, Supplementary Movie).

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which the LNPs are targeted to the liver hepatocytes is schematized in Figures 10B and  10C. It is caused by the natural binding of the plasma protein ApoE to the PEGylated LNP. Since liver hepatocytes express a high concentration of the ApoE receptor, LNPs decorated with ApoE bind to the hepatocyte surface [Figure 10B]. The resulting ApoE clustering induces internalization by a clathrin- dependent endocytosis mechanism. Inside the endosome, it is postulated that the ionizable DLin-MC3-DMA lipid becomes cationic because of endosomal/lysosomal acidification. This induces endosome breakage, for which two different mechanisms have been proposed. 1) In the first one, the ionizable lipid captures and titrates the H+ ions taken up into the endosomes by the endolysosomal proton pump ATPase. This induces the sustained uptake of a large number of protons and chloride anions which diffuse into the endosomes to equilibrate the proton cationic charges. This \"proton sponge\" effect induces endosome swelling and breakage. \n\n2) According to the alternative proposed mechanism, the ionizable DLin-MC3-DMA lipid at the LNP surface becomes cationic in the acidic endosomal compartment, leading to the fusion of the positively charged LNP surface with the negatively charged endosome membrane. \n\nBoth postulated mechanisms result in siRNA release into the cytosol and further interaction with the RISC complex. \n\nPatisiran was granted orphan drug status, fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation due to its novel mechanism and the rarity of the condition it is treating. It was approved for medical use in USA ad EU in August 2018. However, with the development of other transthyretin amyloidosis treatments, such as Inotersen and Vutrisiran which is accumulated into the liver through a triGalNac N-acetylglycosamine targeting moiety, there is now intense competition between these different RNA drugs.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "To examine the hypothesis that internal charge adjustment could mediate tissue-specific delivery, we conceived a strategy to add a 5 th molecule to established LNP compositions with validated efficacy in liver hepatocytes. The rationale was to tune efficacious LNP formulations without destroying the core 4-component ratios that are essential for mediating RNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. 26,27  first examined the effect of adding a permanently cationic lipid (defined as positively charged without pKa or pKa >8) to a degradable dendrimer ionizable (pKa <8) cationic lipid 5A2-SC8 formulation named mDLNPs, [28][29][30] which effectively delivered fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) mRNA to liver hepatocytes and extended survival in FAH knockout mice. 27 This initial base mDLNP formulation consisted of 5A2-SC8, 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), cholesterol, DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3, mol/mol), and mRNA (5A2-SC8/mRNA, 20/1, wt/wt) (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then formed a series of LNPs by systematically increasing the percentage of additional permanently cationic lipid from 5 to 100% of total lipids (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). We focused herein on lipids as SORT molecules to aid self-assembly, and initially selected 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) because it is a well-known quaternary amino lipid and prepared a titrated series of 5-component formulations (Supplementary Fig. 1). \n\nWe then evaluated the effects of SORT modification by delivering Luciferase (Luc) mRNA intravenously (IV) at dose of 0.1 mg/kg.",

            "text": "Polymers are the most common LNP surface modifiers. Their unique structures impart special functions to carriers, such as increased residence time in the body and targeting ability [117,118]. PEGylation is a surface modification strategy used to improve the bioavailability of various LNP-based DDSs by modifying polyethylene glycol (PEG)attached membrane lipids (Figure 5A) [136]. PEG has dissolution properties in water and polymers and is harmless to the human body because it is non-antigenic [137]. The PEGylated carriers become stealth from the reticuloendothelial system (RES), increasing persistence in the body and inducing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which imparts the passive targeting ability of tumor cells [119,120]. Liu et al. [32] reported that the amphiphilicity of PEG could increase the drug release rate by reducing the surface tension of LNPs. Moreover, LNP surface modification using PEGylated lipids forms a polymer layer on the exterior membrane to improve the membrane stability and prevent nanoparticle aggregation [121,138]. \n\nVarious DDS studies have demonstrated the enhanced drug delivery efficiency by PE-Gylation in LNPs. Yuan et al. [122] evaluated the bioavailability enhancement of PEGylation after the oral administration of SLNs. According to this study, PEGylated-SLNs (PEG-SLNs) increase penetration into the mimetic intestinal epithelial cell (Caco-2/HT29) monolayer and displays a higher stability in simulated intestinal fluid (Figure 5B). In addition, pharmacokinetic studies have revealed that SLN bioavailability changes approximately two-fold via PEGylation. In PEGylated LNPs (PEG-LNPs), the oral absorption rate of fenofibrate is increased. Furthermore, simulated lipolysis in digestive fluid has suggested that PE-Gylation resists the degradation of LNPs from lipase [140]. Additionally, the stability of PEG-LNPs is maintained even under bile acid exposure conditions [141]. The notable functional improvement via LNP PEGlyation has also been studied in injectable formulations.",

            "text": "They also considered that gene delivery requires endosomal escape to function in the cytoplasm, so they designed an iPhos phospholipid consisting of an ionizable amine head and three alkyl chains as a tail, based on the ability to specifically deliver to extrahepatic tissues, from which the LNP can effectively achieve organ-selective delivery and endosomal escape in target cells, with an in vivo efficiency of up to 965-fold compared to conventional LNP [84]. \n\nFollowing this, Dilliard et al. further analyzed the specific mechanism by which SORT-LNP breaks through the hepatic accumulation limit to achieve organ-tissue specific targeting [124]. This helped to drive the optimization of SORT-LNP for therapeutic applications in tissues and organs such as lung, liver, and spleen, greatly expanding the scope of mRNA vaccines and drugs as well as CRISPR gene editing therapies. This study found that the chemistry of the added SORT molecule controlled the organ-level biodistribution, acid dissociation constant (pKa), and serum protein adsorption of SORT-LNP. Specifically, PEGylated lipids dissociate from the LNP surface and expose SORT molecules, different serum proteins recognize the exposed SORT molecules and adsorb to the LNP surface, and surface-adsorbed proteins interact with cellexpressed cognate receptors in target organs to facilitate mRNA delivery to these tissues (Figure 10(b)). These findings establish a critical link between the molecular composition of SORT-LNP and its unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that recruitment of specific proteins to the LNP surface can enable targeted delivery outside the liver. The results of this study suggest that endogenous targeting, that is, tuning the molecular composition of nanoparticles to bind to specific proteins in the serum so that they can be delivered to the target site may be an effective strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of nanocarriers.",

            "text": "The design and selection of organ-targeted LNPs should primarily prioritize effectiveness, stability, and safety. This is achieved by adjusting their physicochemical properties, including charge, size, pKa, etc. Besides, fine variations in the IL structure within LNPs, rather than relying on charge or ligand modifications, alter the overall delivery characteristics and facilitate precise targeting of specific organs and cells. 108 The structure of IL can be divided into three key components: head group, linker, and hydrophobic tail. \n\nThe head group of ILs typically carries a positive charge, which enhances the encapsulation of nucleic acids and promotes intracellular escape by improving interactions with negatively charged endosome membranes. Typical head groups include amines, ranging from primary to quaternary, guanidine, and various heterocyclic groups. 109 It is worth noting that ILs with different head group structures often exhibit varying pKa values. These pKa values determine the surface charge of LNPs and subsequently impact their ability to interact with diverse types of serum proteins, leading to discrepancies in distribution within the body. Notably, studies by Moderna have claimed that LNPs with a pKa range of 6.6-6.9 contribute to the induction of adaptive immune responses in the context of mRNA vaccines. Additionally, an optimal pKa range of 6.2-6.8 has been identified for achieving effective protein expression in the liver following intravenous delivery of LNPs. 110 Regarding organ-selective targeting, LNPs with a pKa range of 6-7 mainly accumulate in the liver. When the pKa exceeds 9, LNPs primarily reach the lungs, while LNPs with a pKa within 2-6 tend to accumulate in the spleen. 42 A study by Dan Peer and colleagues demonstrated that LNPs with piperazine head key lipids exhibited a greater tendency to accumulate in the spleen than in the liver, whereas LNPs with tertiary amine (F) GFP expression in fetal livers 24 h after injection with LNPs A-3.GFP.

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120]. Moreover, successful localization of LNP-siRNAs to the antigen-presenting cells' cytoplasm has been reported [121]. Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA formulations by the RES and ultimately led to enhanced bioavailability of the bioactive RNA, increasing the protein production for mRNA and better silencing for siRNA [105].",

Given its widespread application across various drug modalities and delivery systems, PEGylation remains a cornerstone in the refinement of LNP-based therapeutics. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 32 pivotal role in biodistribution, tissue-specific targeting, and overall therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the molar ratio of lipid components is a critical factor in achieving organspecific delivery and warrants further investigation. In summary, these studies demonstrate that subtle physicochemical modifications of cholesterol, the ionization state of lipids, or alterations in individual lipid components can significantly impact the structural and biological properties of LNPs. Advanced methodologies, such as large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and other cutting-edge techniques, hold great potential for guiding the rational design of LNPs to enhance their therapeutic applications. In addition to PEG-lipids, cholesterol, characterized by its rigidity and hydrophobic nature, integrates into the interstitial spaces of lipid membranes, thereby enhancing the stability of LNPs and facilitating their fusion with endosomes [60,61]. Notably, structural modifications of cholesterol can further optimize LNP performance and enable specialized functions. For example, Paunovska et al. demonstrated that esterified cholesterol in LNPs significantly boosted delivery efficiency [62]. Recent research has concentrated on enhancing cholesterol derivatives to optimize LNP performance. These modified cholesterol compounds contribute to the improved stability and prolonged circulation times of LNPs, thereby increasing their delivery efficiency. Choi et al. also achieved a boost in delivery efficiency, though through a distinct approach. Instead of using traditional cholesterol, they employed 3\u03b2-L-histidinamide-carbamoyl cholesterol (Hchol), which demonstrated superior delivery and gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement was attributed to the pH-sensitive protonation of the imidazole groups in the Hchol formulation [63]. Additionally, the modification of cholesterol's charge is crucial for targeting.",

In a recent study, two lipids, YSK05 and YSK12-C4 (pK a values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively), were mixed in different ratios to produce LNPs with different pK a values. LNPs with a pK a value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (approx. 36% cationic charge) could successfully deliver siRNA to LSECs. On the other hand, LNPs with a pK a value of 6.50 showed maximum gene silencing in hepatocytes. 76) ne important issue to be considered is the toxicity of LNPs based on ionizable lipids used for gene delivery to hepatocytes. The intravenous injection of these LNPs produces various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, several methods were examined to decrease the toxicity of these LNPs. One strategy is based on using biodegradable derivatives of commonly used lipids. A biodegradable version of MC3, called L319, was less efficient in siRNA delivery (IC 50 value of 0.01 mg/kg) but showed an improved safety profile compared with the nonbiodegradable derivative. 77) Similarly, the biodegradability of the CL4H6 lipid increased its tolerability and biosafety compared with the previous generations. 40)  second strategy is based on decreasing the amount of ionizable lipids. This was generally associated with decreased efficiency. The use of protamine for neutralizing the siRNA was used to restore the high efficiency of LNPs prepared with low amounts of ionizable lipids. 78) It was reported that the liver toxicity of injected LNPs is related to the accumulation in LSECs, resulting in an elevation of inflammatory cytokines. 79) Therefore, a third strategy to decrease hepatotoxicity was based on decreasing the delivery to LSECs using ligands for active targeting to hepatocytes.",

The PEGylated lipids (PEG 2000 -C-DMG) are conjugated with short anchors to the NP lipid membrane, which allows for their redistribution from the NP surface in the surrounding environment and exposure of the ionizable lipids at the surface of the LNPs. After dissociation of the PEGylated lipids, the naked surface of the particles containing the ionizable DLin-KC2-DMA, which is neutral in a biological environment, interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), enabling ApoE liver-mediated targeting. Transient PEGylation facilitates not only the localization and interaction with the target cell but also improves ion pair formation between the ionizable lipid (which will become cationic at pH 4) and the anionic endogenous endosomal phospholipids. This will enable the fast release of the payload into the cytoplasm and efficacious transfection [142][143][144][145][146][147][148]. Besides the efforts for liver and liver hepatocyte targeting, different research groups are working on the challenge of developing lipid nanoparticles for specific organ targeting after IV administration, including lipid nanoparticles for lung targeting or targeting relevant cell types, that is, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells of the lungs, B cells, and T cells.",

Ionizable lipids contribute to efficient endosomal escape and release of nucleic acids and mRNAs from LNPs after uptake by cells, in addition to the encapsulation of nucleic acids and mRNAs into LNPs. The LNPs modified with 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG) can detach PEG at a moderate rate in the blood circulation, resulting in efficient intracellular delivery of nucleic acids and mRNAs.

Interestingly, the duration of mRNA translation varied among organs and tissues. It rapidly declined in the liver, while intramuscular and intradermal mRNA translation tended to be relatively persistent, and was observed for up to a week. Intranasal administration was also evaluated using a similar approach in another paper, which reported no mRNA translation [35], although it may vary with administration technique and condition. Recently, luciferin analogs generating near-infrared luminescence were developed [36,37]. The increasing sensitivity of luminescence imaging may, for example, make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of exogenous protein expression in deeper organs and tissues with lower levels of protein expression. The high and specific uptake of LNPs in the liver, especially in the hepatocytes, after this intravenous administration, was shown to be caused via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) because of the strong interaction between LNPs and apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the blood ( Fig. 1) [",

Basically, the intrahepatic activity of YSK05/12-LNPs was compared with that of the original YSK05-or YSK12-C4-LNPs (the pKa values for all these preparations are shown in Figure 3). The formulation that induced the strongest knockdown activity in hepatocytes was YSK05-LNP (pKa 6.50), while the activities for the YSK05/12-LNPs and YSK12-C4-LNP, which have higher pKa values, were considerably lower (Figure 5A). A possible reason behind the hepatocyte uptake of YSK05-LNP might be related to the fact that hepatocytes preferentially take up neutral particles with lower pKa values through the apolipoprotein E-low density lipoprotein receptor pathway, and this coincides with previous reports. 32,43 On the other hand, in LSECs, despite the weak activity of both YSK05and YSK12-C4-LNPs, using mixtures in YSK05/12-LNP dramatically improved their activity in LSECs as the result of optimizing the pKa value for the LNP membrane to 7.15 (Figure 5B). A possible reason behind this is the preference of endothelial cells to take up slightly cationic particles which electrostatically interact with the slightly anionic charge of the endothelial membrane. \n\nThe YSK05/12-LNP formulation which is composed of YSK05/YSK12-C4/cholesterol/ m PEG 2k -DMG (50:20:30:2 mol%) and a pKa value of 7.15 was chosen for use in experiments to target LSECs and compared with YSK05-LNP.",

The LNPs with optimal pK a (approx. 6.4) values for gene silencing activity in hepatocytes naturally accumulated in hepatocytes but also were substantially co-localized with LSECs. The LNPs with pK a values of 6.8 specifically accumulated in LSECs. Gene silencing activity in LSECs was examined using siRNA targeting CD31, and a plot of CD31 expression in the liver versus the apparent pK a value of the LNPs clearly showed that gene silencing activity in LSECs was clearly pK adependent and became maximum at pK a values in excess of 7.0 (Fig. 10A). A similar experiment was conducted using a pH-sensitive CL library with different hydrophilic regions, and it was revealed that the optimal pK a range for gene silencing activity in LSECs was from 7.0 to 7.5 (Fig. 10B), which was just 1 unit higher than that in hepatocytes. Although the apparent pK a value of the LNPs can be controlled by the design of chemical structure of the CL as examples of the 2nd generation CLs and CL library, 83,89) precise adjustment of apparent pK a value is somewhat challenging due to time-consuming and labor-intensive processes and is sometimes impossible due to limitations in the permissibility of chemical structure. Therefore, the manipulation of the apparent pK a value of the LNPs using a combination of two pH-sensitive CLs with different apparent pK a values would be an alternative strategy for precisely adjusting apparent pK a to the target values. LNPs composed of both YSK05 and YSK12-C4 (YSK05/12-LNPs) were developed in attempts to achieve new pK a values. 168)",

            "text": "In contrast, cationic particles tended to collect in the liver [115]. Ionizable cationic lipids permit pH-dependent positive charge, meaning the LNP would remain positive in acidic environments but neutral otherwise. This allows a neutral charge in the blood, reducing cytotoxicity, but a positive charge in acidic environments, facilitating nucleic acid interaction and endosomal membrane fusion for cargo release. \n\nPEG-lipid components improve the half-life of circulating LNPs [116], but a high concentration of PEG-lipid in the LNP can impede endocytosis [117]. For this reason, the concentration of PEG-lipid in the LNP is minimized as much as possible; Semple et al. aimed to optimize cationic lipids for siRNA delivery and noted vital findings such as optimal pKa constants for LNPs, and ideal PEG-to-ionizable lipid component ratios [118]. PEG-lipids that can diffuse out of the LNP have also been explored, demonstrating a lengthened circulation time [119][120][121]. In contrast, permanently PEGylated LNPs are more immunogenic, resulting in rapid clearance, an antibody-driven reaction, and reduced potency upon subsequent exposure [122,123]. Besin et al. recently demonstrated that LNP administration in two-week intervals or with wash-out periods between injections significantly reduced blood clearance [124]. Notably, this experiment was done in an animal model with no previous exposure to PEG-lipids; human beings, however, are more likely to have prior exposure to PEG-containing products such as vaccines and common medications. Nonetheless, PEG-lipids that can diffuse from the LNP offer a strategy to reduce immunogenicity and improve half-life without requiring a more intensive administration schedule. \n\nEmpty LNPs (eLNPs), or vehicle-only controls, have been shown to promote proinflammatory IL-6 production and T-follicular helper cell activation in mice [125]. Further studies identified eLNP-mediated maturation and activation of dendritic cells and monocytes, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of cellsignalling pathways [126].",

IRF5 is activated by TLR-MyD88 signaling pathways. 35,51 3][54][55] In addition, Con A-induced TNF-a expression in macrophages is downregulated in MyD88-deficient mice. 53 It is well known that damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are released from cells undergoing necrotic cell death, and then recognized by TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors. 56 Liver macrophages can sense DAMPs, thereby producing inflammatory cytokines. 57 From these reports and our results, we speculate that Con A administration induces the release of DAMPs from hepatocytes, activating the TLR-MyD88-IRF5 signaling cascade in liver macrophages. \n\nFurther modifications to the biodegradable LNPs may allow them to be more efficiently incorporated into macrophages and other immune cell populations. LNPs larger than 200 nm in diameter are more readily taken up by peritoneal macrophages compared to smaller LNPs. 58 As the size of our LNPs is approximately 70-80 nm (see Figure S1), increasing their size might further improve the efficacy. In addition, mannosylated LNPs are effectively incorporated into mannose receptor-expressing macrophages such as tumor-associated macrophages. 59 LNPs coated with antibodies targeting DEC205 and CD4 were capable of efficiently delivering siRNA to a dendritic cell subpopulation and CD4 + T cells in mice, respectively. 60,61 Such modifications could improve the efficiency and versatility of our LNPs and extend their potential applications for clinical use in the future.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

However, our data indicate a marked disparity in the efficacy of the nanoparticles used in these studies. LNP B provided much greater delivery of ARG1 mRNA to hepatocytes in vivo, resulting in higher arginase hepatic protein (as demonstrated by western blot and functional arginase activity) and greater improvement in control of ammonia, arginase, and guanidino compounds along with a more pronounced effect on quantitative myelination of the cingulum bundle and striatum. It is not clear why LNP A was markedly less efficient than LNP B in hepatocyte mRNA uptake and functional activity for both luciferase and arginase 1. While LNP A is efficient at expressing luciferase protein in muscle/peritoneum near the site of injection, previous investigations have demonstrated that arginase expression in myocytes is ineffective in extending survival and successfully treating arginase deficiency in mice. 43 The studies described in Figure 1 did demonstrate exposure of the luciferase mRNA-formulated LNP in extrahepatic tissues; however, outside of the liver for LNP B and the muscle at the site of the injection for LNP A, these were at a low level or modest at best. Very low levels were detected in the brain, with slightly more modest levels detected in the heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. These extra",

In particular, mannose receptors (CD206) have been attracting attention because they are expressed on immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on vascular endothelial cells [90]. Applying this strategy, an attempt to modify the cell selectivity in the liver by mannose modification was also reported in LNPs [49]. The pharmacokinetics of general LNPs is determined by the formation of protein corona especially after systemic administration, as described above. To make active targeting dominant, it is necessary to inhibit the formation of protein corona. It has been reported that increasing the amount of PEG-lipids reduced the interaction with ApoE and the LDLR-mediated delivery to hepatocytes. Therefore, in the LNPs based on ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, the amount of PEG-lipid was increased to 3%, which is higher than general LNPs, and 2.5% of it was replaced with mannose-modified PEG-lipid. In the evaluation of firefly luciferase mRNA as a reporter, the mannose modification of LNPs did not change the liver-specific protein expression. The cellular pattern of protein expression in the liver, however, changed significantly in an evaluation using LSL-tdTomato mice. In the original LNPs, the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells was~70% for hepatocytes,~10% for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and~5% for Kupffer cells; in the mannose-modified LNPs, the percentage was~15% for hepatocytes,~70% for LSECs, and~15% for Kupffer cells.

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

            "text": "Improvements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

Hepatic sinusoids contain numerous fenestration structures approximately 100 nm in diameter [8].Thus, the size of the LNP needs to be smaller than this value.Note that the diameter of chylomicron, a dietary lipid droplet taken up by the intestine, is 100-1000 nm; hence, these are too large to be incorporated by the hepatocytes.In contrast, adeno-associated viruses (AAV) has an approximately 25 nm diameter; therefore, even if non-liver directed serotypes are chosen, the hepatotoxicity of AAV may become incidentally apparent.\n\nLastly, some previously used liposomal components are derived from naturally occurring lipids such as those originating in soy and eggs.These may contain a variety of analogs with different chain lengths and numbers of double bonds as well as isomers with different stereo-and regio-configurations.This composition may vary depending on the source of origin, diet, and even the season of harvest.To eliminate these factors, currently used lipids for LNPs are highly pure.",

This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo.",

            "text": "They tested the delivery of LNP libraries in vivo based on the translation of Cre mRNA to Cre protein and isolation of fluorescent cells where targeted DNA was edited by Cre protein. This approach resulted in the identification of two novel LNPs that efficiently deliver mRNA to endothelial cells [147]. This study showed the importance of optimization of LNP composition not only for improvements in efficacy but also as a path for identifying LNPs with new tropisms. \n\nStealth lipids such as PEG-lipid are necessary for increased half-life and stability of the LNP particle and influence its physicochemical properties. After LNP-mRNA administration to the blood, LNP adsorbs on its surface numerous proteins forming \"protein corona\" (reviewed in [63,148]). Among others, these proteins include albumin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, and complement proteins [149]. PEG-lipids-shielding lowers the interaction of LNP with complement and other proteins lowering the internalization of LNP-mRNAs by macrophages increasing circulation time of LNP-mRNA in the blood. In addition, PEG-lipids-shielding has impact against undesired aggregation and accumulation in filtering organs that might be caused by protein corona [148]. However, PEG-shielding may also lower the recognition of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and it can cause the formation of anti-PEG ADAs that lead to lowering the efficiency of the LNP [60,150]. Thus, the level of PEG-shielding must be optimized to obtain a compromise between efficacy and safety. With regard to anti-PEG ADAs formation, a recent study by Suzuki et al. examined PEG-containing LNP-siRNA in mice and found that LNPs with a fast-shedding PEG-lipid (short acyl chain) induced less anti-PEG IgM compared with those with long acyl chain LNPs [60]. The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60].",

The uptake of LNPs was tracked using 3 H-labeled DSPC as a marker. Although there was no significant size-dependent difference in LNP uptake in hepatocytes, adipocytes exhibited slight variations in uptake based on particle size. In adipocytes, LNPs with a number average diameter of \u223c65 nm were taken up more readily compared with smaller and larger average-sized LNPs ( Fig. 1 A and D). Furthermore, we found that LNP uptake was initiated almost instantaneously (within the first hour) following dosing with the uptake kinetics displaying a plateau after 24 h in adipocytes, whereas in hepatocytes the plateau was reached already after 8 h ( Fig. 1 A and D). We also observed that although not all LNPs were taken up, about 50% were located intracellularly 48 h postdosing, measured by the disappearance of the 3 H-DSPC radioactivity from the extracellular medium, irrespective of particle size or cell type ( Fig. 1 A and D).\n\nThe kinetic data show that no hEPO was detected before 8 h in any of the cell types, independently of LNP size ( Fig. 1 B and E); however, LNPs with a number average diameter of \u223c65 nm (1.5 mol % of DMPE-PEG 2000 ) showed significant hEPO production ( Fig. 1 B, C, E, and F) after 20 h.

These results support that developing nanocarriers for the delivery of nonviral vectors has the potential for markedly improving the therapeutic efficacy of endogenously delivered mRNA. \n\nA key challenge facing the use of LNPs for mRNA delivery lies in that LNPs are mainly confined to hepatocytes, and a lack of cell or organ specificity limits their application (Loughrey and Dahlman, 2022). mRNA taken up by hepatocytes is robustly cleared from the liver, highlighting the importance of improving mRNA delivery to non-liver tissues for systemic mRNA therapy. For Fabry disease, kidney, heart, and CNS are suffering severe pathologies. Therefore, organ targeting and selectiveness are of critically importance for effective mRNA therapy (Knott et al., 2019). To satisfy such demand, LNPbased systems that specifically transport mRNA to specific tissues or organs are urgently demanded. Various LNPs with structural features and biological properties have been developed for organ-targeted mRNA delivery (Li et al., 2019). Notably, LNPs can be modified with various targeting ligands, including active targeting ligands and stimuli-responsive groups. For example, LNPs with RGD modifications can precisely bind vascular endothelial cells, thus improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing off-targeted effects. Moreover, specific organ-targeting LNPs have been developed to facilitate precise mRNA delivery to different organs for treatment (Dilliard et al., 2021;Qiu et al., 2022).",

Leveraging liver biodistribution, Onpattro\u00ae LNPs (ionizable lipid = MC3 with noncleavable lipid tails) are designed to treat liver hATTR amyloidosis [123,176]. The high liver accumulation of MC3 LNPs sparks the development of ionizable lipids with cleavable ester tails. Ester lipid tails have been used in clinically approved SM-102, ALC-0315 ionizable lipids, and many other structural derivatives sharing liver biodistributions for improving the biodegradability of ionizable lipids in liver [177]. On the lipidoid side, the classic lipidoid 5-tail piperazine-based C12-200 is known to target both liver and spleen when given intravenously [177]. The 4-tail piperazine-based 246C10, however, showed liver-only distribution in a CRISPR/Cas gene editing study targeting antithrombin (mAT) for treating hemophilia [11]. With 2 extra carbons in the lipid chain in 246C10, LNPs based on piperazine-based IC8 (246C12) were shown to distribute to the liver and spleen when delivering mRNA encoding B7H3 \u00d7 CD3 bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) antibodies. The liver was targeted as an in vivo antibody factory for BiTEs expression and secretion to treat hematologic malignancies and melanoma [178]. LNPs based on modified diketopiperazine (DKP)-based lipidoids, e.g., cKK-E12 (non-cleavable saturated tails) and OF-02 (non-cleavable unsaturated tails), showed a highly liver-focused distribution with higher protein translation efficiency by OF-02 compared to cKK-E12 [153].",

LNPs are clinically proven and the most widely used carriers for delivering oligonucleotide drugs. Composed of four components-ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids-LNPs form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged nucleic acids [34,47]. However, one major limitation of LNP delivery is their tendency to accumulate in the liver [48]. To improve the intratumoral accumulation of siRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs were functionalized with the peptide tLyp-1 (truncated Lyp-1) to target pancreatic cancer cells. When injected intravenously into mice bearing pancreatic tumors, the treatment using LNPs in combination with gemcitabine resulted in reduced tumor size and the downregulation of KRAS and phospho-ERK [40]. This highlights that the application of LNPs is not limited to liver-associated diseases and immunotherapy but is viable for developing siRNA-based therapies for KRAS mutant tumors [49]. \n\nFurthermore, various platforms for siKRAS delivery systems have been tested in preclinical settings, including cRGD peptide-modified bioresponsive chimeric polymersomes and aerosol inhalation nanoparticles (siKRAS@GCLPP NP) [50,51].",

A review by D'Alessio et al. 41 discussed how LNPs can be used for liver-targeted gene therapy in inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs). By naturally accumulating in the liver, LNPs deliver therapeutic mRNA and gene-editing components directly to hepatocytes, helping to detoxify harmful metabolites and address enzyme deficiencies associated with these conditions. This detoxification occurs through the correction of enzyme deficiencies, enabling hepatocytes to process and eliminate toxic substrates that would otherwise accumulate and cause systemic damage.",

At the same time, the physical characteristics of LNPs, like particle size, morphology, encapsulation rate, and surface charge are prone to be regulated, thus producing a variety of different LNP formulations (Yang et al., 2022;Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). Ionizable lipid nanoparticles display excellent biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, and efficient transfection performance, releasing only under specific circumstances with low off-target effects (Yang et al., 2022). Nowadays, LNPs have become the most widely explored and applied non-viral nucleic acid delivery vector (Sun and Lu, 2023). Now the focus is on how to improve the delivery effect of LNPs. Modifying the surface of LNPs with targeted molecular entities becomes the most popular way (Subhan et al., 2023). In principle, peptides, antibodies, or proteins that target specific cell surface molecules are added to nanoparticles carrying mRNA to block liver accumulation and enable particular mRNA transport to target cells through high-affinity binding (Kedmi et al., 2018;FIGURE 4 The Delivery mechanism of lipid nanoparticles (Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). First, the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) completely encapsulated the RNA and prevented it from nuclease digestion. LNPs are neutral in physiological pH due to ionizable lipids and pegylated phospholipids, thus reducing non-specific interactions with serum proteins. Second, LNPs are taken up by cells via apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent and/or ApoE independent pathways when the pegylated phospholipids are dissociated. Finally, the protonated LNPs, after acidification in the endosomes, induce the hexagonal phase structure, destroy the cell membrane, and release RNA molecules into the cytoplasm. Yang et al., 2022).",

            "text": "an intermediate near-neutral net charge [153]. Consistent with the above findings, highly positive LNPs targeted the lungs and highly negative LNPs targeted the spleen, while intermediate charge levels predominantly targeted the liver. Liver targeting has been shown to depend on Apo-E binding to near-neutral liposomes or LNPs [154], which does not occur for negatively charged liposomes [155].\n\nNotably, all of the above charge-mediated targeting studies have been done using IV administration and the routes typically used for vaccination, such as the intramuscular or intradermal routes, have not been examined. Most studies that analyze expression after intramuscular injection do, however, detect the systemic trafficking of mRNA LNPs, which are rapidly and strongly expressed in the liver, at the same time as they are expressed in muscle and draining lymph nodes [97,156,157]. These particular LNPs therefore seem to enter the vasculature and are subsequently expressed in liver hepatocytes due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting, which is not surprising since they were designed for hepatocyte targeting. This systemic distribution and expression of immunogens could, however, generate systemic cytokines, complement activation and lead to other potential undesirable effects that could amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events and/or impair immune response generation. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with ligand-mediated targeting of LNPs. Lung endothelial cell targeting was achieved by conjugating CD31 (PECAM) antibodies to the LNP and injecting intravascularly [158]. The liver hepatocyte-directed LNP then became largely redirected to the lung. A similar approach using a VCAM ligand successfully targeted LNPs to inflamed regions of the brain and alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [159]. Dendritic cells in vitro were also more efficiently transfected using a mannosylated liposome, which may be a strategy applicable to vaccination [160]. Higher throughput screening methods to identify ligands targeting specific cell types have also been developed and may be applicable for the targeting of specific dendritic cell subsets [161",

For example, Daniel J.'s group [149] reported a strategy termed Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) that allowed accurate delivery of diverse cargoes including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to the lungs, spleens and livers following intravenous (i.v.) administration through incorporation of differentially charged phospholipids into the LNP formulation. (Fig. 9A). The results found that with an increasing molar percentage of permanent cationic lipid SORT moleculSes DOTAP, the resulting LNP moved progressively from liver to spleen, and then to lung, demonstrating a clear and precise organ-specific delivery trend. When added 50% of DOTAP into the formulations, 80% of the LNPs accumulated in lung. Whereas with the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipid SORT molecules (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 18PA), LNPs mediated completely selective delivery to the spleen. With the addition of ionizable cationic lipid (1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammoniumpropane, DODAP), the LNPs significantly enhanced liver delivery > tenfold at 20% incorporation and transfected ~93% of hepatocytes. The results suggested that altering the internal and/or external charges of NPs may be a key and universal strategy in tuning tissue tropism. In addition, determining the precise mechanisms that explain how SORT enables tissue targeting will be the next research point.\n\nIn a follow-up to this study, Daniel J. et al. [153] synthesized a library of zwitterion ionizable phospholipids, termed \"iPhos\", which consist of one ionizable amino group and one phosphate head group with three hydrophobic lipid tails.

During screening, researchers discovered PPZ-A10, a lipid with shorter C10 carbon chains. They incorporated PPZ-A10, along with cholesterol, C18PEG2K, and DOPE, to create LNPs for efficient mRNA delivery to Kupffer cells. 160 Furthermore, a range of vector optimized strategies have been developed with the specific aim of improving the targeted delivery to liver parenchymal cells. A delivery vector designed by Finn et al. 161 achieved significant hepatic editing, with around 70% effectiveness at the mouse thyroxine transfer protein gene locus. This editing reached most hepatocytes in the mouse liver, including GS+ pericentral cells. 161 In another example, the reducible LNPs composed of disulfide bondcontaining hydrophobic tails have been screened for delivering Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to hepatocytes to promote proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) knockdown. 162,163 There was a design of LNPs targeting the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) that enhanced mRNA expression in the liver, especially in RES cell types. 164 Such targeting approaches hold potential for ameliorating liver-related disorders by modulating specific cellular responses, thereby minimizing off-target effects and fostering therapeutic efficacy. \n\nUsing ligands to actively target delivery vectors to the liver and other organs of interest is a potential research area.",

            "text": "The accumulation of polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated LNP (PEG-LNP) and RGD-LNP in the lung was compared by CLSM 1, at 3 and 7 days after implantation. PEG-LNP levels in the lung tissue were negligible. On the other hand, a larger amount of the RGD-LNP was delivered to the lung vasculature ( Figure 2A). The accumulation of RGD-LNP per cancer cell was much higher than that for the PEG-LNP ( Figure 2B). An overall observation of lung also showed that RGD-LNP was superior to PEG-LNP in terms of the amount that had accumulated ( Figure 2C). When radioisotopically (RI)labeled LNPs were systemically administered to tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein, the accumulation of RGD-LNP was found to be 1.9-fold higher than that for PEG-LNP at day 7 ( Figure 2D). The amount of PEG-LNP that accumulated increased slightly with time, suggesting that vascular permeability contributed slightly to the EPR effect-based delivery of the PEG-LNP in the metastasized lung. However, the effect of vascular permeability on the accumulation of the PEG-LNP appeared to be marginal. Further, the fact that accumulation was independent of the number of post-implantation days on the accumulation of the particles in the liver suggest that this slight increase in the accumulation of PEG-LNP can, in part, be attributed to vascular permeability in the metastasis lung ( Figure S2). At the same time, this result suggests that the vascular permeability is a minor factor in the accumulation of nanoparticles in the metastasis lung, at least in the case of this particular experimental lung metastasis model. Maeda 18 previously reported that Evans Blue, a dye that binds to albumin and is then delivered to a primary tumor via the EPR effect, 22,23 was also delivered to a lung metastasis site. Although we also observed the accumulation of Evans Blue dye at the metastasis site ( Figure S3A), the amount of Evans Blue in the whole lung did not appear to be increased significantly",

Later, they changed the PEG lipid content of the LNPs (0.25-3%) and prepared LNP@mRNA containing human erythropoietin (hEPO) at 45-135 nm [121]. However, there were only slight differences in the cellular uptake for different LNP particle sizes; 65 nm LNPs expressed the highest hEPO in hepatocytes and adipocytes in vitro. \n\nAdditionally, Moderna's study showed that although LNP particle sizes of around 100 nm produced consistently high antibody titers in mouse immunization experiments, which meant a lower immunogenicity, curiously, in non-human primates all of the tested LNPs produced robust immune responses at particle sizes of 60-150 nm [122]. These studies demonstrated the important effect of the particle size on efficacy. However, as mentioned above, changing the percentage content of PEG lipids had a strong effect on the course of the particles in vivo, in which introduced an additional variable for screening. Overall, these conflicting results regarding the optimal LNP size suggest that multiple factors may contribute to efficient LNP-mediated RNA delivery, including the LNP composition, PEG lipid content, etc. Therefore, further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate this size-activity relationship.",

Cheng et al. (40) demonstrated that formulating LNPs with helper lipids of different charges enabled tissue-specific mRNA delivery following intravenous injection. On the basis of this, we hypothesized that modulating helper lipid chemistry and charge would facilitate potent and specific mRNA delivery to the pancreas. To examine this hypothesis, we used the three previous ionizable lipids to create nine additional LNP formulations. Each formulation contained a differently charged helper lipid constituting 40% of the total amount of lipid (structures shown in fig. S2). Specifically, we formulated LNPs with either the zwitterionic helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), the anionic helper lipid L-\u03b1-phosphati- dylserine (PS), or the cationic helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP). LNPs containing these helper lipids and mLuc were delivered to C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection. Three hours later, the mice were euthanized, and their organs were analyzed for luminescent signal ex vivo using IVIS (Fig. 2). \n\nFor each lipidoid, the three different helper lipids produced roughly equivalent signal in the pancreas (Fig. 2). However, the cationic helper lipid DOTAP most effectively reduced off-target luciferase expression in the liver and spleen for all lipidoids. To confirm that this result depends on the presence of ionizable lipid rather than the cationic property of DOTAP alone, we compared the performance of 306O i10 and DOTAP LNPs with that of DOTAP LNPs lacking ionizable lipid.",

The authors believe that the next successful use of mRNA vaccines is to be expected because LNPs are widely used in nucleic acid delivery research and clinical applications, and nearly 80 kinds of nucleic acid drugs based on LNPs have entered the clinical stage. 30 Although some clinical data are still available after approval and emergency use authorization (EUA) are obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), LNPs still have many problems that cannot be bypassed. There are several obstacles inside and outside the cells that prevent the application of mRNA LNPs within a wide range. Liver enrichment is a common phenomenon in the mouths of LNP patients. LNPs require some effort to pass through the liver system, and nanoparticles must first be isolated from Kupffer cells (which are macrophages resident in the liver). Kupffer cells in the liver can absorb LNPs of different sizes. In addition, LNPs also interact with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) to prevent LNPs from passing through the liver system (Figure 2). 31 A total of 30\u221290% of these drugs are concentrated in the liver, which leads to drug deviation during nonliver-targeted administration, 32 thus affecting the therapeu-tic efficacy.",

[178] developed a nucleoside-modified mRNA (LNP@mRNA) wrapped by LNP, which transiently and stably expressed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in mouse hepatocytes. Meanwhile, they confirmed the specific hepatic targeting of LNP@mRNA by intravenous injection of LNP@mRNA encoding firefly luciferase, which resulted in the stable expression of protein levels for about 3 d. In addition, HGF LNP@mRNA can effectively induce hepatocyte proliferation. In a mouse model of chronic liver injury with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and a mouse model of acute liver injury induced by acetaminophen, the injection of HGF and EGF LNP@mRNA significantly reversed steatosis, rapidly activated regenerative pathways in hepatocytes, and accelerated the recovery of liver function after injury. Therefore, LNP@mRNA is an ideal therapeutic strategy to activate the regenerative pathway of hepatocytes for the treatment of multiple causes of liver injury in a short period of time.",

            "text": "Thus, across the three screens, we formulated 144 LNPs and injected 137 LNPs. Four days later, we sacrificed mice and quantified the percentage of tdTomato + cells for 19 cell types, using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice as tdTomato gating controls (Figure S3b). As a sequencing control, we included a DNA barcode that was not encapsulated in an LNP. This barcode should be delivered into cells less efficiently than barcodes carried in LNPs. As expected, unencapsulated barcodes were delivered inefficiently (Figures 2b and S4). Relative to PBS-treated mice, mice treated with LNPs did not lose weight (Figure S5). \n\nWe then quantified mRNA delivery as a function of helper lipid charge in five lung cell types (Figure 2c). Lung cells in mice treated with cationic LNPs became tdTomato + ; lung cells in mice treated with neutral or anionic LNPs did not (Figure 2c). In cationic LNP-treated mice, we observed over 50% tdTomato + lung endothelial cells (ECs). Between 10% and 25% of the lung dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, B cells, and monocytes were tdTomato + , suggesting that the LNPs first targeted the endothelial cells, which are accessible from the bloodstream, and then targeted less accessible cells. In contrast, LNPs containing neutral or anionic helper lipids did not lead to measurable lung mRNA delivery but did lead to liver delivery (Figure 2d). In the spleen, heart, and kidney, we observed delivery, albeit at lower levels (Figure 2e\u2212g). These data suggest that cationic helper lipid charge within fourcomponent LNPs can increase the lung:liver delivery ratio. We observed no relationship between LNP hydrodynamic diameter and delivery (Figure 2h). \n\nWe used the barcoding readout to identify relationships between lipid structure and in vivo delivery (Figure S6). First, we explored whether helper lipid molar ratio affected LNP normalized delivery.",

Preclinical studies determined that LNP with diffusible PEG-lipids rapidly accumulate in the liver, with circulation half-lives of less than 15 minutes 62,73 . This rapid accumulation and potency for hepatocyte transfection stemmed from ApoE adsorption. \n\nLNP\u2212siRNA manufacturing required a rapid, reproducible procedure. This was accomplished through an ethanol-loading technique that involved mixing preformed LNP (at pH 4) with nucleic acids in the presence of high ethanol concentrations (~40% v/v) 74 . A subsequently developed higher-throughput rapid mixing process combined lipids dissolved in ethanol with nucleic acids in an aqueous buffer (pH 4) through a T-junction, resulting in efficient nucleic acid loading into LNP systems 75 . Rapid-mixing techniques produced LNP\u2212 siRNA systems with high entrapment efficiencies (>85%) and narrow size distributions. Recent work suggests that such structures include a hydrophobic oil core primarily consisting of neutral ionizable lipid surrounded by siRNA complexed to lipids in a bilayer arrangement 76 with heterogeneity in the siRNA copy number per particle 77 . \n\nClinical example.

Using stealth-based nanomaterials is a common strategy for enhancing the stability and prolonging the circulation duration of mRNA molecules [40]. In this context, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) emerges as the gold standard for nanoparticle formation due to the hydrophilic nature of PEG, low cellular toxicity, and high biocompatibility [41]. The concept of PEGylation encompasses the modification of biological molecules through covalent conjugation with PEG. PEGylation modifies the physical and chemical properties of the mRNA compounds, including their conformation, electrostatic binding, and hydrophobicity [42]. This modification results A few parameters of the PEG-Lipids can be adjusted to improve the encapsulation efficiency. For example, the amount of PEG is inversely proportional to the size of the LNP, hence, the higher the PEG content, the smaller the size of the LNP. A higher molecular weight of PEG and a longer lipid chain can increase the circulation time of the LNPs in the biological system.",

            "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively re-evaluated these lipids, selecting the screened candidates that yielded LNPs with physicochemical properties deviating from the liver-targeting norms. We specifically focused on the zeta potential as this reflects the overall surface charge, which can influence interactions with serum proteins, the biodistribution, and passive organ targeting. \n\nThus, for this selection, we applied two criteria. First, we focused on LNPs with a zeta potential equal to or greater than \u22122 mV, inspired by previous findings that suggested that an increased surface charge could enhance lung targeting [10,12]. Second, we included LNPs that demonstrated strong protein expression, specifically those exceeding a total flux of 1 \u00d7 10 7 p/s in the original intramuscular screening, ensuring that only high-performing candidates were considered (chemical structures can be found in Figure S1). Additionally, we incorporated thirteen lipids that exhibited exceptionally high protein expression despite having more negative zeta potentials, allowing us to explore potential outliers with unique targeting properties (Figure 1B). \n\nAfter intravenous administration of LNPs formulated with the selected ionizable lipids and encapsulating luciferase mRNA, ex vivo analyses revealed that, while most of the selected ionizable lipids still showed liver tropism, eight of them demonstrated lung-selective expression exceeding 10% selectivity (Figure 1C,D).",

While only 4% of fetal HSCs were transfected after untargeted LNP administration, 30% of fetal HSCs were transfected after targeted LNP administration (Fig. 3A). Transfection of CD45+ cells in the fetal liver by targeted LNPs was confirmed on histology (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, when a similar experiment was conducted in adult R26 mT/mG mice, both untargeted and targeted LNPs resulted in strong transfection of the liver but failed to produce discernable genome modulation in adult bone marrow HSCs (Fig. 3C). These results imply that transfection of HSCs via this strategy requires both active targeting to HSCs and the fetal microenvironment, which possesses an accessible and abundant population of these cells. The durability of genome modulation via this approach was subsequently assessed in vivo. Of note, Cre recombinase-mediated excision of the LoxP flanked tdTomato cassette in R26 mT/mG mice results in permanent expression of green fluorescence protein in transfected cells and their progeny. Thus, we injected R26 mT/mG fetuses at E13.5 with untargeted or targeted LNPs encapsulating Cre mRNA at a dose of 1 mg/kg mRNA and harvested liver, bone marrow, and peripheral blood after 4 mo, when these mice had reached adulthood. In concordance with our results at 60 h, both untargeted and targeted LNPs facilitated long-term transfection in 50% of hepatocytes (Fig. 3C). Targeted LNPs mediated long-term genome modulation in 19% of bone marrow HSCs compared to only 4% of bone marrow HSCs in animals treated with untargeted LNPs (Fig. 3D).",

The ionizable lipid is the principal factor determining LNP efficacy [38]. Specific LNPs formulations are often proprietary, but a number of proprietary ionizable lipids incorporated into LNPs were evaluated to determine which maximized the expression of encapsulated mRNA [41]. LNP formulations are often designed based on the target tissue, application, and route of administration. LNPs that incorporate MC3 ionizable lipids, for example, successfully deliver mRNA to hepatocytes after i.v. administration [42,43].

            "text": "LNP-based mRNA therapy is a promising nucleic acid therapy that can target many diseases that are hardly targeted by small molecules. The success of the mRNA vaccine in the COVID-19 pandemic boosts the development of mRNA-loaded LNP for the treatment of many different diseases, including infections, cancer, and genetic disease. The physical properties of LNP, including particle size, morphology, and surface properties, are greatly influenced by lipid structure and composition, and these physical properties will affect the efficacy, safety, and drug distribution of LNP. In this review, we introduce the site-specific LNP for mRNA delivery from three aspects, including LNP that was locally injected, organ-targeted LNP after intravenous injection, and cell-targeted LNP after intravenous injection. \n\nLocal administration of LNP allows the direct interactions between LNP and target tissues or organs. Many routes of administration have been proven to be effective for mRNA delivery by LNP, including oral administration for the treatment of IBD, inhalation for the treatment of H1N1 infection, etc. The advantage of local administration is the high delivery efficiency and low systemic toxicity. However, local injection is difficult to achieve for some diseases such as brain disorders and metastatic tumors. \n\nIn addition to local administration, intravenous injection is widely used for LNP drugs. The first FDA-approved LNP drug Onpattro mainly accumulate in the liver after intravenous injection, which was mediated by the interaction of adsorped ApoE on LNP and LDLR on hepatocytes. To achieve specific delivery of LNP to other organs or cells, a large number of strategies were used, including (1) changing the structure of functionalized lipids, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids; (2) changing the ratio of different lipids in LNP; (3) surface modification after the preparation of LNP. All of these change the distribution of LNPs after intravenous injection by increasing the nonspecific or specific interactions with different target organs or cells. There are still some challenges and problems that remain unsolved. 89 For the first strategy, the structure change of different lipids may introduce unexpected toxicities.",

Given the apparent tropism of the lcLNPs containing 40 mol % ESM for bone marrow and spleen we examined protein expression in both tissues (as well as liver) for Onpattro LNP GFP mRNA and lcLNP GFP mRNA following systemic administration (3 mg mRNA/kg) in mice. Translation of GFP in liver, spleen, and bone marrow was investigated at a cellular level using flow cytometry, the uptake in hepatocytes, splenocytes, and bone marrow cells was assessed using the fluorescence arising from trace levels of DiD. The details regarding gating strategies can be found in the methods. \n\nConsiderable LNP accumulation was observed in hepatocytes for both Onpattro and lcLNP formulations at 4 and 24 h post injection. At 24 h, LNP accumulation was detected in 60% and 70% of hepatocytes for the 10% and 40% ESM formulations, respectively (Fig- ure 6A). For both formulations the percentage of DiD-positive cells increased significantly from 4 to 24 h (Figure 6A). Remarkably, the proportion of hepatocytes expressing GFP at both 4 and 24 hours post infection was significantly higher for LNP mRNA containing 40% ESM compared with the 10% ESM formulation (Figure 6B) or the classic Onpattro formulation containing 10 mol % DSPC (see Figures S1A and S1B). \n\nIn the case of the spleen, LNP GFP mRNA systems containing 40 mol % ESM exhibited preferential distribution to the spleen relative to LNP GFP mRNA containing 10% ESM at both 4 and 24 h post injection (Figure 7A). The proportion of splenocytes expressing GFP was similar for LNP containing both 10 and 40 mol % ESM.",

The resolution of these problems will expand the application of mRNA vaccines to a greater extent. \n\n4.1. LNP Targeting. When LNPs are injected intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), a majority of the LNPs accumulate in the liver, which contradicts the original intention of achieving the function of mRNA vaccines. Researchers are attempting to modify LNPs to alter organ targeting preferences. \u221299 Research on LNP targeting has become a global research hotspot. \u2212102 4.1.1. Modifications Made to Achieve Immune Organ Targeting. Recent studies have shown that changing the apparent acid dissociation constant (pK a ) of LNPs can enable LNPs to target extrahepatic tissues (such as the spleen or lungs). 103 The pK a of LNPs enriched in the liver is generally between 6 and 7; when the pK a is between 2 and 6, LNPs exhibit good spleen enrichment ability. 104 The surface pK a \u2248 5.7 of spleen-targeted OF-Deg-Lin FLuc mRNA LNPs also provides a good example. 105 The above phenomenon may be due to the different head groups of different ionizable cationic lipids determining the pK a , which determines the surface charge difference of LNPs, affects their ability to interact with different types of serum proteins, and ultimately leads to their different distributions in the body. The negative surface charge of LNPs is related to their uptake in the spleen. 106 Cheng et al. recently found that the presence of a fifth component, called \"selective organ targeting (SORT)\", can alter the organ targeting effect of LNPs in vivo. 107 Studies have shown that SORT lipids can affect the apparent pK a values of LNPs and the interaction between LNPs and serum proteins. Changing the quantity and type of SORT lipids can endow LNPs with different targeting selectivities. Interestingly, when the lipid 18PA, which has a negative surface charge, is added to LNPs, spleen targeting can be achieved.",

            "text": "in mice by LNP encapsulating both Cas9 nuclease mRNA and chemically modified sgRNA. Since then, researchers have shown that LNP can successfully introduce Cas9 in complex with sgRNA into crab-eating monkeys, which can achieve 73% TTR destruction in the liver and a corresponding reduction of serum TTR protein by more than 94% [288]. Next, clinical data showed that LNP introduced Cas9-sgRNA complex into patients could also reduce their serum TTR levels by up to 87% with low off-target editing. These results confirm the possibility of in vivo genome editing by LNP introduction of Cas9 and sgRNA complexes. In addition to delivering Cas9 nuclease mRNA, LNP has also been used to deliver base editor mRNA into the liver of mice and non-human primates. Xue and colleagues observed that delivery of ABE mRNA by LNP into the liver of a mouse model of tyrosinemia yielded a 12.5% base editing efficiency [289]. Schwank and colleagues observed a 10% base editing rate of phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in the liver of mice with phenylketonuria model by delivery of LNP encapsulating SaCas9-BE3 mRNA [243]. Recently, it was demonstrated by Kathiresan, Schwank et al. that the splice site of PCSK9 can be effectively interrupted by LNP delivered ABE mRNA into the liver of mice as well as crab monkeys, thus disrupting the expression of functional PCSK9 protein. Accompanied with the delivery, substantial (90%) and sustained (> 8 months) inhibition of serum PCSK9 protein and 60% reduction in blood cholesterol were achieved in crab monkeys [248]. The above studies suggest that the LNP delivered base editor has high clinical therapeutic potential for liver related genetic or metabolic diseases.\n\nSince most LNPs injected intravenously naturally accumulate in the liver, editing of other organs outside the liver is challenging. Dahlman and colleagues developed a strategy to screen hundreds of different LNPs simultaneously in vivo [290]. The strategy uses unique DNA barcodes to label different LNP formulations, allowing the LNPs to be traced by sequencing the barcodes [290]. Using this strategy, Dahlman and colleagues found an LNP",

            "text": "An Empty-MITO-Porter should be optimized to ensure dispersion stability. \n\nPreparing LNPs requires the inclusion of materials in the final product that inhibit the excessive self-assembly of lipids and provide for the formation of a stable dispersion system. PEG was found to be a particularly important factor in enhancing dispersion stability and to efficiently package for poorly water-solubility molecules such as CoQ 10 . PEG can also control pharmacokinetics including blood retention and physicochemical properties of the formulation by differences in the head structure and lipid scaffold structure 30 . To achieve purposeful LNP preparation an adequate PEG should be used and the ratios should be optimized. \n\nBiodistribution evaluations showed that CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter largely accumulated in the liver after intravenous administration. In the case of induced liver injury, the delivery of LNPs to the liver was increased significantly (Fig. 5). CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter without R8 modification significantly decreased accumulation in liver and liver mitochondria 27 . The CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter was modified with R8 on the particle surface. The data for the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ resulting CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter were in agreement with previous reports in that R8-modified nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the liver 31 . The delivery of therapeutic molecules to hepatocytes is an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of an APAP liver injury in order to reduce the levels of NAPQI, a toxic metabolite of APAP, in hepatocytes 18,19 . The capillary walls of the liver contain numerous small pores called fenestra. Therefore, the LNPs must pass through the fenestra and eventually reach hepatocytes. Since the fenestra diameter averages 141 nm and 107 nm for mice and humans, respectively 32 , the particle size needs to be controlled to less than 100 nm. The administration of 60 nm nanoparticles to mice caused a reduced APAP hepatotoxicity by allowing them to pass through the fenestra and easily access hepatocytes, as has been previously reported 33 .",

The essential properties of this LNP system are the low surface charge, size of a diameter of 100 nm or less, and high encapsulation efficacy under intravenous administration. 7 In parallel, the LNP system is ionizable and neutral under physiological pH, compared with conventional lipids, which are likely to retain positive charge regardless of different pH conditions. 7 In general, PEGylated cationic lipids and cholesterol are essential components of LNPs, in which the ionizable amino lipids are critical for constructing stable nucleic acid lipid particles. 27,28 Typically, these lipid particles are consist of ionizable lipids, including amine head parts, hydrophobic tails, and the parts linked together head-to-tails. 28 Different chemical structures of ionizable lipids performed diverse potency for nucleic acids delivery. 29 In addition, another hurdle preventing the clinical use of LNPs is the liver clearance, as the predominant targeted cell, hepatocytes are responsible for clustering LNPs via different pathways. 30 These mainly involve the robust apolipoprotein E-mediated low-density lipoprotein receptor pathway, as well as the more gradual N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc)/asialoglycoprotein receptor pathway. 30 Therefore, enhancing the bioavailability and reducing clearance ratio are crucial factors that should be taken into account for the design of LNPs to deliver RNAs. To this end, a recent work 28 demonstrated that certain numbers of ionizable amine lipids by varying formulations based on the linker moieties, gaining insight on how to build new structures of LNPs, administered beyond liver. Since the variation in the linker region could efficiently influence the efficiency of the lipids' delivery, three commonly amino molecules are used for surface modification: hydrazine, hydroxylamine, and ethanolamine. 28 The LNPs were synthesized by using a microfluidic mixing device, and the system contained a ionizable lipid, cholesterol, 1,",

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

            "text": ", outside of the liver for LNP B and the muscle at the site of the injection for LNP A, these were at a low level or modest at best. Very low levels were detected in the brain, with slightly more modest levels detected in the heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. These extrahepatic levels (excluding muscle with LNP A), as much as 3 logs lower than the liver with LNP B, are low enough that we cannot exclude or rule out that they are present from intravascular blood contamination.\n\nAs previously reported, 23 LNP A is LDL-receptor-mediated, and ARG1 mRNA uptake was effective in our previously published work in adult animals that primarily examined plasma biochemistry. 15 While not proved, we speculate that the mechanism of improved ARG1 mRNA expression mediated through LNP B likely occurs through a different mechanism than that of LNP A, which here has reduced efficacy in neonatal and young mice.\n\nThere are limitations to the study and the formulated mRNA approach. We have previously demonstrated that, in order to obtain long-term survival in arginase deficiency, $10% of wild-type hepatic arginase activity must be present. 44 In these studies, while this was accomplished with LNP B, the ability to achieve this minimum level of expression was not reached with LNP A and resulted in a much higher rate of mortality (i.e., related to hyperammonemia). With particular attention directed at LNP B, plasma arginine was nearly normalized; however, hepatic arginine, which is normally nearly undetectable, was elevated, likely due to the half-life of the mRNA and arginase protein, suggesting that only partial restoration was achieved. Lack of complete correction of intracellular arginine levels is likely the cause for some of the guanidino compounds to be incompletely corrected as hepatic arginine is their source. Furthermore, ornithine, a product of the arginase reaction, is reduced in both plasma and hepatocytes, and is further evidence of insufficient hepatic arginase activity. The presence of hypoornithinemia suggests that these treated Arg1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are in an ornithine auxotrophic state",

The nanoprecipitated cGAMP/mKRAS/LNP were purified by dialysis against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by pushing through a 0.2 \u03bcm cutoff filter. The particle size, PDI, and surface charge were assessed in a ZetaPlus (Brookhaven) instrument. Particle morphology and size were also assessed by cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM, TF20 FEI Tecnai-G2). The particle EE for cGAMP and mRNA was determined by cGAMP ELISA (Thermo) and RiboGreen assay kits (Thermo), respectively. A similar approach was used for the synthesis of carriers that incorporate cGAMP only (cGAMP/LNP), mKRAS only (mKRAS/LNP), or a combination of cGAMP with mRAS WT (cGAMP/mRAS WT /LNP).",

To avoid non-specific tissue uptake of LNP during circulation, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids were usually modified on the surface of LNP complex. The PEG lipids will gradually dissociate during blood circulation, i.e., shedding from the LNP, which mitigate its negative effects to the interaction between LNP and membrane of targeting cells 57 . In the liver targeted LNP-based drug, like Patisiran (the first siRNA-loaded LNP therapeutic being approved by FDA in 2018) 58 , the removal of PEG lipid enhanced LNP absorption on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). LNPs accumulated in the liver along the blood circulation are taken up by hepatocytes, which are mediated by ApoE receptors on the hepatocytes surface. After its endocytosis by targeting cells, the pH changes in vesicles leads to the release of nucleotides 59 . \n\nBased on this mechanism, some lncRNAs targeting siRNA delivered by LNP were also developed since the clinical success of Patisiran. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Connorty et al. 60 identified lncRNA LINC01257 as having an oncogenic role by promoting the proliferation of leukemia. By mixing siRNA with a lipid mixture (D-Lin-MC3, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG, DOPE-Rho), they targeted LINC01257 in AML cells by NxGen microfluidics systems (Fig. 6). The si-LINC01257-LNP effectively inhibits the proliferation of AML cells and reduces the off-target effects to the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

In this sense, a more rapid dissociation of PEG-lipid from the LNP surface, though decreasing the circulation time of the particle, can increase its fusogenicity, allowing the LNP to more effectively deliver its cargo to target cells. This is known as the \"PEG dilemma\": improved pharmacokinetics of the LNP system mediated by PEG, at the cost of cellular uptake and a consequently reduced transfection efficiency [ 167 ]. Increasing the PEG content additionally affects particle size, and might therefore have a detrimental effect on the amount of nucleic acid that can be encapsulated and the transfection efficiency, which is especially relevant for pDNA. Optimizing the density and the chain length of the PEG-lipid component is therefore crucial for effective development of mRNA-LNP systems. 'Diffusible' PEG-lipid was developed to balance the transfection potency and stability of LNP systems. This consists of C14 acyl chain lipids which dissociate rapidly from the LNP surface after administration into blood circulation, allowing particle uptake by cells [ 163 , 170 ]. The use of diffusible PEG-lipid in siRNA-LNPs has shown enhanced accumulation and gene silencing in hepatocytes, through facilitating apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption to the particle surface followed by rapid uptake via ApoE-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) [ 171 , 172 ].\n\nIn order to target extrahepatic tissues for vaccination purposes, incorporation of 'persistent' PEG-lipids, i.e. composed of C18 acyl chains rather than C14, can be more favorable to prevent premature clearance of LNPs. Formulations incorporating C18 PEG-lipids at molar ratios of more than 1.5% lead to increased LNP circulation time, consequently enhancing the accumulation of the LNP system at target tissues without loss of transfection potency [ 172 ]. However, a key challenge related to the longer half-life of formulations with persistent or long-chain PEG-lipid is the potential for accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon,",

            "text": "LNPs can escape from the injection site, enter the systemic circulation, and accumulate in the liver even after administration via local injection routes such as intramuscular and intratumoral injection, thus limiting the localized site-specific protein expression [13,14]. Unwanted liver accumulation of mRNA-loaded LNPs can be minimized by reticuloendothelial-systemblockade strategies such as stealth coating of liver sinusoids using two-arm-PEG-Oligo(l-Lysine). These RES-blockade strategies improved selective organ targeting of nucleic acid therapeutics by dramatically decreasing accumulation in the liver [15]. Another significant hurdle to the widespread utility of LNPs is their indispensable component: ionizable lipids. These lipids are not only highly inflammatory but also generate electrophilic impurities. These impurities can give rise to reactive moieties, including reactive oxygenated species, which can hydrolyze tertiary amines, rendering the mRNA untranslatable and leading to a loss of protein expression [16,17]. Moreover, delivering LNPs to targeted organs is often challenging due to obstacles like the blood-brain barrier and the immune system. Addressing the immune response triggered by LNPs remains a significant challenge. Stealth coatings and immunomodulators can help mitigate this issue. Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary science that uses fundamental aspects of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to design and manipulate atoms and molecules at the nanoscale to produce structures 1-1000 nm in size. Because of their small size and high surface area, the use of nanoparticles has resulted in improved drug solubility and enhanced bioavailability [18]. Over the last few decades, there have been major nanotechnological advances in the use of LNP medicine for gene and immunotherapy. In this article, we will focus on the development of LNPs through different nano-pharmaceutical techniques as well as on the strategies that may be employed to encapsulate bio-therapeutic drugs that enable gene therapies.",

            "text": "Typical LNPs are composed of four compositions and exert the characteristics of liver-targeting. Recently, Cheng et al. discovered that the presence of the fifth component, called 'Selective Organ Targeting (SORT)' molecule, could alter the organ-targeting effect of LNPs in vivo. The organ selectivity depended on the type and amount of SORT lipid added (Figure 6A-B). Notably, LNPs with four components primarily target the liver, but the luminescence activity would transfer from the liver to the spleen, and finally to the lung tissues with the increase of the fifth component-permanent cationic lipids, such as DOTAP, DDAB, and EPC. Encouragingly, the addition of negatively charged lipid, 18PA, led to spleen targeting. 14PA and 18BMP addition results demonstrated that the targeting ability was independent of the structure of negatively charged lipids used. In addition, ionizable cationic SORT lipids, such as DODAP and C12-200, enabled enhanced liver delivery without altering the tissue tropism [17,121]. Further mechanism was investigated for this organ-specific targeting. SORT lipid molecules were shown to affect the apparent pKa of LNP and the interaction between LNP and serum proteins (Figure 6C). Furthermore, targeting of LNPs to the spleen and lungs is apolipoprotein independent (Figure 6D) [121]. It is worth mentioning that this targeting strategy has been verified to deliver Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) and achieved gene editing successively in liver and lung of the mice model [122]. These findings demonstrate tremendous potential, particularly in the field of gene therapy. Thus far, the LNP-SORT platform has been established and has the potential to be used in treating primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) in the future [17]. \n\nCationic lipid has been regarded as the critical component in LNPs, and its chemical tailoring provides another option for mediating organ-targeting.",

The use of helper lipids such as cholesterol, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and PEGylated lipid PEG-C14 (molar ratio 1.5% PEG-C14 and 50% DLin-MC3-DMA) efficiently increased the stability of the formulation. PEG-C14 contains short acyl chains, which gradually dissociate from LNPs [91] during blood circulation. The removal of the PEG layer promotes the binding of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to the LNPs' surface which accumulate in the targeted liver tissues. The uptake of LNPs into hepatocytes is mediated from the interaction between ApoE on the nanoparticles surface and ApoE receptors expressed on hepatocytes cellular membrane. When inside the cells, LNPs are protonated due to the acid endosome environment. Consequently, positively charged LNPs and negatively charged endosome membrane lipids electrostatically interact resulting in the disintegration of LNPs, destabilization of the endosome membrane, and the siRNA release into the cytoplasm for therapeutic gene silencing [77,92].",

The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Cheng et al. studied the effect of SORT NPs for tissue-specific mRNA delivery, wherein different classes of LNPs were engineered systematically via the addition of a supplemental SORT molecule to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues. The four mDLNP formulations consisted of 5A2-SC8 (degradable dendritic cationic IL), cholesterol, DOPE, DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3 molar ratio), and mRNA. In this system, varying concentrations of permanent cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) were added. It was observed that the varying concentration of DOTAP was a key factor in determining tissue specificity, wherein 0% of DOTAP showed liver delivery, 10-15% showed spleen specific delivery, while 50% was optimal for lung-specific delivery. Similarly, the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) as a SORT molecule showed spleen selective delivery [81]. unmodified LNP) was ~3-folds higher in late endosomes/lysosomes, indicating improved siRNA delivery [76]. The modified LNPs resulted in the efficient delivery of siRNA-EpCAM when targeted against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) Epi-1, positive cells in vitro and also minimized the progression of tumour in mice [77]. PEGylation can also serve for the functionalization of LNP bioconjugation with biomolecules or ligands. For example, Chen et al. reported that GalNAc conjugated with LNP-siRNA-PEG formulation, a single dose of administration displayed a significant gene silencing effect on hepatocytes Factor VII (FVII).",

            "text": "By adjusting the ratio of lipids in LNPs, the targeting ability of LNPs to different organs can be tailored. Siegwart et al. [62] discovered that modifying the composition and components of LNPs allows for the selective targeting of organs. These passively targeted LNPs are termed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, facilitating controlled nucleic acid delivery to specific tissues. Lung-targeting SORT LNPs feature a notably different protein corona from liver-targeting LNPs, with a reduced enrichment of ApoE, complement components, and immunoglobulins as well as increased enrichment of vitronectin (Vtn) among other proteins [63] (Figure 4). SORT LNPs contain SORT molecules and can accurately regulate delivery to the mouse liver, lungs, and spleen after intravenous injection [64] (Table 2). Siegwart et al. [65] conducted an exploration of the targeted mechanism of SORT LNPs. They speculated that different SORT molecules may cause LNPs to absorb different plasma proteins, thereby achieving tissue-specific mRNA delivery. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona of different SORT LNPs revealed that the main proteins adsorbed by LNPs from the liver, lungs, and spleen were apolipoprotein E (apoE), vitronectin, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I, respectively. This suggests the potential to elucidate the targeting mechanism in extrahepatic tissues. Flux screening represents another method for developing tissue-specific LNPs. Dahlman et al. [66] developed a research strategy called the Joint Rapid DNA Analysis of Nanoparticles, utilizing DNA barcodes and sequencing techniques. This strategy enables the high-throughput screening of LNP formulations by encapsulating unique DNA sequences. Each LNP formulation is associated with a unique DNA barcode sequence. Using flow cytometry and nextgeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67]. \n\ngeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67].",

            "text": "The role of the PEG-lipid in stabilizing lipid nanocarriers like liposomes and LNPs is clearly demonstrated in the literature [8,26]. However, the structural conformation and the shedding nature of the PEG and their effect on the LNP biodistribution are among the less evaluated characteristics of the LNPs. Our initial comparisons of Fluc-PS80 LNPs against conventional DMG-PEG2K LNPs revealed a pronounced shift in organ distribution, with PS-80-containing formulations displaying a three-to five-fold higher accumulation in the spleen and reduced liver uptake (Figure 2). DMG-PEG2K was chosen as a standard of comparison, given that it is one of the commonly used PEG-lipids for LNP formulations. Also, DMG-PEG2K is part of the marketed drug products like Spikevax \u00ae , Onpattro \u00ae , and mRESVIA \u00ae . Nevertheless, these findings suggest that modifying the PEG-lipid structure can meaningfully alter LNP tropism, thereby improving vaccine relevant delivery to immune organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes. Notably, imaged capillary electrophoresis (iCE) measurements (see the Supplementary File, Section 2.6 and Figure S7) revealed that DMG-PEG LNPs have a slightly higher isoelectric point (pI) than PS80-based LNPs (7.96 vs. 7.63), indicating that the net charge of LNPs might have contributed to the observed LNP's biodistribution change. However, we speculate that alongside the lower net charge, PS-80's branched PEG-like headgroup can additionally alter how serum proteins adsorb to the LNP surface. This modified protein corona may favor spleen localization over hepatic clearance. In addition, PS-80 LNPs might have a reduced rate or extent of opsonization due mainly to their closer to the neutral charge relative to PEG-DMG LNPs, thereby promoting extrahepatic uptake. This hypothesis aligns with other reports indicating that subtle differences in PEGlipid structure can significantly impact biodistribution [27].",

They showed a 3.6-fold faster blood clearance and over a 20-fold higher accumulation in hepatocytes of neutral liposomes in wild-type mice compared to ApoE-deficient mice, which was not observed for negatively-charged liposomes. In a subsequent study, Akinc et al. clearly demonstrated that nearly-neutral LNPs composed of an ionizable amino lipid with an acid dissociation constant (pKa) of approximately 6.7, referred to as ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), are taken up by hepatocytes through the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous cellular uptake pathway [39]. On the other hand, cationic LNPs (cLNPs) composed of relatively cationic lipid-like materials (lipidoids) were taken up by hepatocytes and this process was not dependent on ApoE proteins. Considering the above collective information, electrostatically near-neutral LNPs that are composed of phosphatidylcholine derivatives and/or ionizable amino lipids with relatively lower pKa values have a tendency to adsorb ApoE proteins. On the other hand, it has been reported that ionizable amino lipids composed of linear saturated scaffolds or a constrained adamantane scaffold have the ability to avoid accumulation in hepatocytes, indicating that the ApoE-mediated pathway is lacking [40,41]. Further investigations will be needed to develop a precise understanding of the relationships between chemical structure requirements and ApoEmediated accumulation to hepatocytes. Akinc et al. also showed that decoration of N-acetyl-D-garactosamine (GalNAc) clusters on the surface of the siRNA-loaded iLNPs restored gene silencing in hepatocytes in ApoE-deficient mice or LDLR knockout mice. It is known that GalNAc and galactose are recognized by asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs), which are expressed in hepatocytes [42]. Due to following impressive features of ASGPRs, decorating GalNAc on nanoparticles is an alternative strategy for targeting hepatocytes [43][44]",

Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of LNP uptake in the liver, demon-strating the journey of LNPs through the sinusoidal lumen, across LSECs and the Disse space, to hepatocytes, where receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues. Depletion of Kupffer cells has been shown to improve the functional delivery of nanoparticles to hepatocytes and improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in cancer models. 36 y strategies include: \n\n(1) Saturation of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity. \n\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues.",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2.

            "text": "Nevertheless, this value remained within acceptable limits, indicating a uniform particle size distribution. Formula F7 achieved an optimal balance between particle size reduction and size distribution. Previous studies revealed that the sonication process was linked to particle reorganization dynamics that influence the particle size reduction of LNPs [49][50][51]. \n\nModification of the nanoparticle surface was carried out by the addition of DSPE-PEG\u2082\u2080\u2080\u2080-NH\u2082 and PEI (Table S3). PEGylation improves steric stability, provides a \"stealth\" effect on the body's defense system, and prevents opsonization [21,52,53]. Meanwhile, PEI contributes to increased cellular transfection efficiency through the proton sponge effect and increased surface positive charge [53][54][55]. This modification resulted in significant changes of the LNP characteristics (Figure 3A). The F9 formulation demonstrated substantial alterations in particle size and PDI values compared to F7 (p<0.05). In contrast, F8 and F7 did not exhibit significant. Despite that, these characteristics are still within the acceptable range for nanoparticle drug delivery systems targeting liver cells: particle size \u2264150 nm and PDI\u22640.400 [11][12][13][14]. Characterization of zeta potential showed a significant increase in F9 compared to F7 (p<0.05) (Figure 3B). PEI in the formula is known to have a high buffering capacity due to the presence of primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups that can be protonated, thus providing a higher positive charge density on the nanoparticle surface [56][57][58][59]. The stability of LNP depends not only on electrostatic repulsion but also on steric stabilization provided by the PEG chain. Combining electrostatic and steric stabilization can produce a good LNP system [60,61]. This F9 formulation was then referred to LNP Blank. Molecular interactions between components in LNP Blank were observed through FTIR spectroscopic analysis (Figure 3C). This interaction is related to the ability of LNP Blank to maintain the structure of nanoparticles [51,62].",

            "text": "PEG-lipids reduce aggregation of the LNPs and prolong the circulation time of the particles once administered. The molar ratio at which the lipid components are mixed is not uniform across mRNA therapeutic products and may impact the biological activity of the drug product. Roces et al. demonstrated that altering the lipid molar ratios impacts both size and zeta potential of the LNPs [200]. These characteristics of the LNP impact the biodistribution and immunogenicity of the drug product and should therefore be optimized according to the application. Studies evaluating lipid-based systems administered through subcutaneous and intramuscular injection have shown clear effects of the size on their uptake [201,202]. \n\nA study originating from Moderna demonstrated that LNP sizes between 60 and 150 nm were found to produce strong immune responses in non-human primates [201]. Thus, immunotherapeutic mRNA LNP products are likely to be produced within this range [201]. \n\nAs previously established, administration of LNPs through intravenous and intramuscular methods leads to non-specific accumulation of the particles in the liver [203]. Consequently, this accumulation may lead to side effects of the vaccine including hepatic inflammation and hepatic necrosis [204], and could limit access for patients with preexisting inflammatory conditions [205]. The ability to redirect mRNA LNP therapeutics to their target tissue is therefore critical in order to reduce off-target effects [206]. Further work to improve the distribution of LNPs to target-specific tissues is ongoing [207]. Most prominently, selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, developed by Cheng et al., demonstrated that supplementing currently established LNP compositions with specified percentages of charged molecules can alter tissue tropism [208]. Furthermore, the spleen has been shown to be effectively targeted through the use of mRNA coated lipoplexes by adjusting the charge ratio (lipid to RNA) to 1.3:2 [209]. Coating strategies for mRNA LNPs have also been explored [210], including new avenues being PEG coatings for redirection of other nanoparticles from the liver to the target tissue [211,212].",

            "text": "Our interpretation is that the compounds that required the pre-incubation step likely act on the LNP itself. The lack of efficiency when the enhancers are directly added to the cells is presumably due to the dilution in the medium. On the other hand, compounds that did not re- quire the pre-incubation are less likely to modify the LNPs and expected to act primarily on the cells. Strongly supporting this interpretation, the analysis of BADGE, which requires overnight pre-incubation, revealed that it acts upon the structure of LNPs, reducing their size. There is an optimal size range of LNPs activity (65). Increasing particle size was found to reduce silencing in hepatocytes but increase it in antigen presenting cells (34). In principle, decreasing the size of the particles could improve the uptake by gaining access to more tissues and cellular entry routes. Recent technical developments using microfluidic mixing technologies have enabled the formulation of siRNAs in LNPs as small as 25 nm (66). However, such a reduction in size occurs at the expense of a decreased payload of siRNA (67). In our experiments, the mean number of gold-siRNA per LNP was similar in DMSO and BADGE-treated LNPs (7.77 \u00b1 0.37 and 7.86 \u00b1 0.5, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S6), arguing that the reduction in size is not due to fission but rather to particle compaction. This means that BADGE reduced the size of the LNPs without sacrificing the payload of siRNA. Interestingly, Dahlman and colleagues found that new polymeric nanoparticles were able to deliver siRNAs into endothelial cells rather than hepatocytes (68). The size of these particles was between 35 and 45 nm, in the range of LNPs modified by BADGE. Based on the chemical structure of BADGE, we can envisage a possible explanation for its activity in the compaction of the particles. BADGE could insert into the LNP lipid structure mediated by hydrophobic and stacking --interactions due to the aromatic rings of BADGE and cis double bonds from the lipid (Supplementary Figure S8).",

It was observed that the identity of the CL, identity of the PL, and %PEG were statistically significant factors for the resulting LNP size, while the CL and PL were the main factors influencing PDI.",

            "text": "Non-viral delivery of the gene editing system typically implies using lipid/polymeric materials for the formulation of RNA encoding the gene editing components or, in some cases, protein complexes that directly perform gene editing in nanoparticles. A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is composed of (1) an ionizable, cationic lipid or polymeric material, which facilitates RNA entrapment in the nanoparticle; (2) a zwitterionic lipid; (3) cholesterol to stabilize the lipid layer; and (4) polyethylene glycol (PEG) to stabilize the LNP in the extracellular space [29,44]. This complex composition enables in vivo targeted delivery through several processes: stabilization of the cargo in the extracellular space; protection against immune system activation; LNP-mediated delivery to a particular cell type; and endosomal escape into the cytoplasm. Ultimately, hepatic delivery occurs through a combination of two mechanisms: passive targeting via endothelial fenestrae that are present in human liver sinusoids [45] and apolipoprotein binding to the LNP, which facilitates liver uptake [29,44]. \n\nCompared to viral delivery, LNPs elicit much weaker immune responses in vivo, which translates into their representing a safer technology and also provides potential for redosing the drug several times and increasing the efficacy of the treatment [29,30,44]. Furthermore, the expression of the gene editing component from the mRNA is transient and therefore is associated with lower immunogenicity and fewer off-target effects [44]. \n\nLNPs can be optimized for targeting different cell types in vivo; in particular, significant progress has been achieved in targeting hepatocytes [29]. Recent clinical data have shown the safety and efficacy of the gene editing therapy NTLA-2001 designed to treat hereditary amyloidosis through TTR gene knockdown in the liver [46].",

            "text": "However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR. Given this, Andrew M. Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.",

By adding entirely new components, alteration of the stoichiometry of the classical components, or both, intravenously administered LNPs can be redirected from the liver to accumulate specifically in either the lungs or spleen, likely due to alteration of the protein corona content (59). In this selective organ targeting (SORT) system, the addition of the permanently cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) changed the target organ of one LNP formulation from the liver to the lungs in a concentration-dependent fashion in mice-the higher the percentage of DOTAP in the LNP, the more specific the localization to the lungs. Similarly, the inclusion of a negatively charged component in another LNP formulation led to LNP variants that were efficiently and specifically taken up by the spleen. Encapsulation of Cas9 mRNA with sgRNA by these LNP formulations successfully edited the targeted organs with minimal editing in nontarget tissues (82). Further research into LNP formulations may enable the delivery of genome editing machinery to an even wider array of tissues. \n\nA clinical trial is currently ongoing using LNPs packaging an adenine base editor for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a primary cause of which is the decreased expression or function of LDL-R. As a result, patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) are not amenable to passive hepatocyte targeting by traditional LNPs, which rely heavily on ApoE binding to LDL-R. To circumvent this, PEG lipids were conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to generate LNPs that bind the asialoglycoprotein receptor, most highly expressed on hepatocytes. Using a custom HoFH nonhuman primate model, GalNAc-LNPs demonstrated efficient editing of the liver independent of LDL-R expression (83).",

In the last few years, many studies were focused on targeted delivery of LNPs to organs (mainly to the spleen and lungs) via changes in the charge of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the helper lipid. This strategy is called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), and the lipid responsible for the selective delivery of nanoparticles to organs is Lipids ensuring targeting of LNPs to desired organs. \n\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05 Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08 called a SORT-lipid (Cheng et al., 2020). Besides, the SORT strategy can be applied in two ways: complete replacement of a helper lipid or partial replacement (introduction of a fifth component). \n\nIn LoPresti et al. (2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).",

            "text": "Furthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

The nuclear High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein is secreted by damaged macrophages, hepatocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, and other cells following liver damage and plays a vital role in the development of inflammation in NASH. Zhou et al. constructed a Mannose-modified HMGB1-specific siRNA (mLNP-siHMGB1) in LNP in order to target liver macrophages using mannose receptor intervention. The LNP was composed of DSPC, DLinMC3-DMA, DSPE-PEG-Man, PEG-DMG, and Cholesterol. The mLNP-siHMGB1 targeted via mannose receptor silenced the HMGB1 effectively and resulted in a reduction in HMGB1 protein in the liver. The combined treatment with mLNP-siHMGB1 and docosahexaenoic acid after 8 weeks, the liver functions of NASH mice was restored to its normal levels, making the combination promising for the clinical management of NASH [174] (Figure 8). \n\nPharmaceutics 2022, 14, 2520 20 of 35 functions of NASH mice was restored to its normal levels, making the combination promising for the clinical management of NASH [174] (Figure 8). Sato et al. formulated LNPs using pH-sensitive cationic lipids YSK13-C3/chol/DMG-mPEG2k for siRNA delivery and modified them with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal-NAc), which is a hepatocyte-specific ligand. The attachment of GalNAc ligand resulted in increased specificity towards hepatocytes with a reduction in toxicity. The PEGylated GalNA-LNPs reduced the LNP-associated toxicity without affecting the gene-silencing activity of siRNA. A single injection of LNPs significantly reduced the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomic DNA and antigen in chimeric mice with humanized livers [114].",

            "text": "To achieve this goal, they developed mannose-modified LNPs that encapsulated mRNA-expressing peanut epitopes designed to enter the liver via biodistribution and be taken up by LSECs, which in turn induced a tolerance effect that effectively inhibited allergic reactions to crude peanut allergen extracts. This tolerance effect was accompanied by the inhibition of the Th2 immune response, IgE antibody production, and degranulation of mast cells. Kim et al. [93] reported the development of engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of mRNA to hepatocytes and LSECs. They evaluated the effects of the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs on the specific delivery of mRNA in the liver. Targeted mRNA delivery to the LSECs was further explored by introducing active ligands. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [94] utilized the dimensions of fenestrations in the liver and administered nanoprimers to mice as a pretreatment. This strategy aimed to reduce LNP uptake, consequently enhancing LNP accumulation in cell types other than Kupffer cells and LSECs. \n\nLiver-targeted LNPs show potential for the treatment of hereditary diseases such as hemophilia and acute intermittent porphyria [95]. Studies have identified antithrombin (AT) as a negative regulatory factor that can be targeted to treat hemophilia A and B [96,97]. Restoration of the coagulation system balance has been achieved using the RNA interference drug fitusiran to selectively inhibit AT [98]. However, it is not a long-acting medication and requires repeated injections [99]. To seek long-acting treatments for hemophilia, Han et al. [69] developed LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and mouse AT-targeted singleguide RNA (sgRNA) for AT gene editing and inhibition. They evaluated therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A and B mouse models by assessing thrombin generation mediated by mAT gene editing.",

            "text": "LNPs, composed of lipids with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, self-assemble due to unique lipid features [55,56]. LNP-RNA systems form through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in an aqueous environment. LNPs are further modified with helper lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance stability, cell entry, and circulation time [57]. Adjusting LNP components allows for tuning of their properties, with PEG content inversely affecting particle size. Studies show that particle size influences mRNA translation efficiency. PEGylation stabilizes LNPs, preventing serum protein binding and opsonization [58]. Modifying PEG acryl chain length facilitates faster shedding, reducing immune responses. Different cholesterol analogs alter LNP morphology, impacting translation efficiency and informing LNP design [58]. These modifications collectively enhance the safety, stability, and performance of LNPs for effective gene delivery [59]. \n\nCationic lipids play a crucial role in formulating LNPs with nucleic acids, interacting with negatively charged phosphate groups for LNP integration. The use of DOTMA and DOPE lipids resulted in successful transfections in 1989, establishing the effectiveness of cationic lipids in generating LNPs [60]. Despite known cytotoxicity, commercially available Lipofectamine has been widely employed for in vitro RNA and DNA transfections. Cationic and anionic lipids, when interacting, form cone-shaped structures, promoting hexagonal HII phase formation and correlating with membrane fusion, contributing to cationic lipid toxicity [60]. Systemically delivered LNPs with a permanent surface charge interact with serum proteins, leading to rapid clearance from circulation. Cationic LNPs exhibit toxicity toward phagocytic cells in vitro and induce a robust immune response, activating interferon type I and proinflammatory cytokines [56]. While excessive immune reactions are undesirable, controlled immune response activation can be advantageous in RNA-LNP-based vaccines [61].",

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile.",

Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

On the basis of the size of the hydrophilic head group relative to the size of the hydrophobic tail or tails 114 , lipids form distinct structures including micelles, liposomes and LNPs (Fig. 2a). FDAapproved LNPs contain variations of four basic components: a cationic or ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a helper lipid, and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid (Fig. 2b,c). Scientists have investigated the structure of lipid-based delivery systems complexed with nucleic acid 115,116 and demonstrated that lipid structure alters how LNPs interact with cells 117 . Given that lipid structure influences delivery and that lipids can be easily synthesized using chemistries including Michael addition-based, epoxidebased and alcohol-based reactions, scientists have created libraries of dozens to thousands of chemically distinct lipid delivery systems 118,119 . Many of these efforts focused on improving siRNA delivery to hepatocytes in mice 120 . This work, along with a more rational approach to lipid design 117 , reduced the dose required for robust in vivo hepatocyte gene silencing in mice from approximately 1.0 mg/kg (reF. 121 ) to 0.002 mg/kg (reF. 122 ). Key lipids that delivered siRNA in non-human primates included C12-200, which was synthesized using epoxideamine chemistry 120 ; cKK-E12, a peptide-like lipid compound 122 ; DLin-KC2-DMA, an ionizable lipid identified using rational design 117 ; and DLin-MC3-DMA 123 , which was used in patisiran to treat hATTR 19 (Fig. 2c,d).\n\nLNPs have also delivered mRNA to the liver in mice, in non-human primates and in humans.

            "text": "Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105 These results demonstrated that the protein corona compositions of LNPs are not only associated with surface charges but also related to the chemical structures of ionizable lipids. However, a deep understanding of how the structure of ionizable lipids affects protein corona formation remains challenging, which will greatly help design efficient targeted mRNA delivery vectors. From another perspective, the participation of targeting ligands may endow the targeting ability with delivery systems and already have been applied in vivo, 107,108 which will be detailly discussed in the following section. \n\nAnother challenge for the efficient delivery vector is to control mRNA release. 109 It should be noted that uptake is not always associated with transfection levels. Different chemical groups endow ionizable lipids with different properties, which may determine the mRNA-transfected tissue. For example, Fenton et al. 110 synthesized two structurally similar ionizable lipids OF-02 109 and OF-Deg-Lin, 108 with a slight difference in their hydrophobic tails. OF-02 with nondegradable tails and OF-Deg-Lin containing degradable ester linkages were formulated into LNPs and showed good mRNA transfection efficiency in vivo. Interestingly, following systemic administration, OF-02 and OF-Deg-Lin LNPs mostly accumulated in the livers. However, degradable OF-Deg-Lin LNPs induced protein expression predominantly in the spleen, and nondegradable OF-02 LNPs induced protein expression predominantly in the liver. This phenomenon could be attributed to the degradable property of OF-Deg-Lin. The degradable ester linkages are stable at physiological pH (\u223c7.4) but enzymatically hydrolyzed within tissues and cells. It is worth to be noticed that compared with the liver, the spleen contains a relatively low abundance of hydrolases. 111 Thus, the LNPs are still transported to the liver but may be easily degraded before actively inducing protein expression.",

            "text": "Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Despite constituting the smallest molar percentage of lipids in LNPs, typically around 1.5 mol%, PEG-lipids exert a substantial impact on the critical properties of LNPs. Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells that reside within the liver sinusoids are the largest cell population of the MPS and have important roles in immune surveillance and clearance [132]. Intravenously injected NPs are usually trapped in the liver owing to the special structure of hepatic sinusoids, resulting in high endocytosis by hepatocytes, hepatic endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells [62,133]. For example, LNPs were first opsonized by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the blood circulation after intravenous injection and entered the hepatocytes by binding to the ApoE receptor on the surfaces of hepatocytes [134,135]. Holmes et al. demonstrated that intravenous injection of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs delivered mRNA of zincfinger nuclease (ZFN) that induced the highest gene knockout efficiency in hepatocytes (approximately 80%), whereas the gene knockout  [96].

(C) The structure of C1-lipid and self-assembly of C1-mRNA nanovaccine for OVA mRNA delivery [114]. efficiency in Kupffer cells and endothelial cells was approximately 60% [136]. Thus, achieving high transfection efficiency in Kupffer cells while reducing the transfection efficiency to other liver cells remains a challenge.\n\nThe structure of lipids has significant impacts on the delivery efficiency of LNPs in vivo. For example, the structure of cholesterol, which is an important component for stabilizing the LNPs, may affect the efficiency of LNPs for delivering mRNA to Kupffer cells in vivo [137]. Paunovska et al. established a library of cholesterol variants and evaluated the efficiency of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Their results demonstrated that the LNPs formulated using C18-PEG 2K , DOPE, cKK-E12 ionizable lipid, and 20\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol (20\u03b1-OH)-modified cho",

We employed the typical excipients in LNP products, including DLin-MC3-DMA, DPSC, and cholesterol.

The fast de-PEGylation resulted in short blood circulation and high accumulation in the liver. However, the ultrafast de-PEGylation enabled the deposition of more LNPs in Kupffer cells other than hepatocytes. Surprisingly, simply changing the terminal groups of PEGylated lipids from methoxyl to carboxyl or amine could dramatically increase the liver delivery of LNPs, which might be associated with the accelerated de-PEGylation rate and enhanced LNP-cell interaction.

For in vivo distribution studies, pegylated and nonpegylated nanoparticles were prepared with polymer mixtures containing PBLG-fluorescein isothiocyanate and imaged by fluorescence microscopy to measure their accumulation in liver and spleen tissues of rats after intravenous administration. Injection of stealth formulations resulted in negligible fluorescence in liver and spleen compared with nonpegylated formulations, which suggests that these nanoparticles are promising candidates as a stealth-type long-circulating drug carrier system and could be useful for active targeting of drugs while reducing systemic side effects.",

Here, we developed a therapeutic cancer vaccine for multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer of the plasma cells. We targeted B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) protein, as it's considered a therapeutic target for MM because of its high and selective expression on the MM cell surface.\n We first packaged the BCMA mRNA into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which is an FDA-approved delivery mechanism that can efficiently deliver the mRNA to antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). We also encapsulated a potential Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) in LNPs to further elicit the immune response. We found that the resulting particles were in the range of ~100 nm in size and had >96% loading for both BCMA and Poly: IC LNPs. The switch in surface charge from negative at physiological pH (7.4) to positive in the acidic endosomal environment confirmed the efficient endosomal escape of the mRNA into the cytosol. In addition, LNPs were stable during incubation in human serum for 2h at 37\u00b0C, unlike free mRNA. Finally, we confirmed that LNPs loaded with mRNA encoding GFP succeeded in expressing GFP within the cytosol of DCs, as compared to free mRNA.\n To assess our vaccine in vitro, we isolated monocyte-derived dendritic cells and naive T cells from the same healthy human donor, and after treatment, the DCs were co-cultured with T cells for 5 days. We measured carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution percentage to evaluate T cell proliferation and found 71.9\u00b14.0% and 51.7\u00b14.3% of CFSE dilution for BCMA+ Poly: IC LNPs and BCMA LNPs, respectively, as compared to free mRNA (9.7\u00b14.0%, p<0.05). We found that the CTLs from this co-culture effectively lysed U266 cells but not BCMA-KO cells (p<0.05). An ELISpot assay found an enhanced (p<0.05) spot count (SFC per million cells) for IFN\u0263 and TNF\u03b1 for packaged BCMA mRNA and for the combination treatment with poly: IC in comparison to free BCMA mRNA.\n To assess the biodistribution, we loaded the LNPs with DiR dye and further to evaluate in vivo translational potential, mRNA encoding firefly luciferase (fLuc) was packaged and treated C57BL/6 mice.

Using RNAi, it is possible to knock down expression of viral RNAs including the pregenomic RNA from which the replicative intermediates are derived, thus reducing viral load, and the viral proteins that result in disease and impact the immune system's ability to eliminate the virus. We previously described the use of polymer-based Dynamic PolyConjugate (DPC) for the targeted delivery of siRNAs to hepatocytes. Here, we first show in proof-of-concept studies that simple coinjection of a hepatocyte-targeted, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated melittin-like peptide (NAG-MLP) with a liver-tropic cholesterol-conjugated siRNA (chol-siRNA) targeting coagulation factor VII (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines. Using transient and transgenic mouse models of HBV infection, we show that a single coinjection of NAG-MLP with potent chol-siRNAs targeting conserved HBV sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral RNA, proteins, and viral DNA with long duration of effect. These results suggest that coinjection of NAG-MLP and chol-siHBVs holds great promise as a new therapeutic for patients chronically infected with HBV."

Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity (Sato et al., 2016)...A recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes (Chen et al., 2016). A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations)...LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting...A key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 (Cullis et al., 2017)(Jayaraman et al., 2012). Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs (Sato et al., 2016)(Shobaki et al., 2018).

Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.",

Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems.",

Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues.

We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \u201cconstrained phospholipids\u201d delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery.

The main factor known to determine their delivery efficiency is the pKa of the LNP containing an ionizable lipid. Herein, we report a method that can predict the LNP pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid. We used theoretical, NMR, fluorescent-dye binding, and electrophoretic mobility methods to comprehensively measure protonation of both the ionizable lipid and the formulated LNP. The pKa of the ionizable lipid was 2-3 units higher than the pKa of the LNP primarily due to proton solvation energy differences between the LNP and aqueous medium. We exploited these results to explain a wide range of delivery efficiencies in vitro and in vivo for intramuscular (IM) and intravascular (IV) administration of different ionizable lipids at escalating ionizable lipid-to-mRNA ratios in the LNP. In addition, we determined that more negatively charged LNPs exhibit higher off-target systemic expression of mRNA in the liver following IM administration. This undesirable systemic off-target expression of mRNA-LNP vaccines could be minimized through appropriate design of the ionizable lipid and LNP. Carrasco et al. report a method that can predict the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid.

Biodistributions of injected LNPs in mice were measured by fluorescence bioimaging or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, luciferase expression levels were determined by bioluminescence imaging and enzyme activity assays. Some intramuscularly injected LNPs were found circulating in the system, resulting in accumulation in the liver and spleen, especially when the LNP sizes were relatively small. Bigger LNPs were more likely to remain at the injection site. Transgene expression in the liver was found most prominent compared with other organs and tissues. Biomolecules such as mRNAs encapsulated in locally injected LNPs can reach other organs and tissues via systemic circulation. Gene expression levels are affected by the LNP biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK), which are further influenced by the particle size and injection route.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes.

LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent formulations as determined by their ability to inhibit the production of GAPDH target protein. Also, LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent intracellular delivery agents as indicated by confocal studies of endosomal versus cytoplamic siRNA location using fluorescently labeled siRNA. DLinK-DMA and DLinKC2-DMA formulations exhibited improved gene silencing potencies relative to DLinDMA but were less toxic. In vivo results showed that LNP siRNA systems containing DLinKC2-DMA are effective agents for silencing GAPDH in APCs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity following systemic administration. Gene silencing in APCs was RNAi mediated and the use of larger LNPs resulted in substantially reduced hepatocyte silencing, while similar efficacy was maintained in APCs.

Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105](Das et al., 2014).",

Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105](Das et al., 2014)."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver.",

Herein, structure-activity analysis of cholesterol analogues reveals that incorporation of C-24 alkyl phytosterols into LNPs (eLNPs) enhances gene transfection and the length of alkyl tail, flexibility of sterol ring and polarity due to -OH group is required to maintain high transfection. Cryo-TEM displays a polyhedral shape for eLNPs compared to spherical LNPs, while x-ray scattering shows little disparity in internal structure. eLNPs exhibit higher cellular uptake and retention, potentially leading to a steady release from the endosomes over time. 3D single-particle tracking shows enhanced intracellular diffusivity of eLNPs relative to LNPs, suggesting eLNP traffic to productive pathways for escape. Our findings show the importance of cholesterol in subcellular transport of LNPs carrying mRNA and emphasize the need for greater insights into surface composition and structural properties of nanoparticles, and their subcellular interactions which enable designs to improve endosomal escape. Endosomal sequestration of lipid-based nanoparticles is a barrier to delivery of nucleic acids.

However, the therapeutic potential of siRNAs remains severely limited by a lack of effective delivery vehicles. Recently, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing ionizable cationic lipids have been developed for hepatic siRNA delivery. However, their suitability for delivery to other cell types has not been determined. We have modified LNPs for preferential targeting to dendritic cells (DCs), central regulators of immune responses. To achieve directed delivery, we coated LNPs with a single-chain antibody (scFv; DEC-LNPs), specific to murine DEC205, which is highly expressed on distinct DC subsets. Here we show that injection of siRNAs encapsulated in DEC-LNPs are preferentially delivered to DEC205+ DCs. Gene knockdown following uptake of DEC-LNPs containing siRNAs specific for the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 dramatically decreases gene expression levels. We demonstrate the functionality of this knockdown with a mixed lymphocyte response (MLR). Overall, we report that injection of LNPs modified to restrict their uptake to a distinct cell population can confer profound gene knockdown, sufficient to inhibit powerful immune responses like the MLR.",

This makes BMECs an important target cell type for siRNA or gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) therapies. However, siRNA and sgRNA have not been delivered to BMECs using systemically administered nanoparticles. Given that in vitro nanoparticle screens have not identified nanoparticles with BMEC tropism, we developed a system to quantify how >100 different nanoparticles deliver siRNA in a single mouse. This is the first barcoding system capable of quantifying functional cytosolic siRNA delivery (where the siRNA drug is active), distinguishing it from in vivo screens that quantify biodistribution (where the siRNA drug went). Combining this approach with bioinformatics, we performed in vivo directed evolution, and identified BM1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that delivers siRNA and sgRNA to BMECs. Interestingly, chemical analysis revealed BMEC tropism was not related to LNP size; tropism changed with the structure of poly(ethylene glycol), as well as the presence of cholesterol. These results suggest that significant changes to vascular targeting can be imparted to a LNP by making simple changes to its chemical composition, rather than using active targeting ligands. BM1 is the first nanoparticle to efficiently deliver siRNA and sgRNA to BMECs in vivo, demonstrating that this functional in vivo screen can identify nanoparticles with novel tropism in vivo. More generally, in vivo screening may help reveal the complex relationship between nanoparticle structure and tropism, thereby helping scientists understand how simple chemical changes control nanoparticle targeting."

(Chen et al., 2016) Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection.

Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity.

Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona.

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed to protect nucleic acids from degradation and mediate their intracellular delivery, it is challenging to predict how alterations in LNP formulation parameters influence delivery to different organs. In this study, we utilized high-throughput in vivo screening to probe for structure-function relationships of intravenously administered LNPs along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to measure the binding affinity of LNPs to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein implicated in the clearance and uptake of lipoproteins by the liver. High-throughput in vivo screening of a library consisting of 96 LNPs identified several formulations containing the helper lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) that preferentially accumulated in the liver, while identical LNPs that substituted DOPE with the helper lipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) preferentially accumulated in the spleen. Using QCM-D, it was found that one DOPE-containing LNP formulation (LNP 42) had stronger interactions with ApoE than an identical LNP formulation that substituted DOPE with DSPC (LNP 90). In order to further validate our findings, we formulated LNP 42 and LNP 90 to encapsulate Cy3-siRNA or mRNA encoding for firefly luciferase. The DSPC-containing LNP (LNP 90) was found to increase delivery to the spleen for both siRNA (two-fold) and mRNA (five-fold). In terms of liver delivery, the DOPE-containing LNP (LNP 42) enhanced mRNA delivery to the liver by two-fold and improved liver transfection by three-fold. Understanding the role of the helper lipid in LNP biodistribution and ApoE adsorption may aid in the future design of LNPs for nucleic acid therapeutics.",

The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. (Chen et al., 2016) Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. (Mui et al., 2013) elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. (Zhang et al., 2021) NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). (Akinc et al., 2010)(Sabnis et al., 2018)(Chen et al., 2019) In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models.

SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al., 2021)...The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al., 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes...It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al., 2017).",

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice.

They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney.",

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",

Due to the inherent instability and negative-charges of RNA molecules, RNA-based therapeutics can make the most use of delivery systems to overcome biological barriers and to release the RNA payload into the cytosol. Among different types of delivery systems, lipid-based RNA delivery systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have been extensively studied due to their unique properties, such as simple chemical synthesis of lipid components, scalable manufacturing processes of LNPs, and wide packaging capability. LNPs represent the most widely used delivery systems for RNA-based therapeutics, as evidenced by the clinical approvals of three LNP-RNA formulations, patisiran, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273. This review covers recent advances of lipids, lipid derivatives, and lipid-derived macromolecules used in RNA delivery over the past several decades. We focus mainly on their chemical structures, synthetic routes, characterization, formulation methods, and structure-activity relationships. We also briefly describe the current status of representative preclinical studies and clinical trials and highlight future opportunities and challenges."

This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. (Sago et al., 2019)(Khalil et al., 2020) Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. (Kong et al., 2024) This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects...Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm)...Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs.

However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. (Tavares et al., 2017) For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising carriers for producing clinically approved products in the future. Compared with other systems used for nonviral gene delivery, LNPs provide several advantages including higher stability, low toxicity, and greater efficiency. Additionally, systems based on LNPs can be modified with ligands and devices for controlled biodistribution and internalization into specific cells. Efforts are ongoing to improve the efficiency of lipid-based gene vectors. These efforts depend on the appropriate design of nanocarriers as well as the development of new lipids with improved gene delivery ability. Several ionizable lipids have recently been developed and have shown dramatically improved efficiency. However, enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to target specific cells in the body remains the most difficult challenge. Systemically administered LNPs can access organs in which the capillaries are characterized by the presence of fenestrations, such as the liver and spleen. The liver has received the most attention to date, although targeted delivery to the spleen has recently emerged as a promising tool for modulating the immune system. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids. We focus mainly on targeting liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells as excellent targets for gene therapy.

Their physiochemical attributes, encompassing size, charge and surface modifications, significantly affect their behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of these properties on the transfection and distribution of LNPs after intramuscular injection remain elusive. In this study, LNPs with varying sizes, lipid-based charges and PEGylated lipids were formulated to study their transfection and in vivo distribution. Luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was entraped in LNPs as a model nucleic acid molecule. Results indicated that smaller-sized LNPs and those with neutral potential presented superior transfection efficiency after intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the sizes and charges did not exert a notable influence on the in vivo distribution of the LNPs. Furthermore, PEGylated lipids with shorter acyl chains contributed to enhanced transfection efficiency due to their superior cellular uptake and lysosomal escape capabilities. Notably, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake differed among LNPs containing various types of PEGylated lipids, which was primarily attributed to the length of their acyl chain. Together, these insights underscore the pivotal role of nanoparticle characteristics and PEGylated lipids in the intramuscular route. This study not only fills crucial knowledge gaps but also provides significant directions for the effective delivery of mRNA via LNPs.

Here, we reformulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) through adjustments in lipid material structures and compositions to systematically achieve the pulmonary and hepatic (respectively) targeted mRNA distribution and expression. A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases."

Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems."

The liver represents a primary target for LNP-based therapies due to its natural role in filtering blood and metabolizing foreign substances. When administered intravenously, LNPs exhibit inherent hepatic tropism, with approximately 60-80% of the injected dose accumulating in the liver. This natural targeting occurs primarily because the liver's unique vascular structure features fenestrated endothelium with pores (100-150 nm in diameter) that allow LNPs to extravasate from bloodstream into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes. Additionally, the liver's resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) actively capture circulating nanoparticles, contributing to hepatic accumulation. While this natural tropism is advantageous for liver-directed therapies, optimizing LNP formulations specifically for hepatocyte targeting remains crucial, as non-specific uptake by Kupffer cells and other non-parenchymal cells can reduce therapeutic efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity (Sato et al., 2016)",

A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations)",

Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs (Sato et al., 2016)(Shobaki et al., 2018). Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159]."

                            "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. (Sago et al., 2019)(Khalil et al., 2020) Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. (Kong et al., 2024) This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects",
                            "Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm)",
                            "Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. (Kim et al., 2021) pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. (Chen et al., 2024) Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",
                            "Kupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. (Tavares et al., 2017) For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. (Kim et al., 2021)"

In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream (Patel et al., 2020)",

Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment (Sato et al., 2016). In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm (Chen et al., 2016). Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology."

                            "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake (Di et al., 2022)",
                            "Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells (Akinc et al., 2010). These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above",
                            "The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake (Carrasco et al., 2021). Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake (Cheng et al., 2020). The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019). The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells (Gan et al., 2020). Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm (Desjardins et al., 2003); LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection (Basha et al., 2011)."

For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Notably, liver accumulation is known to correlate positively with particle size. This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%).

LNPs containing ionizable lipids with an optimal apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 demonstrate superior hepatocyte-specific gene silencing efficiency, as discovered during the development of Onpattro\u00ae <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"40205755\" paperTitle=\"(Jayaraman et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This narrow pKa range allows LNPs to maintain a near-neutral charge in circulation (pH ~7.4) while becoming positively charged in the acidic endosomal environment, facilitating endosomal escape and cytosolic delivery.\n\nIntriguingly, modifying the pKa value provides precise control over the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs. Increasing the pKa value to approximately 7.15 shifts LNP targeting from hepatocytes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The incorporation of neutral lipids in LNPs maintains their natural liver tropism following intravenous injection, while adding cationic lipids shifts biodistribution toward the lungs, and incorporating negatively charged lipids redirects LNPs to the spleen <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Neutrally charged LNPs bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which facilitates hepatocyte uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) <Paper corpusId=\"259236911\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Different surface charges attract distinct serum proteins, creating unique protein coronas that influence biodistribution <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, introducing positive charge through cationic lipids shifts the protein corona from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, affecting targeting efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe route of administration also affects how surface charge influences LNP distribution. For intramuscularly administered LNPs, negatively charged particles demonstrate greater liver uptake <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236989455\" paperTitle=\"(Carrasco et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that controlling surface charge is critical for minimizing off-target systemic expression following local administration of mRNA-LNP vaccines <Paper corpusId=\"236989455\" paperTitle=\"(Carrasco et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, specialized lipid modifications can further refine hepatic cell targeting.

Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity (Sato et al., 2016)",

A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations)",

                            "While a variety of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery compounds have been developed, a deep understanding of the key parameters that determine the quality of siRNA delivery are not known with certainty. Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems."

This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges.

                            "Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells (Akinc et al., 2010). These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above",
                            "The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake (Carrasco et al., 2021). Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake (Cheng et al., 2020). The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019). The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells (Gan et al., 2020). Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm (Desjardins et al., 2003); LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection (Basha et al., 2011)."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution (Sago et al., 2018)(Katakowski et al., 2015). In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream (Patel et al., 2020)",
                            "Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high (Huang et al., 2022)",
                            "The method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment (Sato et al., 2016). In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm (Chen et al., 2016). Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor. The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance."

                            "Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) are used to deliver siRNA and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The main factor known to determine their delivery efficiency is the pKa of the LNP containing an ionizable lipid. Herein, we report a method that can predict the LNP pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid. We used theoretical, NMR, fluorescent-dye binding, and electrophoretic mobility methods to comprehensively measure protonation of both the ionizable lipid and the formulated LNP. The pKa of the ionizable lipid was 2-3 units higher than the pKa of the LNP primarily due to proton solvation energy differences between the LNP and aqueous medium. We exploited these results to explain a wide range of delivery efficiencies in vitro and in vivo for intramuscular (IM) and intravascular (IV) administration of different ionizable lipids at escalating ionizable lipid-to-mRNA ratios in the LNP. In addition, we determined that more negatively charged LNPs exhibit higher off-target systemic expression of mRNA in the liver following IM administration. This undesirable systemic off-target expression of mRNA-LNP vaccines could be minimized through appropriate design of the ionizable lipid and LNP. Carrasco et al. report a method that can predict the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid. They investigate the delivery efficiency for intramuscular and intravascular administration and propose design principles to limit off-target systemic distribution and expression for mRNA LNP vaccines."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "Abstract Once inside the cytoplasm of a cell, mRNA can be used to treat disease by upregulating the expression of any gene. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in humans, yet systemic non\u2010hepatocyte delivery at clinical doses remains difficult. We noted that LNPs have historically been formulated with phospholipids containing unconstrained alkyl tails. Based on evidence that constrained adamantyl groups have unique properties that can improve small molecule drug delivery, we hypothesized that a phospholipid containing an adamantyl group would facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo. We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \"constrained phospholipids\" delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg. Unlike many previous LNPs, these (a) did not preferentially target hepatocytes and (b) delivered mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands. These data suggest constrained phospholipids may be useful LNP components."

Despite some progress, delivery systems are still unable to fully achieve this. Here, we reformulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) through adjustments in lipid material structures and compositions to systematically achieve the pulmonary and hepatic (respectively) targeted mRNA distribution and expression. A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases."

                "text": "\nThe polyethylene glycol (PEG) component of LNPs plays a crucial dual role in hepatic targeting\u2014providing stability during circulation while allowing for eventual cellular uptake through a controlled shedding process. The concentration and chain length of PEG-lipids significantly influence LNP liver accumulation and hepatocyte targeting efficiency. Studies have shown that LNPs containing approximately 1.5% PEG-lipids demonstrate superior hepatocyte targeting compared to formulations with higher PEG content (2.5-5%), despite having shorter blood circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"262060986\" paperTitle=\"(Bakrania et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This optimal PEG concentration represents a threshold at which chain length has minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing while still allowing for favorable pharmacokinetics <Paper corpusId=\"262060986\" paperTitle=\"(Bakrania et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258617465\" paperTitle=\"(Hibino et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe carbon chain length of PEG-lipids critically affects their rate of dissociation from LNPs, which directly impacts hepatocyte targeting. LNPs formulated with shorter PEG-lipid chains (C14) exhibit approximately 2.3-fold higher liver delivery efficiency compared to those with longer chains (C18) within 24 hours of intravenous administration <Paper corpusId=\"262060986\" paperTitle=\"(Bakrania et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258617465\" paperTitle=\"(Hibino et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced delivery occurs because shorter PEG chains detach more rapidly from LNPs in circulation, exposing the LNP surface for interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which mediates hepatocyte uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe mechanism behind PEG-mediated hepatic targeting follows a two-step process: first, PEG lipids shed from the LNP surface, and second, ApoE adsorbs onto the exposed LNP surface, facilitating hepatocyte internalization and endosomal escape <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This shedding process is crucial, as excessive PEGylation can inhibit cellular transfection by preventing necessary interactions with cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"257960145\" paperTitle=\"(Anwar et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The balance between stability in circulation and eventual cellular uptake can be further optimized through the development of sheddable PEG variants, such as pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG-lipids <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo enhance hepatocyte specificity, PEG components can be functionalized with targeting ligands. The most successful approach involves N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) modification, which targets the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) abundantly expressed on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. GalNAc-modified LNPs offer an \"exogenous\" targeting mechanism that operates independently of ApoE, providing an alternative pathway for hepatocyte entry <Paper corpusId=\"221520813\" paperTitle=\"(Yamada et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach is particularly valuable for patients lacking functional LDLR, as it bypasses the conventional ApoE-LDLR pathway <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nA notable advantage of GalNAc-modified LNPs is their enhanced hepatocyte specificity. Studies have shown that decorating LNPs with GalNAc reduces their accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), minimizing off-target effects and associated toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"221520813\" paperTitle=\"(Yamada et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, GalNAc/PEG-shielded LNPs display approximately 18-fold longer blood circulation times compared to unmodified LNPs that rely on endogenous targeting mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"221520813\" paperTitle=\"(Yamada et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile PEGylation enhances LNP stability and circulation time, it can present challenges with repeated administration. The production of anti-PEG antibodies following multiple doses can reduce therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This has prompted research into PEG alternatives and modified coating strategies for prolonged circulation and enhanced targeting <Paper corpusId=\"263840863\" paperTitle=\"(Youssef et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond hepatocyte targeting, PEG content can be manipulated to direct LNPs to other cell types within the liver. Highly PEGylated LNPs with active targeting ligands can block ApoE-mediated uptake, enabling selective delivery to specific liver cell populations <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, mannose-PEG modification enhances receptor-specific delivery to LSECs while minimizing uptake by hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "This is largely impacted by the amount and length of PEG-lipids in LNPs. For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. (Chen et al., 2016) Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. (Mui et al., 2013) elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. (Zhang et al., 2021) NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). (Akinc et al., 2010)(Sabnis et al., 2018)(Chen et al., 2019) In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models.

                            "Biodistribution evaluations showed that CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter largely accumulated in the liver after intravenous administration. In the case of induced liver injury, the delivery of LNPs to the liver was increased significantly (Fig. 5). CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter without R8 modification significantly decreased accumulation in liver and liver mitochondria 27 . The CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter was modified with R8 on the particle surface. The data for the resulting CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter were in agreement with previous reports in that R8-modified nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the liver 31 . The delivery of therapeutic molecules to hepatocytes is an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of an APAP liver injury in order to reduce the levels of NAPQI, a toxic metabolite of APAP, in hepatocytes 18,19 . The capillary walls of the liver contain numerous small pores called fenestra. Therefore, the LNPs must pass through the fenestra and eventually reach hepatocytes. Since the fenestra diameter averages 141 nm and 107 nm for mice and humans, respectively 32 , the particle size needs to be controlled to less than 100 nm. The administration of 60 nm nanoparticles to mice caused a reduced APAP hepatotoxicity by allowing them to pass through the fenestra and easily access hepatocytes, as has been previously reported 33",

Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes (Zhang et al., 2021)."

Hepatic accumulation is, therefore, considered the most significant barrier in advancing mRNA-LNP therapeutics to extrahepatic targets. The main reason for LNP build up in the liver is the presence of large vasculature in liver sinusoids and relatively slower blood flow, which results in extravasation of LNPs in the liver. Hepatic targeting is a two-step process that starts with PEG shedding followed by internalization by hepatocytes and subsequent endosomal escape."

Adding PEG lipids to LNPs increases circulation half-life, essential for effective in vivo delivery (Chen et al., 2016). However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference (Chen et al., 2016). LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors (Chen et al., 2016)(Shi et al., 2011). This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein (Chen et al., 2016)(Akinc et al., 2010)."

This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. (Sago et al., 2019)(Khalil et al., 2020) Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. (Kong et al., 2024) This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects",
                            "Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm)",

PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. (Kim et al., 2021) pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. (Chen et al., 2024) Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. (Tavares et al., 2017) For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. (Kim et al., 2021)"

To expand the scope of LNPs to non-hepatic cells, Cheng et al. developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and achieved spleen-and lungselective mRNA delivery by incorporating anionic phospholipids and permanently cationic lipids into conventional four-component LNPs, respectively (Cheng et al., 2020). SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al., 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes",

Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR. Given this, Andrew M. Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model."

Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105](Das et al., 2014)."

                            "Following systemic administration, LNPs undergo desorption of PEG-lipids and adsorption of soluble ApoE on their surface, which facilitates hepatic entry by the improved binding to LDLR that is heavily expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes (Akinc et al., 2010). To expand the scope of LNPs to non-hepatic cells, Cheng et al. developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and achieved spleen-and lungselective mRNA delivery by incorporating anionic phospholipids and permanently cationic lipids into conventional four-component LNPs, respectively (Cheng et al., 2020). SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "The first exogenous targeting strategy for the liver was explored for siRNA delivery using a trivalent GalNAc-PEG-lipid that targets the ASGPR (Akinc et al., 2010). It was found that GalNAc modification was able to rescue the potency of LNPs in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice in a GalNAc-dependent manner. Furthermore, GalNAc-LNPs exhibited comparable activity in wild-type and LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the GalNAc-PEG-lipid can serve as an alternative and effective ligand to allow efficient internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes",
                            "It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al., 2017)."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "It has also been reported that decorating GalNAc on siRNA-loaded LNPs contributed to improving hepatocyte-specificity and reduced cationic lipid-associated hepatic toxicity which is caused by the off-target accumulation of the LNPs to LSECs and activation of the same cell type followed by neutrophil-mediated inflammation [46].\n\nWe recently investigated this using siRNA-loaded LNPs, the surfaces of which were modified differently so as to modify the mechanism for hepatocyte targeting ( Fig. 1) [47]. The blood half-life of unmodified (bare) LNPs that target hepatocytes through the endogenous mechanism was only 1.8 min, which was much (approx. 18-fold) faster than that of GalNAc/Shielded LNPs (modified with both GalNac and PEG) that target hepatocytes though the exogenous mechanism."

                            "In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR. Given this, Andrew M. Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model."

                            "RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics have the potential to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a fundamentally different manner than current therapies. Using RNAi, it is possible to knock down expression of viral RNAs including the pregenomic RNA from which the replicative intermediates are derived, thus reducing viral load, and the viral proteins that result in disease and impact the immune system's ability to eliminate the virus. We previously described the use of polymer-based Dynamic PolyConjugate (DPC) for the targeted delivery of siRNAs to hepatocytes. Here, we first show in proof-of-concept studies that simple coinjection of a hepatocyte-targeted, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated melittin-like peptide (NAG-MLP) with a liver-tropic cholesterol-conjugated siRNA (chol-siRNA) targeting coagulation factor VII (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines. Using transient and transgenic mouse models of HBV infection, we show that a single coinjection of NAG-MLP with potent chol-siRNAs targeting conserved HBV sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral RNA, proteins, and viral DNA with long duration of effect. These results suggest that coinjection of NAG-MLP and chol-siHBVs holds great promise as a new therapeutic for patients chronically infected with HBV."

                            "For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (Braet et al., 2002). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (Wisse et al., 2008). Chen and coworkers (Chen et al., 2016) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation",

However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver (Urits et al., 2020)(Sebastiani et al., 2021). Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes (Zhang et al., 2021)."

This strategy improves therapeutic nucleic acid delivery to hepatocytes by reducing LNP uptake by the RES, enhancing bioavailability of the therapeutic cargo and increasing efficacy by up to 49% for siRNA silencing. <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Kupffer cell depletion**: Selectively depleting Kupffer cells can minimize LNP clearance and improve hepatocyte targeting.

LNPs that adsorb significant amounts of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) facilitate hepatocyte endocytosis via low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), while those that predominantly adsorb albumin are more readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Manipulating LNP composition to control protein corona formation can enhance hepatocyte targeting. <Paper corpusId=\"274332884\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235214156\" paperTitle=\"(Vlatkovic, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **Oxidized cholesterol modifications**: Screening LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterols has revealed that these modifications can significantly alter LNP targeting preferences. While conventional LNPs primarily target hepatocytes, those containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to other liver microenvironment cells, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. The position of the oxidative modification appears important, with cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D outperforming those modified on sterol ring B. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n5. **Cholesterol removal**: Contrary to conventional LNP design principles, recent studies demonstrate that removing cholesterol from LNP formulations can reduce liver accumulation and increase delivery to other organs like the spleen.

Additionally, mannose-PEG modifications enhance receptor-specific delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) while minimizing uptake by hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n9. **Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids**: These specialized lipid components improve endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery, enhancing the functional delivery of therapeutic cargo. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n10. **Size optimization for different species**: Recent work has shown that optimal LNP size can vary between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) demonstrated approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in the liver compared to conventional larger particles (70-80 nm), highlighting the importance of species-specific optimization. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "Despite tremendous interest in gene therapies, the systemic delivery of nucleic acids still faces substantial challenges. To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

                            "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. (Sago et al., 2019)(Khalil et al., 2020) Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. (Kong et al., 2024) This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects",
                            "Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm)",
                            "Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. (Kim et al., 2021) pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. (Chen et al., 2024) Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",
                            "Kupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. (Tavares et al., 2017) For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. (Kim et al., 2021)"

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake. [86]87] e PEG shield significantly impacts LNP uptake rates in cells and can cause substantial disparities between in vitro and in vivo results."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

(Paunovska et al., 2019) explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications."

Despite some progress, delivery systems are still unable to fully achieve this. Here, we reformulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) through adjustments in lipid material structures and compositions to systematically achieve the pulmonary and hepatic (respectively) targeted mRNA distribution and expression. A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."
