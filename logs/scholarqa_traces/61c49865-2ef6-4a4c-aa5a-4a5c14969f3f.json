Within we review the literature regarding proposed modes of action for metal and metal-oxide NPs, two of the most prevalent types manufactured. Iron-oxide NPs, for instance, are used as tracers for magnetic resonance imaging of oncological tumors and as vehicles for therapeutic drug delivery. Factors and theories that determine the physicochemical and biokinetic behaviors of NPs are discussed, along with the observed toxicological effects of NPs on cells. Key thermodynamic and kinetic models that explain the sources of energy transfer from NPs to biological targets are summarized, in addition to quantitative structural activity relationship (QSAR) modeling efforts. Future challenges for nanotoxicological research are discussed. We conclude that NP studies based on cell culture are often inconsistent and underestimate the toxicity of NPs. Thus, the effect of NPs needs to be examined in whole animal systems.\n## Protein Coronas form on NPs in vivo and Have Both Beneficial and Adverse Effects\nHowever, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells.

However, the failure of many polymer-drug conjugates in clinical trials suggests that we may need to stratify patients in order to match each patient to the right PT. In this concise review, we hope to assess potential PT-specific biomarkers for cancer treatment, with a focus on new studies, detection methods, new models and the opportunities this knowledge will bring for the development of novel PT-based anti-cancer strategies. We discuss the various \u201churdles\u201d that a given PT faces on its passage from the syringe to the tumor (and beyond), including the passage through the bloodstream, tumor targeting, tumor uptake and the intracellular release of the active agent. However, we also discuss other relevant concepts and new considerations in the field, which we hope will provide new insight into the possible applications of PT-related biomarkers.",

                    "text": "On its journey through the bloodstream, individual PTs will interact with a wide range of factors, leading to the formation of an adsorbed protein layer known as the protein corona [46,47] and opsonization, which can lead to enhanced PT clearance from the bloodstream, altered targeting (both inhibition and promotion) and the induction of toxicity [47]. Coronal factors include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), transferrin, fibrinogen and apolipoproteins, while antibodies, complement proteins and circulating proteins such as pentraxins, collectins and ficolins can all act as opsonizing agents. For a wider aspect on the importance of the protein corona to nanomedicine, we direct the reader to a recent excellent review [48]. \n\nThe formation of the protein corona not only depends on the type of polymer used [49,50] but also the specific physiological environments encountered [51], the duration of exposure [52,53] and also on the state of the patient being treated [54]. The latter study demonstrated that while protein corona formation on various nanomedicines displayed similarities between control and breast cancer patients, blood cancer patients and smokers demonstrated differing protein corona patterns in comparison to healthy controls [54]. Furthermore, genetic background, sex, life-style and race also strongly influence plasma protein levels in healthy individuals [55,56], which all contribute to patient-specific corona formation. \n\nAs mentioned, the formation of the protein corona on PT formulations can significantly affect PT targeting and, therefore overall efficiency. Meister et al. discovered that polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles containing the A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen (as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD)) became quickly decorated with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which actually aided the passage of the nanoparticle through the blood-brain-barrier [57]. Furthermore, a study by Papi et al. discovered that protein corona formation also increased cellular uptake of PEGylated liposomal irinotecan in the pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma cell line (PANC-1) [58].",

Atkinson, Zoraida Andreu, M. Vicent\n## Abstract\nPolymer therapeutics (PTs) provides a potentially exciting approach for the treatment of many diseases by enhancing aqueous solubility and altering drug pharmacokinetics at both the whole organism and subcellular level leading to improved therapeutic outcomes. However, the failure of many polymer-drug conjugates in clinical trials suggests that we may need to stratify patients in order to match each patient to the right PT. In this concise review, we hope to assess potential PT-specific biomarkers for cancer treatment, with a focus on new studies, detection methods, new models and the opportunities this knowledge will bring for the development of novel PT-based anti-cancer strategies. We discuss the various \u201churdles\u201d that a given PT faces on its passage from the syringe to the tumor (and beyond), including the passage through the bloodstream, tumor targeting, tumor uptake and the intracellular release of the active agent. However, we also discuss other relevant concepts and new considerations in the field, which we hope will provide new insight into the possible applications of PT-related biomarkers.\n## Protein Corona Formation/Opsonization\nOn its journey through the bloodstream, individual PTs will interact with a wide range of factors, leading to the formation of an adsorbed protein layer known as the protein corona [46,47] and opsonization, which can lead to enhanced PT clearance from the bloodstream, altered targeting (both inhibition and promotion) and the induction of toxicity [47]. Coronal factors include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), transferrin, fibrinogen and apolipoproteins, while antibodies, complement proteins and circulating proteins such as pentraxins, collectins and ficolins can all act as opsonizing agents. For a wider aspect on the importance of the protein corona to nanomedicine, we direct the reader to a recent excellent review [48]. \n\nThe formation of the protein corona not only depends on the type of polymer used [49,50] but also the specific physiological environments encountered [51], the duration of exposure [52,53] and also on the state of the patient being treated [54]. The latter study demonstrated that while protein corona formation on various nanomedicines displayed similarities between control and breast cancer patients, blood cancer patients and smokers demonstrated differing protein corona patterns in comparison to healthy controls [54]. Furthermore, genetic background, sex, life-style and race also strongly influence plasma protein levels in healthy individuals [55,56], which all contribute to patient-specific corona formation. \n\nAs mentioned, the formation of the protein corona on PT formulations can significantly affect PT targeting and, therefore overall efficiency. Meister et al. discovered that polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles containing the A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen (as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD)) became quickly decorated with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which actually aided the passage of the nanoparticle through the blood-brain-barrier [57]. Furthermore, a study by Papi et al. discovered that protein corona formation also increased cellular uptake of PEGylated liposomal irinotecan in the pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma cell line (PANC-1) [58].",

                    "text": "Nevertheless, each endothelium showed different uptake efficiency, with the brain endothelium showing the lowest nanoparticle uptake efficiency and liver and kidney endothelium showing the highest. These differences may reflect their different physiological functions, where the blood-brain barrier, in general, has a more selective uptake than liver sinusoids and kidney glomeruli. Similarly, after 5-h exposure (Figure 2 and Figure 3a,b) for the 100 nm carboxylated silica, cell fluorescence in the liver endothelium was higher than in the lung endothelium, while the opposite was observed for the 200 nm amino-modified silica, i.e., higher fluorescence in the lung endothelium. These differences in absolute uptake efficiency may relate to differences in the expression level and activity of the receptors and mechanisms that are responsible for the uptake of the corona-coated nanoparticles between different endothelial cell types. Exploiting such differences may enable novel targeting strategies. \n\nCorrelation between Protein Corona Composition and Nanoparticle Uptake. In order to identify corona proteins which affected nanoparticle uptake, we performed correlation analysis between cellular uptake levels after 5-h exposure (Figure 3a and 3b) and the corona composition of all 6 investigated silica nanoparticles using Pearson correlation (Figure 3c). A positive correlation (r \u2265 0.6), which indicates that a high amount of a certain protein in the corona correlated with higher uptake by cells, was observed in brain and lung endothelium for alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, immunoglobulins, human serum albumin (HSA), prothrombin, and transferrin. Interestingly, in the liver endothelium, a strong negative correlation (r \u2264 \u22120.6) was observed for some proteins including histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and no positive correlation. This lack of discrimination between proteins for uptake may be explained by the clearance function of scavenger endothelial cells of the liver. \n\nIn addition, we also performed correlation analysis based on nanoparticle uptake levels at 24 h (Table S1, Supporting Information).",

Overall, correlating the composition of the protein corona and nanoparticle uptake by cells allows for the identification of corona molecules that can be used to increase as well as to reduce nanoparticle uptake by cells.\n## \u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nNevertheless, each endothelium showed different uptake efficiency, with the brain endothelium showing the lowest nanoparticle uptake efficiency and liver and kidney endothelium showing the highest. These differences may reflect their different physiological functions, where the blood-brain barrier, in general, has a more selective uptake than liver sinusoids and kidney glomeruli. Similarly, after 5-h exposure (Figure 2 and Figure 3a,b) for the 100 nm carboxylated silica, cell fluorescence in the liver endothelium was higher than in the lung endothelium, while the opposite was observed for the 200 nm amino-modified silica, i.e., higher fluorescence in the lung endothelium. These differences in absolute uptake efficiency may relate to differences in the expression level and activity of the receptors and mechanisms that are responsible for the uptake of the corona-coated nanoparticles between different endothelial cell types. Exploiting such differences may enable novel targeting strategies. \n\nCorrelation between Protein Corona Composition and Nanoparticle Uptake. In order to identify corona proteins which affected nanoparticle uptake, we performed correlation analysis between cellular uptake levels after 5-h exposure (Figure 3a and 3b) and the corona composition of all 6 investigated silica nanoparticles using Pearson correlation (Figure 3c). A positive correlation (r \u2265 0.6), which indicates that a high amount of a certain protein in the corona correlated with higher uptake by cells, was observed in brain and lung endothelium for alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, immunoglobulins, human serum albumin (HSA), prothrombin, and transferrin. Interestingly, in the liver endothelium, a strong negative correlation (r \u2264 \u22120.6) was observed for some proteins including histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and no positive correlation. This lack of discrimination between proteins for uptake may be explained by the clearance function of scavenger endothelial cells of the liver. \n\nIn addition, we also performed correlation analysis based on nanoparticle uptake levels at 24 h (Table S1, Supporting Information).",

                    "text": "It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (64), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (65) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (65). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (33) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density. Thus, it appears that ApoE exerted distinct functions on NPs with low and high PEG densities. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that apolipoproteins involved in the trafficking of lipids in the bloodstream also impact on the in vivo clearance of NPs. \n\nOnce inside the cell, it is presumed that the protein corona is removed in phagolysosomes, causing the true \"identity\" of the NPs to be revealed (66).",

Fadeel\n## Abstract\nEngineered nanomaterials hold promise for a wide range of applications in medicine. However, safe use of nanomaterials requires that interactions with biological systems, not least with the immune system, are understood. Do nanomaterials elicit novel or unexpected effects, or is it possible to predict immune responses to nanomaterials based on how the immune system handles pathogens? How does the bio-corona of adsorbed biomolecules influence subsequent immune interactions of nanomaterials? How does the grafting of polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) onto nanomaterial surfaces impact on these interactions? Can ancient immune evasion or \u201cstealth\u201d strategies of pathogens inform the design of nanomaterials for biomedical applications? Can nanoparticles co-opt immune cells to target diseased tissues? The answers to these questions may prove useful for the development of nanomedicines.\n## CORONA FORMATION\nIt is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (64), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (65) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (65). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (33) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density. Thus, it appears that ApoE exerted distinct functions on NPs with low and high PEG densities. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that apolipoproteins involved in the trafficking of lipids in the bloodstream also impact on the in vivo clearance of NPs. \n\nOnce inside the cell, it is presumed that the protein corona is removed in phagolysosomes, causing the true \"identity\" of the NPs to be revealed (66).",

For example, apolipoprotein B and immunoglobulin G in the corona of 100 nm silica nanoparticles incubated with human serum were found to interact with their corresponding receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively [17]. Similarly, lipid nanoparticles were efficiently targeted to the hepatocytes upon adsorption of apoE on their surface following administration [52,53].

By changing these properties, the corona composition might be tuned to contain components that bind to specific cell surface receptors and initiate internalization [17,49,[55][56][57]. Similarly, artificial coronas can be formed to achieve recognition by specific receptors. For instance, Tonigold and colleagues have shown that pre-adsorbed antibodies, which could be seen as a form of preformed corona, kept, at least partially, their targeting ability in the presence of serum [40]. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the effects of the corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells are being more and more recognized [41,58,59].

            "abstract": "The long quest for efficient drug administration has been looking for a universal carrier that can precisely transport traditional drugs, new genomic and proteic therapeutic agents. Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.",

But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

Bastus, V. Puntes\n## Abstract\nThe long quest for efficient drug administration has been looking for a universal carrier that can precisely transport traditional drugs, new genomic and proteic therapeutic agents. Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.\n## Transformations and metabolization\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system. But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

Upon intravenous injection, nanoparticles are coated by a protein corona (PC). This confers a new biological identity on the particles that largely determines their biological fate. Liposomes have great pharmaceutical versatility, so, as proof of concept, their PC has recently been implicated in the mechanism and efficiency of their internalization into the cell. In an attempt to better understand the interactions between nanocarriers and biological systems, we analyzed the plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of multicomponent liposomes. Specifically, we analyzed the physical properties and ultrastructure of liposome/PC complexes and the aggregation process that occurs when liposomes are dispersed in plasma. The results of combined confocal microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that the PC favors liposome internalization by both macrophages and tumor cells. This work provides insights into the effects of the PC on liposomes\u2019 physical properties and, consequently, liposome\u2013liposome and liposome\u2013cell interactions.",

In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

Corbo, R. Molinaro, F. Taraballi, N. T. Toledano Furman, M. Sherman, A. Parodi, F. Salvatore, E. Tasciotti\n## Abstract\nA thorough understanding of interactions occurring at the interface between nanocarriers and biological systems is crucial to predict and interpret their biodistribution, targeting, and efficacy, and thus design more effective drug delivery systems. Upon intravenous injection, nanoparticles are coated by a protein corona (PC). This confers a new biological identity on the particles that largely determines their biological fate. Liposomes have great pharmaceutical versatility, so, as proof of concept, their PC has recently been implicated in the mechanism and efficiency of their internalization into the cell. In an attempt to better understand the interactions between nanocarriers and biological systems, we analyzed the plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of multicomponent liposomes. Specifically, we analyzed the physical properties and ultrastructure of liposome/PC complexes and the aggregation process that occurs when liposomes are dispersed in plasma. The results of combined confocal microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that the PC favors liposome internalization by both macrophages and tumor cells. This work provides insights into the effects of the PC on liposomes\u2019 physical properties and, consequently, liposome\u2013liposome and liposome\u2013cell interactions.\n## Introduction\nIn the last few decades, nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery platforms have improved the therapeutic index of many drugs. In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "abstract": "RNA-based therapeutics have shown great promise in various medical applications, including cancers, infectious diseases, and metabolic diseases. The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

                    "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

Of note, angiopep-2 (Ang) is a promising ligand bind specifically to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) receptor and can improve the BBB transport efficiency of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery [26][27][28]. \n\nNanoparticles interact with components in circulation after injection, leading to the formation of \"protein corona\" (PC), which changes the properties of nanoparticles and impact their in vivo fate [29]. It has been reported that the formation of PC on nanoparticles may hinder significantly the interaction between targeting ligand and receptor, thus losing targeting capabilities of ligand such as bicyclononyne [30] and transferrin [31]. Moreover, the PC on synthetic nanoparticle would impact the receptor targeting, lysosomal escape, and BBB transcytosis [32]. However, there are also studies reporting that targeting antibodies on nanoparticles could retain their targeting capacity despite the formation of biomolecular corona [33]. Although the understanding of the PC on nanoparticles has been advancing in recent years, little is known regarding whether PC formation could influence biomimetic nanoparticles' cellular uptake, BBB penetration and targeting capacity for precision brain drug delivery. \n\nIn this study, we assume that chimeric proteins on biomimetic nanoparticle would occupy the surface and decrease the impact of biomolecular corona thus retaining its natural properties and targeting ability of ligand. Here, we developed EM by incorporating membrane proteins onto liposomes for brain tumor drug delivery. Ang was decorated onto EM for enhancing the BBB penetration ability.

Exosomes are promising vehicles for brain tumor drug delivery, but the production and purification hinder its application for nanomedicine. Besides, the formation of protein corona (PC) may affect the behaviour of nanocarriers. Here, multifunctional exosomes-mimetics (EM) are developed and decorated with angiopep-2 (Ang) for enhancing GBM drug delivery by manipulating PC. Docetaxel (DTX)-loaded EM with Ang modification (DTX@Ang-EM) show less absorption of serum proteins and phagocytosis by macrophages. Ang-EM show enhanced BBB penetration ability and targeting ability to the GBM. Ang-EM-mediated delivery increase the concentration of DTX in the tumor area. The multifunctional DTX@Ang-EM exhibits significant inhibition effects on orthotopic GBM growth with reduced side effects of the chemotherapeutic. Findings from this study indicate that the developed DTX@Ang-EM provide a new strategy for targeted brain drug delivery and GBM therapy. Graphical abstract\n## Introduction\nHowever, biomimetic liposomes may still have limited ability for crossing the BBB. In recent years, several ligands such as transferrin [17][18][19], apolipoprotein E [20][21][22] and cyclic internalizing peptide [23][24][25] have been reported to be able to facilitate the penetration of nanoparticle to BBB for brain drug delivery. Of note, angiopep-2 (Ang) is a promising ligand bind specifically to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) receptor and can improve the BBB transport efficiency of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery [26][27][28]. \n\nNanoparticles interact with components in circulation after injection, leading to the formation of \"protein corona\" (PC), which changes the properties of nanoparticles and impact their in vivo fate [29]. It has been reported that the formation of PC on nanoparticles may hinder significantly the interaction between targeting ligand and receptor, thus losing targeting capabilities of ligand such as bicyclononyne [30] and transferrin [31]. Moreover, the PC on synthetic nanoparticle would impact the receptor targeting, lysosomal escape, and BBB transcytosis [32]. However, there are also studies reporting that targeting antibodies on nanoparticles could retain their targeting capacity despite the formation of biomolecular corona [33]. Although the understanding of the PC on nanoparticles has been advancing in recent years, little is known regarding whether PC formation could influence biomimetic nanoparticles' cellular uptake, BBB penetration and targeting capacity for precision brain drug delivery. \n\nIn this study, we assume that chimeric proteins on biomimetic nanoparticle would occupy the surface and decrease the impact of biomolecular corona thus retaining its natural properties and targeting ability of ligand. Here, we developed EM by incorporating membrane proteins onto liposomes for brain tumor drug delivery. Ang was decorated onto EM for enhancing the BBB penetration ability. We found that Ang-EM have reduced PC formation by absorbing less serum proteins.",

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

                    "text": "So far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal",

Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal of excess free proteins. The lower uptake could be related to specific differences in corona composition. For instance, a study on macrophages suggested that the presence of histidinerich glycoprotein in the corona is associated with a decreased uptake. 68 Here, similarly, the observed higher abundance of this protein in the corona formed at higher serum content could be one of the factors contributing to their lower uptake. Further studies are necessary to fully demonstrate similar effects connected to the relative abundance of individual proteins in the corona.\n\nNext to this, the results suggest that multiple uptake mechanisms seem involved at the same time in the uptake of nanoparticles. It has been previously hypothesized that, within a sample, multiple subpopulations of different coronas may be formed, 7 and this could explain\ue0d5at least in part\ue0d5the observed co-presence of different uptake mechanisms. More subtle changes of corona composition over time and during exposure to cells could also explain this observation. Further studies are required to fully characterize the molecular details of the mechanisms involved in each case, possibly combining the use of transport inhibitors and RNA interference with other methods, such as the use of genetically modified cells.\n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the importance of defining what the \"correct corona\" is for each nanomedicine (or nanoparticle) when investigating its behavior on cells. For instance, for nanomedicines administered by injection, not only higher serum content but also other factors likely to affect corona composition should be considered, such as the presence of blood flow and the more complex composition of plasma in vivo (as opposed to the serum used here). 13,36 Similar considerations should also be applied to nanomedicines administered via different routes, for instance inhaled or ingested nanomedicines, for which a serum corona may be not relevant. Additionally, other more complex factors such as the evolution of corona composition over time and changes due to the interaction with secreted cellular biomolecules may also affect the uptake mechanisms",

Reker-Smit, I. Nelissen, A. Salvati\n## Abstract\nNanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSo far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal\n...\ninteresting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal of excess free proteins. The lower uptake could be related to specific differences in corona composition. For instance, a study on macrophages suggested that the presence of histidinerich glycoprotein in the corona is associated with a decreased uptake. 68 Here, similarly, the observed higher abundance of this protein in the corona formed at higher serum content could be one of the factors contributing to their lower uptake. Further studies are necessary to fully demonstrate similar effects connected to the relative abundance of individual proteins in the corona.\n\nNext to this, the results suggest that multiple uptake mechanisms seem involved at the same time in the uptake of nanoparticles. It has been previously hypothesized that, within a sample, multiple subpopulations of different coronas may be formed, 7 and this could explain\ue0d5at least in part\ue0d5the observed co-presence of different uptake mechanisms. More subtle changes of corona composition over time and during exposure to cells could also explain this observation. Further studies are required to fully characterize the molecular details of the mechanisms involved in each case, possibly combining the use of transport inhibitors and RNA interference with other methods, such as the use of genetically modified cells.\n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the importance of defining what the \"correct corona\" is for each nanomedicine (or nanoparticle) when investigating its behavior on cells. For instance, for nanomedicines administered by injection, not only higher serum content but also other factors likely to affect corona composition should be considered, such as the presence of blood flow and the more complex composition of plasma in vivo (as opposed to the serum used here). 13,36 Similar considerations should also be applied to nanomedicines administered via different routes, for instance inhaled or ingested nanomedicines, for which a serum corona may be not relevant. Additionally, other more complex factors such as the evolution of corona composition over time and changes due to the interaction with secreted cellular biomolecules may also affect the uptake mechanisms",

Traditional therapies, although pivotal in managing cancer, encounter considerable challenges, including drug resistance, poor drug solubility, and difficulties targeting tumors, specifically limiting their overall efficacy. Nanomedicine\u2019s application in cancer therapy signals a new epoch, distinguished by the improvement of the specificity, efficacy, and tolerability of cancer treatments. This review explores the mechanisms and advantages of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery, highlighting passive and active targeting strategies. Furthermore, it explores the transformative potential of nanomedicine in tumor therapeutics, delving into its applications across various treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic and photothermal therapy, gene therapy, as well as tumor diagnosis and imaging. Meanwhile, the outlook of nanomedicine in tumor therapeutics is discussed, emphasizing the need for addressing toxicity concerns, improving drug delivery strategies, enhancing carrier stability and controlled release, simplifying nano-design, and exploring novel manufacturing technologies. Overall, integrating nanomedicine in cancer treatment holds immense potential for revolutionizing cancer therapeutics and improving patient outcomes.",

                    "text": "This protein layer significantly influences the biological behavior of nanocarriers by altering their physicochemical properties and can ultimately control their in vivo fate. This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona [38]. Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics [39]. On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake [39]. In summary, an in-depth understanding of protein corona and its complex interactions with NPs is essential in designing effective nanocarrier systems for therapeutic delivery. \n\nAfter discussing cellular targeting, another significant component of active targeting, known as transcytosis nanomedicine, warrants our attention [40]. In contrast to the classical active targeting mechanism, which predominantly involves the binding of nanomedicine to cell surface receptors, transcytosis nanomedicine takes a step further. It is designed to be transported across cells, exploiting cellular machinery to transport nanomedicine from one side of the cell to the other. This process is beneficial in crossing biological barriers that are otherwise hard to penetrate, such as the blood-brain barrier or that of specific dense tumoral tissues. The application of transcytosis nanomedicine becomes especially significant in cancer therapy, where the tumor microenvironment (TME) often presents a formidable challenge to conventional drug delivery methods. By utilizing transcytosis nanomedicine, we can enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues, improving the efficacy of the treatment while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

Traditional therapies, although pivotal in managing cancer, encounter considerable challenges, including drug resistance, poor drug solubility, and difficulties targeting tumors, specifically limiting their overall efficacy. Nanomedicine\u2019s application in cancer therapy signals a new epoch, distinguished by the improvement of the specificity, efficacy, and tolerability of cancer treatments. This review explores the mechanisms and advantages of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery, highlighting passive and active targeting strategies. Furthermore, it explores the transformative potential of nanomedicine in tumor therapeutics, delving into its applications across various treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic and photothermal therapy, gene therapy, as well as tumor diagnosis and imaging. Meanwhile, the outlook of nanomedicine in tumor therapeutics is discussed, emphasizing the need for addressing toxicity concerns, improving drug delivery strategies, enhancing carrier stability and controlled release, simplifying nano-design, and exploring novel manufacturing technologies. Overall, integrating nanomedicine in cancer treatment holds immense potential for revolutionizing cancer therapeutics and improving patient outcomes.\n## Active Targeting\nThis protein layer significantly influences the biological behavior of nanocarriers by altering their physicochemical properties and can ultimately control their in vivo fate. This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona [38]. Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics [39]. On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake [39]. In summary, an in-depth understanding of protein corona and its complex interactions with NPs is essential in designing effective nanocarrier systems for therapeutic delivery. \n\nAfter discussing cellular targeting, another significant component of active targeting, known as transcytosis nanomedicine, warrants our attention [40]. In contrast to the classical active targeting mechanism, which predominantly involves the binding of nanomedicine to cell surface receptors, transcytosis nanomedicine takes a step further. It is designed to be transported across cells, exploiting cellular machinery to transport nanomedicine from one side of the cell to the other. This process is beneficial in crossing biological barriers that are otherwise hard to penetrate, such as the blood-brain barrier or that of specific dense tumoral tissues. The application of transcytosis nanomedicine becomes especially significant in cancer therapy, where the tumor microenvironment (TME) often presents a formidable challenge to conventional drug delivery methods. By utilizing transcytosis nanomedicine, we can enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues, improving the efficacy of the treatment while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

            "abstract": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.\n## Introduction\nPharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

This modulation affects the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, influencing pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and targeting capability. However, the protein corona can also be utilized as a strategy to target nanoparticles to specific tissues [32]. Different researchers have utilized small molecules, including antioxidant compounds, peptides, and antibodies, for inhibiting pathological protein aggregation. Also, several lipidic nanoparticles have been developed to target neurodegeneration associated with AD (Table 1). Specifically, dual-modified liposomes with ApoE-derived peptides for BBB targeting and phosphatidic acid for A\u03b2 binding have demonstrated promising potential in addressing AD pathology. Research studies involving APP/PS1 and APP23 transgenic mice highlight the effectiveness of this formulation in reducing amyloid load. This was indicated by a decrease in both plasma and brain A\u03b2 levels [33]. Furthermore, liposomes loaded with the antioxidants quercetin and rosmarinic acid, incorporating apolipoprotein E and phosphatidic acid, have been successful in repairing A\u03b21-42-induced neurotoxicity in AD due to enhanced BBB penetration. This liposomal formulation exhibited neuroprotective effects by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, and A\u03b2 plaque formation in the brain of AD rat models [34]. \n\nOxidative stress, particularly due to lipid peroxidation in the brain, has long been linked to AD neurodegeneration [35]. Several clinical trials have been evaluating the use of the antioxidant curcumin in AD [36], but its hydrophobicity often results in poor bioavailability [37].",

The formation of protein corona is complicated and irreversible in the biological environment, and protein corona will redefine the \u201cbiological identity\u201d of NPs, which will alter the following biological events and therapeutic efficacy. Current understanding of protein corona is still limited and incomplete, and in many cases, protein corona has adverse impacts on nanomedicine, for instance, losing targeting ability, activating the immune response, and rapid clearance. Due to the considerable role of protein corona in NPs\u2019 biological fate, harnessing protein corona to achieve some therapeutic effects through various methods like biomimetic approaches is now treated as a promising way to meet the current challenges in nanomedicine such as poor pharmacokinetic properties, off-target effect, and immunogenicity.

However, clinical translation is still largely hindered by several factors, and the rapidly formed protein corona on the surface of NPs is one of them. The formation of protein corona is complicated and irreversible in the biological environment, and protein corona will redefine the \u201cbiological identity\u201d of NPs, which will alter the following biological events and therapeutic efficacy. Current understanding of protein corona is still limited and incomplete, and in many cases, protein corona has adverse impacts on nanomedicine, for instance, losing targeting ability, activating the immune response, and rapid clearance. Due to the considerable role of protein corona in NPs\u2019 biological fate, harnessing protein corona to achieve some therapeutic effects through various methods like biomimetic approaches is now treated as a promising way to meet the current challenges in nanomedicine such as poor pharmacokinetic properties, off-target effect, and immunogenicity. This review will first introduce the current understanding of protein corona and summarize the investigation process and technologies. Second, the strategies of harnessing protein corona with biomimetic approaches for nanomedicine design are reviewed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future outlooks of biomimetic approaches to tune protein corona in nanomedicine.\n## Introduction\nWith many excellent properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been treated as promising drug delivery systems for therapeutic purposes, like efficient and safe drug delivery without off-target effects [1,2]. Even though much attention has been paid to the development of NPs, there is still a huge gap between current NP therapy and efficient delivery systems [2]. One of the most critical factors that hinder the clinical translation of NP therapy is the complicated and unpredictable interaction between NPs and biological fluids that occur after the administration of NPs [3]. The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces [4]. This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs [5]. Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity [6][7][8]. As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs [9]. They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the rules and mechanisms of protein corona formation and understand the influence of protein corona in NPs therapy, which will provide guidance for the rational design of NPs and accelerate the clinical translation speed of NP therapy. \n\nThe formation of protein corona is rapid, temporally dynamic, contextually dependent, stochastic, and irreversible [2,10,11].\n\n## Endogenous Protein Coating for Targeting Effect\nBy preventing the protein corona formation, the pre-coating in this system played a dual role: enhancing the targeting ability of cancer cells and reducing serum protein adsorption for a prolonged circulation time (Figure 8B). Apart from the ability to harness protein corona and tumor targeting, the bio-inspired pre-coating could also increase the stability of this NP system under the lysosomal acid environment and reduce its cytotoxicity. The anti-cancer cell proliferation and anti-tumor proliferation effects were studied in vitro and in vivo, proving that precoating the functional biomimetic albumin is an excellent and promising strategy for better drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic effects. Han Yang et al. showed another bio-inspired NP system pre-coated with cyclic RGDyK peptide (cRGD) modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) for impeding the formation of the protein corona, enhancing targeting ability to tumor cells, increasing delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs and improving therapeutic effects [79]. By preventing the protein corona formation, the pre-coating in this system played a dual role: enhancing the targeting ability of cancer cells and reducing serum protein adsorption for a prolonged circulation time (Figure 8B). Apart from the ability to harness protein corona Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona [80].",

Given the inevitable interactions, we regard nanoparticle\u2012protein interactions as a tool for designing protein corona-mediated drug delivery systems. Herein, we demonstrate the successful application of protein corona-mediated brain-targeted nanomicelles in the treatment of glioma, loading them with paclitaxel (PTX), and decorating them with amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2)-CN peptide (PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs). A\u03b2-CN peptide, like the A\u03b2 1\u201342 peptide, specifically binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in vivo to form the ApoE-enriched protein corona surrounding A\u03b2-CN-PMs (ApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs). The receptor-binding domain of the ApoE then combines with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and LDLr-related protein 1 receptor (LRP1r) expressed in the blood\u2013brain barrier and glioma, effectively mediating brain-targeted delivery. Methods PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were prepared using a film hydration method with sonication, which was simple and feasible. The specific formation of the ApoE-enriched protein corona around nanoparticles was characterized by Western blotting analysis and LC\u2013MS/MS. The in vitro physicochemical properties and in vivo anti-glioma effects of PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were also well studied. Results The average size and zeta potential of PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs and ApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs were 103.1\u00a0nm, 172.3\u00a0nm, 7.23\u00a0mV, and 0.715\u00a0mV, respectively. PTX was efficiently loaded into PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs, and the PTX release from rhApoE/PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs exhibited a sustained-release pattern in vitro. The formation of the ApoE-enriched protein corona significantly improved the cellular uptake of A\u03b2-CN-PMs on C6 cells\u00a0and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)\u00a0and enhanced permeability to the blood\u2013brain tumor barrier in vitro. Meanwhile, PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs with ApoE-enriched protein corona had a greater ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis than taxol. Importantly, PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs exhibited better anti-glioma effects and tissue distribution profile with rapid accumulation in glioma tissues in vivo and prolonged median survival of glioma-bearing mice compared to those associated with PMs without the ApoE protein corona. Conclusions The designed PTX/A\u03b2-CN-PMs exhibited significantly enhanced anti-glioma efficacy. Importantly, this study provided a strategy for the rational design of a protein corona-based brain-targeted drug delivery system. More crucially, we utilized the unfavorable side of the protein corona and converted it into an advantage to achieve brain-targeted drug delivery. Graphical Abstract",

The formation of a PC changes the size, surface charge, aggregation state, and targeting properties of NPs, which ultimately determines the biological identity of NPs [15]. The biological identity of NPs plays an important role in the drug delivery, circulation time, cellular uptake, and cell recognition of NPs [16].

Upon introduction to a complex biological system, nanomaterials dynamically interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein \u201cbio-corona.\u201d The decoration with these surface biomolecules endows nanoparticles with new properties. The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons.",

Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "abstract": "Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is \u201cread\u201d by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.",

                    "text": "While the above approaches allow to more accurately identify which corona components play a role in nanoparticle uptake, the next important aspect to unravel is which cell receptors are involved (Figure 2C). Thus, following the identification of all possible interacting receptors based on corona composition and/or epitope mapping, it is important to verify which of them can actually recognize and bind to the corona and if such recognition and the interaction with those receptors also lead to nanoparticle internalization. For instance, Caracciolo et al. (2013) showed that abundant adsorption of vitronectin from human plasma on lipid nanoparticles promoted nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells overexpressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the uptake. Epitope mapping can also be used to predict the involvement of certain receptors. In the study by Lara et al. (2017) discussed above, epitope mapping showed exposure of apolipoprotein B-100 and the Fc region of IgG in the biomolecular corona of 100 nm silica (Figures 4A,B). Then, the authors also showed that in cells overexpressing their receptors, i.e., the LDL receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively, nanoparticle uptake was enhanced (see Figures 4C,D for LDL receptor), while adding LDL reduced it (Figure 4E). These results suggested that nanoparticle uptake was mediated by recognition of the biomolecular corona by these specific receptors. These studies also showed that the biomolecular corona can be recognized by multiple receptors in the same cells. Interactions with multiple receptors may lead to uptake via multiple pathways. In line with this, Francia et al. (2019) showed that 50 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles coated with a different corona (in low or high amounts of human serum) interacted with different receptors and consecutively were internalized by cells using different pathways. Thus, the interaction of the corona with specific cell receptors can also affect the mechanisms cells use for nanoparticle internalization. \n\nGiven the wide variety of proteins constituting the biomolecular corona, it has also emerged that more complex motifs can be formed in this layer.",

                    "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

Zuhorn, A. Salvati\n## Abstract\nNanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is \u201cread\u201d by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.\n## THE ROLE OF THE BIOMOLECULAR CORONA IN NANOPARTICLE UPTAKE\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).\n\n## Associating Corona Composition With Nanoparticle Uptake\nIdentification of all corona components, for instance by proteomics, is the very first step toward understanding nanoparticle corona interactions with cell receptors. Then, the next step is to identify which actual components of the biomolecular corona are responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake (Figure 2A). Dissecting the biomolecular corona could be extremely challenging, given the high complexity of this layer. However, in recent years, a straightforward approach has been developed to make this possible. The idea was based on using a library consisting of nanoparticles with various physicochemical properties to tune the corona composition and then associating the abundance of certain corona proteins with the nanoparticle cellular uptake efficiency. One way to do it is by applying quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict nanoparticle-cell association as introduced by Walkey et al. (2014). To this end, a combination of biophysical, biological, and bioinformatic methods is required, as illustrated in Figure 3. The study showed that, by using a library containing more than 100 nanoparticle formulations and measuring their uptake by cells, this approach enabled the identification of 39 proteins classified as promoters, e.g., \u03b1-1 microglobulin and hyaluronanbinding protein 2, and of 25 inhibitors of cell association, e.g. complement C3. Similarly, Palchetti et al. (2016) used this approach to predict cell association of 16 lipid nanoparticles. \n\nInterestingly, they showed that only 8 protein corona fingerprints were shown to be the most important stimulators of nanoparticle uptake in HeLa cells. In another study, similar approaches were used to identify liposomal formulations with a corona fingerprint that allowed increased uptake in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Palchetti et al., 2019).\n\n## Identification of Cellular Receptors That Interact With the Biomolecular Corona\nWhile the above approaches allow to more accurately identify which corona components play a role in nanoparticle uptake, the next important aspect to unravel is which cell receptors are involved (Figure 2C). Thus, following the identification of all possible interacting receptors based on corona composition and/or epitope mapping, it is important to verify which of them can actually recognize and bind to the corona and if such recognition and the interaction with those receptors also lead to nanoparticle internalization. For instance, Caracciolo et al. (2013) showed that abundant adsorption of vitronectin from human plasma on lipid nanoparticles promoted nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells overexpressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the uptake. Epitope mapping can also be used to predict the involvement of certain receptors. In the study by Lara et al. (2017) discussed above, epitope mapping showed exposure of apolipoprotein B-100 and the Fc region of IgG in the biomolecular corona of 100 nm silica (Figures 4A,B). Then, the authors also showed that in cells overexpressing their receptors, i.e., the LDL receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively, nanoparticle uptake was enhanced (see Figures 4C,D for LDL receptor), while adding LDL reduced it (Figure 4E). These results suggested that nanoparticle uptake was mediated by recognition of the biomolecular corona by these specific receptors. These studies also showed that the biomolecular corona can be recognized by multiple receptors in the same cells. Interactions with multiple receptors may lead to uptake via multiple pathways. In line with this, Francia et al. (2019) showed that 50 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles coated with a different corona (in low or high amounts of human serum) interacted with different receptors and consecutively were internalized by cells using different pathways. Thus, the interaction of the corona with specific cell receptors can also affect the mechanisms cells use for nanoparticle internalization. \n\nGiven the wide variety of proteins constituting the biomolecular corona, it has also emerged that more complex motifs can be formed in this layer.",

As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.",

Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

Paulusse\n## Abstract\nSafe and reliable entry to the brain is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but it still poses major challenges. As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.\n## Protein Corona\nProtein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

In recent years, transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery modalities offer promising avenues with multiple advantages, such as non-invasion, avoided liver first-pass effect and improved patient compliance. Considering the rapid development of gene therapeutics via transdermal and transpulmonary administration, here we aim to summarize the nearest advances in transdermal and transpulmonary gene drug delivery. In this review, we firstly elaborate on current delivery carrier in gene therapy. We, further, describe approaches and applications for enhancing transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery encompassing microneedles, chemical enhancers, physical methods for transdermal administration as well as nebulized formulations, dry powder formulations, and pressurized metered dose formulations for efficient transpulmonary delivery. Last but not least, the opportunities and outlooks of gene therapy through both administrated routes are highlighted.",

                    "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

However, effective gene delivery remains a formidable challenge to overcome. The presence of degrading enzymes, acidic pH conditions, and the gastrointestinal mucus layer pose significant barriers for genetic therapy, necessitating exploration of alternative therapeutic options. In recent years, transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery modalities offer promising avenues with multiple advantages, such as non-invasion, avoided liver first-pass effect and improved patient compliance. Considering the rapid development of gene therapeutics via transdermal and transpulmonary administration, here we aim to summarize the nearest advances in transdermal and transpulmonary gene drug delivery. In this review, we firstly elaborate on current delivery carrier in gene therapy. We, further, describe approaches and applications for enhancing transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery encompassing microneedles, chemical enhancers, physical methods for transdermal administration as well as nebulized formulations, dry powder formulations, and pressurized metered dose formulations for efficient transpulmonary delivery. Last but not least, the opportunities and outlooks of gene therapy through both administrated routes are highlighted.\n## Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)\nIn vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

This biomolecular interface organization causes the nanosystems to obtain new b logical characteristics, which will be presented in Section 3.2. The process of PC formati depends on the competition among the proteins that are to be adsorbed.",

Navarro-Marchal, J. M. Peula-Garc\u00eda, A. B. J\u00f3dar-Reyes\n## Abstract\nNanomedicine against cancer, including diagnosis, prevention and treatment, has increased expectations for the solution of many biomedical challenges in the fight against this disease. In recent decades, an exhaustive design of nanosystems with high specificity, sensitivity and selectivity has been achieved due to a rigorous control over their physicochemical properties and an understanding of the nano\u2013bio interface. However, despite the considerable progress that has been reached in this field, there are still different hurdles that limit the clinical application of these nanosystems, which, along with their possible solutions, have been reviewed in this work. Specifically, physiological processes as biological barriers and protein corona formation related to the administration routes, designing strategies to overcome these obstacles, promising new multifunctional nanotherapeutics, and recent clinical trials are presented in this review.\n## Physicochemical Properties of Nanosystems and Protein Corona Formation\nThe interaction between the nanosystem and the physiological environment will lead to the adsorption of different biomolecules, such as proteins and lipids, on their surface. This process is called \"protein corona\" formation (PC) [11,12]. \n\nThe opsonisation process that nanoparticles (NPs) undergo after administration into the bloodstream involves the adsorption of plasma proteins, including serum albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, apolipoproteins, complement components such as C3b, and immunoglobulins such as IgG or IgM. After this, MPS sequestration will take place. This sequestration is achieved through the binding of these PC proteins to specific receptors on the surface of the phagocytes that are responsible for the removal of pathogens and negatively charged ligands circulating in the blood. This ligand-receptor recognition causes the internalization of NPs, their transport to phagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes [8,12,13] (Figure 3). \n\nThe opsonisation process that nanoparticles (NPs) undergo after administration in the bloodstream involves the adsorption of plasma proteins, including serum album fibrinogen, fibronectin, apolipoproteins, complement components such as C3b, and i munoglobulins such as IgG or IgM.

We view this biomolecular corona as a component of a much broader non-cellular blood interactome that can be highly specific to the organism, akin to components of the innate immune response to an invading pathogen. We review published supporting data and generalize these notions from artificial nanoparticles to viruses and bacteria. Characterization of the non-cellular blood interactome of an organism may help explain apparent differences in the susceptibility to pathogens among individuals. The non-cellular blood interactome is a candidate therapeutic target to treat infectious and non-infectious conditions.",

                    "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

Hardy, Hassan Sarker, C. Fernandez-Patron\n## Abstract\nWe advance the notion that much like artificial nanoparticles, relatively more complex biological entities with nanometric dimensions such as pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms) may also acquire a biomolecular corona upon entering the blood circulation of an organism. We view this biomolecular corona as a component of a much broader non-cellular blood interactome that can be highly specific to the organism, akin to components of the innate immune response to an invading pathogen. We review published supporting data and generalize these notions from artificial nanoparticles to viruses and bacteria. Characterization of the non-cellular blood interactome of an organism may help explain apparent differences in the susceptibility to pathogens among individuals. The non-cellular blood interactome is a candidate therapeutic target to treat infectious and non-infectious conditions.\n## Artificial Nanoparticles and Their 'Acquired Protein Coronas'\n). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

Therapeutic delivery of macromolecules into cells requires overcoming substantially higher barriers compared to the use of small molecule drugs or proteins in the extracellular space. Breakthroughs like DNA delivery for approved gene therapies and RNA delivery for silencing of genes (patisiran, ONPATTRO\u00ae, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) or for vaccination such as the RNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines demonstrated the feasibility of using macromolecules inside cells for therapy. Chemical carriers are part of the reason why these novel RNA-based therapeutics possess sufficient efficacy for their clinical application. A clear advantage of synthetic chemicals as carriers for macromolecule delivery is their favourable properties with respect to production and storage compared to more bioinspired vehicles like viral vectors or more complex drugs like cellular therapies. If biologicals can be applied to intracellular targets, the druggable space is substantially broadened by circumventing the limited utility of small molecules for blocking protein\u2013protein interactions and the limitation of protein-based drugs to the extracellular space. An in depth understanding of the macromolecular cargo types, carrier types and the cell biology of delivery is crucial for optimal application and further development of biologicals inside cells. Basic mechanistic principles of the molecular and cell biological aspects of cytosolic/nuclear delivery of macromolecules, with particular consideration of protein delivery, are reviewed here. The efficiency of macromolecule delivery and applications in research and therapy are highlighted.",

                    "text": "Stability issues related to in vivo conditions may include chemical and colloidal stability. Cargoes can be exposed to enzymes like, for example, RNAses in the extracellular space [274]. The in vivo environment can affect stability by affecting the nanoparticle's aggregation propensity [275]. High ionic strength in biological fluids may affect the tendency of nanoparticles to aggregate [275,276]. For example, DNA/PEI complexes aggregated at physiological ion concentrations to large particles of up to approximately a micrometre in size [275,276]. Carriers may also form aggregates with cells in the blood stream [277]. Aggregate size may influence the endocytic uptake route taken [278], and if aggregate sizes are large enough, they embolize capillaries [8,279]. Shear forces and the adherence of serum proteins like albumin contributed to the dissociation of polymer micelles as observed from in vitro experiments and in blood vessels of mice [262,280]. \n\nNon-specific adsorption of biomolecules on nanoparticles from the environment can form a \"corona\" on the particle surface in vivo [90,156,275,281,282], and its composition depends on particle-size and particle-surface properties [283] as well as tissue-specific presence, adsorption or desorption of proteins in the environment of the particle [90,284]. The corona can influence tissue distribution, cellular delivery efficiency and circulation times of the drug [90,285,286]. As an example, if apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is adsorbed to carriers or if components of the carriers mimic ApoE, this influences the distribution of carriers by targeting to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and subsequent delivery to hepatocytes [90,286,287]. Plasma proteins that have been reported to interact with lipid-based carriers and to influence their in vivo performance include highly abundant proteins like albumin, which may cause destabilization of particles or proteins that promote clearance by the immune system like complement proteins or immunoglobulins [288].",

A clear advantage of synthetic chemicals as carriers for macromolecule delivery is their favourable properties with respect to production and storage compared to more bioinspired vehicles like viral vectors or more complex drugs like cellular therapies. If biologicals can be applied to intracellular targets, the druggable space is substantially broadened by circumventing the limited utility of small molecules for blocking protein\u2013protein interactions and the limitation of protein-based drugs to the extracellular space. An in depth understanding of the macromolecular cargo types, carrier types and the cell biology of delivery is crucial for optimal application and further development of biologicals inside cells. Basic mechanistic principles of the molecular and cell biological aspects of cytosolic/nuclear delivery of macromolecules, with particular consideration of protein delivery, are reviewed here. The efficiency of macromolecule delivery and applications in research and therapy are highlighted.\n## Extracellular Barrier: In Vivo Stability\nStability issues related to in vivo conditions may include chemical and colloidal stability. Cargoes can be exposed to enzymes like, for example, RNAses in the extracellular space [274]. The in vivo environment can affect stability by affecting the nanoparticle's aggregation propensity [275]. High ionic strength in biological fluids may affect the tendency of nanoparticles to aggregate [275,276]. For example, DNA/PEI complexes aggregated at physiological ion concentrations to large particles of up to approximately a micrometre in size [275,276]. Carriers may also form aggregates with cells in the blood stream [277]. Aggregate size may influence the endocytic uptake route taken [278], and if aggregate sizes are large enough, they embolize capillaries [8,279]. Shear forces and the adherence of serum proteins like albumin contributed to the dissociation of polymer micelles as observed from in vitro experiments and in blood vessels of mice [262,280]. \n\nNon-specific adsorption of biomolecules on nanoparticles from the environment can form a \"corona\" on the particle surface in vivo [90,156,275,281,282], and its composition depends on particle-size and particle-surface properties [283] as well as tissue-specific presence, adsorption or desorption of proteins in the environment of the particle [90,284]. The corona can influence tissue distribution, cellular delivery efficiency and circulation times of the drug [90,285,286]. As an example, if apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is adsorbed to carriers or if components of the carriers mimic ApoE, this influences the distribution of carriers by targeting to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and subsequent delivery to hepatocytes [90,286,287]. Plasma proteins that have been reported to interact with lipid-based carriers and to influence their in vivo performance include highly abundant proteins like albumin, which may cause destabilization of particles or proteins that promote clearance by the immune system like complement proteins or immunoglobulins [288].",

As the interface between NPs and cells or molecules, a protein corona is essential to the biological effects of NPs and even affects their therapeutic efficiency. More than 90% of NPs are removed by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo , causing serious off-target effects and toxicity. However, monocyte phagocytosis of NPs may be affected by the formation of a protein corona, thus extending or shortening their blood circulation period and presenting opportunities or challenges to drug delivery design. There are four directions are proposed to discuss the influence of protein deposition on NPs, mainly classifying as follows: (i) targeting ligands are shrouded to cause reduced binding capability with tumor receptor, (ii) bioavailability is declined owing to enhanced uptake of macrophage, (iii) promote NP hydrodynamic size increasement, and (iv) deep penetration with tumor tissue is avoided by inducing NP aggregation. By changing its surface characteristics, the protein corona of NPs may affect the crossing of several biological barriers ( e.g., BBB), cell uptake, and targeting capability. Therefore, lipid NPs have been decorated by incubation with ApoE4 to enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in the brain [51] . The design principle is dependent on the high affinity between ApoE and specific receptors in the BBB. For instance, the modification of ApoE4 into polysorbate 80-stabilized lipid NPs produces an artificial protein corona, improving the BBBpenetrating capability 3-fold higher than that of naked NPs. Tf, a common target molecule with a high affinity for TfR, is used to modify the surface of nanocarriers to improve BBB penetration and tumor-targeting accumulation. The receptormediated transmembrane transport in the BBB is usually divided into three parts: the targeted molecules on the surface of NPs are recognized by cell membrane proteins for endocytosis, intracellular transport of NPs, and efflux of NPs.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles enter a biological fluid, proteins rapidly compete for binding to the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a protein corona that critically defines the biological identity of the particle. The properties of such a particle-protein complex differ significantly from those of the formulated particle. Hence, the further biological responses of the body as well as the biodistribution of the nanoparticles are expected to be influenced by the nanoparticle-protein complex [34]. Therefore, the PLA nanoparticles were incubated with human blood plasma for several time points and we examined the binding of plasma proteins to the nanoparticles. The protein binding profiles were visualized by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that an exposure for five minutes was already sufficient for an efficient corona formation ( Figure 7A). Also, the amount of corona proteins increased over time, albeit the corona seems to change only quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Furthermore, we examined the presence of apolipoproteins in the protein corona ( Figure 7B). Apolipoproteins are part of the circulating lipoproteins and serve as receptor ligands for lipid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and it was suggested that apolipoprotein-modified nanoparticles are able to transport drugs across the BBB [35][36][37][38]. We observed that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) are already present in the nanoparticle-protein complex after five minutes of exposure, and that the amount of ApoA4 slightly decreased and the ApoE concentrations significantly increased over time. The formation of the apolipoprotein corona on the PLA nanoparticles indicates a potential transport route of the nanoparticles through a lipoprotein receptor transcytosis pathway [37,39].",

            "text": "24 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed, such as fetal bovine serum, human serum, or plasma, 27 and even in the same fluid, when the ratio between nanoparticle and fluid concentration is changed. 28 It has also been shown that the composition of this layer evolves over time or for instance during nanoparticle exposure to cells, because of adsorption of biomolecules secreted by cells in the medium. 21,22,29,30 Importantly, several studies have highlighted that the corona composition affects nanoparticle\u2212cell association 31 and that corona proteins can engage with specific cell receptors. 10,20,32,33 For instance, it has been shown that the uptake of silica nanoparticles is mediated by the recognition of corona proteins by the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 10 However, it is not known yet whether the corona composition and the initial recognition of corona proteins by specific cell receptors also affect the following mechanism cells use to internalize the nanoparticles.\n\nTo this aim, in this work we characterized and compared the mechanisms of uptake of nanoparticles dispersed in media containing two very different serum concentrations, a high serum content close to protein concentration in blood (roughly 60 mg/mL) and a 5 times lower one. Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

It seems that complement, immunoglobulin, acute phase and lipoproteins mostly influence the phagocytosis 41 . Herein, lipoproteins had higher abundance in protein corona composition of the PECs in compare with FBS. \n\ncellular in vitro study. Effects of serum and pH on uptake of nanoparticles. To find the correlation between structural parameters, medium condition, protein corona, and cellular uptake of PECs, this set of PECs was selected for in vitro tests to simultaneously evaluate effects of D/Ch ratio, thiolation of dextran, Ch Mw, PEC size, and their zeta potential on cellular uptake of the PECs. Furthermore, effects of FBS and pH of the medium on uptake of the PECs were studied. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found out that uptake of the PECs was noticeably enhanced by FBS (p < 0.05). However, it was not significant for the thiolated PEC composed of Ch18 with D/Ch ratio of 0.2 in acidic medium, and Ch-DNA complex in the medium with pH, 7.4. Previous researches indicated that serum proteins influence uptake of nanoparticles by cells as the structurally same nanoparticles can lead to very different biological outcomes in the presence or absence of protein corona 55 . Herein, different parameters have reverse effects on the test results. First, FBS lead to an increase in uptake of the PECs because cell function rises by addition of serum. Second, interaction of nanoparticles with serum proteins leads to an increase in size of the nanoparticles and changes their surface properties such as zeta potential, consequently, it decreases PEC uptake. Third, existence of some proteins in corona such as inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins could enhance the cellular uptake 56,57 .",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

Clusterin was also detected in our hard corona proteins, but at very low levels (<1% in both micelle However, we found albumin and various apolipoproteins, mainly apolipoproteins A-I and E, to be prominent in the protein corona recovered from both micelles. Apolipoproteins generally exhibit dysopsonic function, as reported previously [50,52]. In summary, even though immune relevant proteins, such as immunoglobulins, were present in high percentages in the hard corona recovered from our micelles, in particular in the case of PEG5K, we also found an enrichment of dysopsonins, such as albumin and apolipoproteins. The presence of dysopsonins might antagonize the biological effects of micelle-bound opsonins [55], leading to a limited decrease in cellular uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells.",

            "text": "The biological interactions between nanoparticles and circulatory proteins lead to the formation of \"protein corona\" [ 153 ]. This effect influences the nanoparticles uptake (via selective receptor-mediated targeting), lysosomal/endosome escape, transcytosis across the BBB/penetration across the BBTB, intracellular trafficking, and exocytosis from BCECs etc. Certain studies reported that targeted synthetic nanoparticles, although they enter the tumor cells, however, they lose brain tumor targeting specificity due to alterations in their protein structure, orientation, and/or functions. The binding of nanoparticles to opsonin, such as immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, complement components (C3/C4), etc., showed rapid clearance from RES and subsequently triggered immune responses. For instance, folic-acid receptor-targeted liposomes lose their specificity by macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in non-target tissue due to enhanced endogenous IgM corona on the surface of the liposomes [ 154 ]. Similarly, Xiao et al. in their findings, reported that transferrin-targeted nanoparticles reduced their ability to target transferrin receptors in vitro studies. Furthermore, they decided to investigate the impact of this protein corona against brain drug delivery. They found that the composition of protein corona was significantly altered after BBB transcytosis (that recapitulated the in vivo brain targeting) in theirBTB model. This in vitro and in vivo discrepancy in targeting specificity was probably due to the absorption of another protein like apolipoproteins (e.g., apolipoprotein A-I) on the surface of the transferrin-targeted nanoparticles, improving their permeability across the BBB. Collectively, these findings suggested the potential of protein corona in improving the targeting across the BBB and guiding the in vivo fate of the nanoparticle [ 155 ]. More interestingly, chimeric protein modification adopted by biomimetic/bioinspired drug delivery systems was reported to decrease the influence of biomolecular corona due to their surface occupancy.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

            "text": "Further, they correlated the relative teemingness of known proteins in the PC with the positive or negative impact of NPs on cellular uptake in cancer and stem cells to discriminate the key corona component. Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

The protein corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' blood circulation, clearance, biodistribution, biodegradation, and delivery efficiency. For instance, opsonin's enhances the phagocytosis and removal of nanoparticles from circulation, whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins can extend their circulation time. However, the protein corona can mask nanoparticle targeting groups, such as transferrin, reducing their delivery efficiency to tumours. Nanoparticles need to be small enough, typically less than 4 \u00b5m, for effective cellular uptake, with those under 100 nm being absorbed more efficiently through endocytosis. Drug carriers between 100-1000 nm have higher bioavailability once endocytosed, with nanoparticles around 50 nm showing the highest cellular uptake. 51 The surface charge of nanoparticles also plays a crucial role, as cationic and neutral particles exhibit higher transport efficiency due to electrostatic attraction than negatively charged particles. Uptake mechanisms include clathrinmediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and physical adhesion followed by penetration, while larger particles involve energy-dependent endocytosis. Additionally, physicochemical surface coatings, such as chitosan, can optimize paracellular transport for drug delivery.",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "The formation of the biomolecule corona on the surface of nanoparticles upon exposure to biological fluids critically influences nanocarrier performance in drug delivery. It has been shown that in some cases corona proteins can mediate specific nanoparticle interactions with cell receptors. Within this context, in order to identify corona proteins affecting nanoparticle uptake, in this work, correlation analysis is performed between the corona composition of a panel of silica nanoparticles of different sizes and surface functionalities and their uptake in four endothelial cell types derived from different organs. In this way, proteins that correlate with increased or decreased uptake were identified, and their effects were validated by studying the uptake of nanoparticles coated with a single protein corona and competition studies in brain and liver endothelium. The results showed that precoating nanoparticles with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) alone strongly decreased uptake in both liver and brain endothelium. Furthermore, our results suggested the involvement of the transferrin receptor in nanoparticle uptake in liver endothelium and redirection of the nanoparticles to other receptors with higher uptake efficiency when the transferrin receptor was blocked by free transferrin. These data suggested that changes in the cell microenvironment can also affect nanoparticle uptake and may lead to a different interaction site with nanoparticles, affecting their uptake efficiency. Overall, correlating the composition of the protein corona and nanoparticle uptake by cells allows for the identification of corona molecules that can be used to increase as well as to reduce nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (62,63). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (64), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (65) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (65). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (33) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density. Thus, it appears that ApoE exerted distinct functions on NPs with low and high PEG densities. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that apolipoproteins involved in the trafficking of lipids in the bloodstream also impact on the in vivo clearance of NPs. \n\nOnce inside the cell, it is presumed that the protein corona is removed in phagolysosomes, causing the true \"identity\" of the NPs to be revealed (66).",

            "text": "Early responses are likely to be the most discriminating. \n\nIt is known that in a biological environment nano-SiO 2 will associate with macromolecules (e.g. proteins and lipids) that coat the nanoparticles and form what has been termed a ''corona''. Such a coating influences the uptake, toxicity, cellular response and clearance rates of nano-SiO 2 particles [59,60]. Analysis of the corona of A549 cells incubated with culture medium by SDS-PAGE indicated preferential binding of three main serum proteins, and these were identified as albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and hemoglobin. Interaction of nano-SiO 2 with these proteins has been reported previously [11]. Additionally, proteomic analysis indicated the presence of fibronectin and vitronectin, which have also been reported to bind to silica [61,62]. It is possible that the presence of such proteins on the surface of the nanoparticles were responsible for the attenuation of cytotoxicity observed, although it is not possible from the present work to eliminate the effect of other non-proteinaceous components of serum. Apolipoproteins are lipid binding proteins with detergentlike amphipathic properties that behave as water-soluble carriers in lymph and blood. A coating of apolipoprotein A-I on the surface of nano-SiO 2 particles may impart amphipathic properties on the nanoparticles thus facilitating their transport through the lymphatic and circulatory systems and possible elimination. The presence of vitronectin and fibronectin in the corona is of interest as these proteins are involved in cell membrane stability, integrity, adhesion and wound healing and such proteins in the coating could affect the ability of nano-SiO 2 Cultures of A549 cells (n = 5) were treated for 4 h with 100 mg/ml or vehicle only (n = 5) in medium containing 1.25% serum. Total cell homogenates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, proteins extracted, digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-MS/MS.",

The in vivo fate of nanomedicine such as blood circulation, organ biodistribution, cellular interaction and intracellular transport is substantially affected by the adsorbed proteins. Researchers have been attempting to identify key plasma proteins and their crucial role in the regulation of liposomal in vivo performance. Recent studies clarified that opsonization by immunoglobulins accelerates the rapid recognition and clearance of liposomes by RES, and even causes further immune responses [ 26 ,27 ]. On the contrary, the adsorption of albumin and apolipoprotein could prolong their blood circulation and improve biocompatibility [28] . Understanding how liposomes interact with the biological milieu and how protein corona affects the interaction between liposomes and bacteria are crucial for the rational development of liposomal antibiotics for managing bacterial infection. Here, the effect of protein corona on the interactions between liposomes and bacteria was explored. Specific enriched protein mediated liposome-MRSA interaction was actively exploited here to enhance bacteria-targeted antibiotic delivery.",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

Apolipoproteins have critical role in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and adsorption of them on nanoparticle surface influences the nanoparticle biodistribution 41 . They also reported that apolipoproteins and complement proteins induce the uptake of nanoparticles by macrophages. However, according to our results obtained from in vivo study, we assume these proteins could improve the solubility of Ch based nanoparticles in serum pH, as they improve the solubility of lipid particles in blood. \n\nProtein C identified as autoprothrombin IIA and blood coagulation factor XIV is a proenzyme that following its activation regulates anticoagulation, inflammation, cell death, and maintains the permeability of blood vessels. Although the role of some histidine rich glycoprotein (HRG) in prohibiting phagocytosis of nanoparticles with HRG enriched protein corona by macrophages was previously demonstrated 51 , the effect of protein C, which is also a glycoprotein, has remained unclear. \n\nTo better discuss the result of the test, Fig. 3 indicates the classification of hard corona composition for the PECs based on isoelectric point (pI, A), Mw (B), and physiological function (C) of the proteins. \n\nMost of the interacted proteins, due to their high abundance in serum, have the pI between 5 to 6 and the negative charge in pH of the serum. In hard corona, the portion of proteins with neutral and positive charges considerably increased in compare with FBS contents which affirms the non-electrostatic (pI, 7-8) and electrostatic interaction (pI, 8-10) between negatively charge nanoparticles and positively charge proteins, as mentioned about interaction of hemoglobin subunits.",

Recently, Zhang et al. had found the PC could decrease the binding of LT7 or DT7 with TfR .

            "text": "LSNPs. To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles. These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo. We first compared the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showing liver (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 6:1) and lung (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 10:1)-targeting effect. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25).",

            "text": "In the last few decades, nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery platforms have improved the therapeutic index of many drugs. In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Upon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

            "text": "This increase in protein corona abundances could have a high influence on the NP behaviors when they are introduced in vivo, especially in terms of biodistribution and circulation time. This requires further investigation since, as discussed above that proteins such as albumin could help prolong the circulation time, while the high abundance of HDLs such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E could promote clearance through their opsonin-like properties. \n\nLastly, the uptake of the coronas in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was investigated. The results were compared between the uptake of preformed coronas and in situ coronas. By both treatments, corona@Rf-SPION showed the highest uptake activity, followed by corona@C-SPION and corona@B-SPION at almost every incubation time. The only difference was observed at the incubation time of 4 h, where by treating in situ, the uptake levels of all SPIONs were comparable, as opposed to the trend shown in preformed coronas. These different uptake patterns could be due to the delay in corona formation when the SPIONs were added in situ compared to the already formed coronas which were taken up faster. Therefore, this suggests the importance of corona proteins in facilitating the uptake of the SPIONs into the cells in a distinct manner between each type of SPION. \n\nFor other incubation times, Rf-SPIONs showed the highest uptake activity, regardless of the corona formation process. \u221242 Here, the results also showed that once the Rf-SPIONs interact with serum proteins, neither preformation nor in situ formation of the protein corona of Rf-SPIONs did affect the uptake efficiency of the particles. This is an interesting result as several works showed that formation of protein coronas could hinder the targeting efficiencies of NPs due to the coverage of the ligands, for example, in the transferrin-functionalized silica NPs. 43 hen comparing the uptake of each SPIONs (Figure 4A) with the protein abundance results (Figure 2B), the two factors tend to be correlated. The cellular uptake activity was found to be the highest in Rf-SPIONs, followed by C-and B-SPIONs, respectively, whose protein corona amounts followed the same trend.",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

            "text": "Nevertheless, each endothelium showed different uptake efficiency, with the brain endothelium showing the lowest nanoparticle uptake efficiency and liver and kidney endothelium showing the highest. These differences may reflect their different physiological functions, where the blood-brain barrier, in general, has a more selective uptake than liver sinusoids and kidney glomeruli. Similarly, after 5-h exposure (Figure 2 and Figure 3a,b) for the 100 nm carboxylated silica, cell fluorescence in the liver endothelium was higher than in the lung endothelium, while the opposite was observed for the 200 nm amino-modified silica, i.e., higher fluorescence in the lung endothelium. These differences in absolute uptake efficiency may relate to differences in the expression level and activity of the receptors and mechanisms that are responsible for the uptake of the corona-coated nanoparticles between different endothelial cell types. Exploiting such differences may enable novel targeting strategies. \n\nCorrelation between Protein Corona Composition and Nanoparticle Uptake. In order to identify corona proteins which affected nanoparticle uptake, we performed correlation analysis between cellular uptake levels after 5-h exposure (Figure 3a and 3b) and the corona composition of all 6 investigated silica nanoparticles using Pearson correlation (Figure 3c). A positive correlation (r \u2265 0.6), which indicates that a high amount of a certain protein in the corona correlated with higher uptake by cells, was observed in brain and lung endothelium for alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, immunoglobulins, human serum albumin (HSA), prothrombin, and transferrin. Interestingly, in the liver endothelium, a strong negative correlation (r \u2264 \u22120.6) was observed for some proteins including histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and no positive correlation. This lack of discrimination between proteins for uptake may be explained by the clearance function of scavenger endothelial cells of the liver. \n\nIn addition, we also performed correlation analysis based on nanoparticle uptake levels at 24 h (Table S1, Supporting Information).",

This biocorona is a dynamic and complex structure that determines how host cells respond to nanoparticles. Despite the common use of mouse models in pre-clinical and toxicological experiments, the impact of corona formed in mouse serum on the biophysical and biological properties of different size NP has not been thoroughly explored. Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

Albumin was a major component of both hard and soft coronas, although myriad other immunoglobulin, complement, and other unidentified proteins were involved in a dynamic remodeling process over 30 min. The overall goal of such efforts is to elucidate specific surface features of nanoparticles that might promote selective accumulation of desirable corona components during in vivo circulation. However, given the likely variability of serum protein, lipid, and immunoglobulin composition from patient to patient, selective post hoc tailoring of the corona presents challenges to achieving specificity for molecular targeting. \n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-coat nanoparticles with various components that can be specified in advance in an effort to improve selective compartmental trafficking [118,[121][122][123]. Dysopsonins such as albumin or various apolipoproteins can be preloaded onto nanoparticle surfaces prior to injection to establish a hard corona that enhances circulation times, reduces toxicity, and avoids RES clearance [124][125][126][127][128]. Hou et al., reported that PBN formed from p5RHH peptides and siRNA that were pretreated with albumin to form a hard corona enhanced transfection in vitro, while stabilizing PBN size and reducing charge to mildly negative (-5 to -7 mv) as suggested earlier by Xiao et al. [106] for enhanced extrahepatic delivery [51,52]. Subsequent studies in vivo with systemically administered p5RHH-RNA PBN confirmed avoidance of liver uptake and a shift to kidney clearance for the p5RHH system [66,114,129,130].",

            "text": "To further investigate the protein corona composition, proteins are typically separated and desorbed from purified protein-nanoparticle complexes. We utilized the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method by cutting protein gel bands and then performing protein sequencing using LC-MS/MS, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of PCs (Figure 3). The current mechanisms underlying how the protein corona affects cell metabolism are not yet clear. It is known that proteins in the corona on nanoparticles can interact with other biomolecules inside and outside the cells. The intracellular protein corona regulates the macrophage phenotype and induces stress responses in endothelial cells. We believe that intercellular proteins replace some proteins from the surface of nanoparticles, disrupting protein homeostasis, subsequently triggering the \"Neutrophil activation involved in immune response\", \"Respiratory vesicle lumen\", \"Cytoplasmic vesicle lumen\", and \"Secretory granule lumen\" pathways (Figure 4). The PC-induced neutrophils impact the cellular clearance pathways of nanoparticles and alter cell metabolism. Currently, the targeted delivery of nanomedicines still presents significant challenges. Research by Wilhelm et al. has shown that only 0.7% of nanomaterials can be effectively transported to specific target sites [25]. Ideally, drugs should be enriched in target organs while minimizing accumulation in other tissues. However, in most cases, the formation of the protein corona weakens the targeting ability of nanomaterials. This is because the PC covers the surface of the nanomaterial carrying ligands, creating a barrier between the ligands and target cells, impeding their mutual recognition and reducing targeting efficiency. Therefore, in the follow-up experiments, we will knock out or inhibit proteins such as F-actin, Coronin, vATPase, TUBA, TUBB, MHCII, and TSP to elucidate the impact of these protein coronas on the mechanism of cellular phagocytosis.",

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

After intravenous administration, nanoparticles face multiple obstacles, including opsonization, uptake by macrophages, nonspecific accumulation in organs like the spleen and liver, and challenges in margination dynamics.

Adapted from (171, 172). \n\nthe accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors, overcoming the limitations of the EPR effect. After discussing the role of PEGylation and alternative hydrophilic polymers in enhancing circulation time and reducing undesired uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), it is crucial to consider another pivotal factor influencing nanoparticle behavior in the bloodstream: the formation of a protein corona. Upon entering the biological milieu, nanoparticles rapidly associate with various proteins in the serum, forming what is referred to as the protein corona (69). This protein layer significantly influences the biodistribution, cellular uptake, and interactions of nanoparticles with target cells (70). For instance, the presence of a protein corona can either enhance or hinder the targeting of nanoparticles to specific cell populations (71). Understanding and controlling the formation of the protein corona is crucial for optimizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems, especially in precise mitochondrial targeting strategies. By finely tuning the surface characteristics and size of nanoparticles, the composition and structure of the protein corona can be manipulated, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing non-specific interactions (72,73). This is a pivotal step in advancing mitochondrial-targeted nanotherapeutics and their clinical applications, ensuring higher precision and reduced toxicity in treatments.",

            "text": "Another critical effect affecting biodistribution is protein corona, which coats particles with serum proteins [55]. Because of the nanoparticle coating, slight alterations in surface charges are expected, leading to further interactions between serum proteins in a cascade fashion and thus preventing the interaction between nanomedicines and their tumor targets [56]. However, it is essential to emphasize that the protein corona effect involves two classes of components affecting nanomedicines' biodistribution: opsonins and dysopsonins [57]. Opsonins, such as proteins of the complement system (C3b and C1q) and immunoglobulins, are the most common, and their adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles is responsible for their engulfment and clearance by the RES-associated phagocytic cells, more specifically in the liver and spleen [58][59][60][61][62][63]. Engrafting hydrophilic or amphiphilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), on the surface of the particles, is one strategy for reducing RES recognition [60,64,65]. Despite the popularity of this technique, issues related to PEG molecules' stability and immunogenicity have emerged in the last few years [66,67]. Recently, zwitterionic materials, such as sulfobetaine, have been used to confer stealth properties. Their mixed charges and electrostatic repulsion account for dense packing, thus impairing protein corona formation [68][69][70][71]. In contrast, dysopsonins, such as clusterin (apolipoprotein J) and albumin, have the opposite effect, prolonging nanomedicine's half-life in circulation [64,72]. For example, the glycoprotein CD47, which is expressed in all cellular membranes of humans, mice, and other mammals [73], interacts with CD172a on phagocytes [74] and inhibits macrophage uptake of antibody-coated mouse red blood cells (RBCs) [75].",

The fact that identical materials with different size and surface charge bind different proteins into their coronas has deep implications for regulation of nanomaterials, and suggests that in the future nanoparticles may be able to be classified according to the proteins that they bind, and potential impacts from nanoparticles may be predicted based on protein coronas. Interestingly, apolipoprotein A1 is the major component of HDL (high density lipoproteins), and is found on chylomicrons, large lipoprotein particles created by the absorptive cells of the small intestine, which are used in cholesterol transport in vivo [11,12]. This has potentially significant implications for the uptake and transport of nanoparticles, as, for example, apolipoprotein E has been shown to enhance transport to the brain [13]. More recent results from the NanoInteract project have shown that changing the size and / or surface charge of nanoparticles influences the proteins that bind to the nanoparticles in a biological media, including resulting in specific binding of Apolipoprotein E or Apolipoprotein F which is known to promote transport across the placenta, as shown in Table 1 [10].",

            "text": "Understanding protein-nanoparticle interaction, so-called nanoparticle-protein corona, is important for the interpretation of biokinetic behaviors, bioavailability, and toxicity potential. When an inorganic or organic material comes in contact with biological fluids, such as blood, rapid interactions occur instantly and lead to protein adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles. Therefore, the interaction of nanoparticles with proteins is highly dependent on the surface characteristics and particle size of the nanoparticles. 43,44 6][47] These types of interactions may cause undesirable toxic effects or facilitate the delivery of nanoparticles to organs, because plasma proteins play a critical role in the disposition, transportation, and deposition of both endogenous and exogenous molecules by noncovalent interaction. 48 In particular, nanoparticleprotein corona implicates cellular interaction in terms of toxicity, uptake, and immune response. For example, it was reported that albumin-adsorbed single-walled carbon nanotubes contributed to the induction of anti-inflammatory Notes: Serum protein adsorbed on (or bound to) the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) may facilitate immune recognition (uptake and elimination by immune cells) or cellular uptake. Protein conformational changes as a consequence of nanoparticle-protein interaction could cause undesirable toxicological effects or decrease biological activity. Uptake amount, uptake mechanism, and target-organ distribution of nanoparticles can also be influenced by nanoparticle-protein corona. \n\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

            "text": "For instances, protein C had more interaction with thiolated PEC, serotransferin mostly absorbed on the PEC with additional Ch content, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor interaction associated to the PEC structure which interacted with the PECs with D/Ch ratio of 5 rather than D/Ch ratio of 0.2. The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties. Although albumin has the most percentage in serum, we assume that the mentioned proteins have more affinity to the PEC functional groups. \n\nMoreover, the interaction of the specific proteins can affect the biodistribution, clearance, and uptake of the nanoparticles by macrophages and target cells 49,50 .",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

The relative protein abundance (RPA) of biologically relevant proteins such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, immunoglobulins, acute phase proteins, tissue leakage, and lipoproteins are displayed in Figure 3. Our findings confirmed that each liposome exhibits a specific protein pattern dictated by its specific lipid composition. Over the last decade, numerous studies have tried to relate the cellular uptake of nanoparticle-protein complexes to PC composition by an oversimplified picture of particle-cell interaction; the more abundant a corona protein, the more probable the molecular recognition by cell receptors and, in turn, the more significant its role in promoting nanoparticle-cell association. However, to understand the link between a nanoparticle-corona complex and specific uptake pathways, mapping the exact location of protein binding sites is a necessary step [41,42].",

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "On its journey through the bloodstream, individual PTs will interact with a wide range of factors, leading to the formation of an adsorbed protein layer known as the protein corona [46,47] and opsonization, which can lead to enhanced PT clearance from the bloodstream, altered targeting (both inhibition and promotion) and the induction of toxicity [47]. Coronal factors include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), transferrin, fibrinogen and apolipoproteins, while antibodies, complement proteins and circulating proteins such as pentraxins, collectins and ficolins can all act as opsonizing agents. For a wider aspect on the importance of the protein corona to nanomedicine, we direct the reader to a recent excellent review [48]. \n\nThe formation of the protein corona not only depends on the type of polymer used [49,50] but also the specific physiological environments encountered [51], the duration of exposure [52,53] and also on the state of the patient being treated [54]. The latter study demonstrated that while protein corona formation on various nanomedicines displayed similarities between control and breast cancer patients, blood cancer patients and smokers demonstrated differing protein corona patterns in comparison to healthy controls [54]. Furthermore, genetic background, sex, life-style and race also strongly influence plasma protein levels in healthy individuals [55,56], which all contribute to patient-specific corona formation. \n\nAs mentioned, the formation of the protein corona on PT formulations can significantly affect PT targeting and, therefore overall efficiency. Meister et al. discovered that polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles containing the A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen (as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD)) became quickly decorated with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which actually aided the passage of the nanoparticle through the blood-brain-barrier [57]. Furthermore, a study by Papi et al. discovered that protein corona formation also increased cellular uptake of PEGylated liposomal irinotecan in the pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma cell line (PANC-1) [58].",

During in-depth exploration of the relationship fate between protein corona and NPs in vivo, the influence of protein corona on mRNA NP targeting was found to have two sides. The adsorption process of protein coronas is known to be difficult to control, and protein coronas can even mask the targeting ligands, leading to loss of targeting efficacy. Based on these results, the protein corona is considered an \"enemy\" in NPs targeting strategies, necessitating resistance to protein corona adsorption in vivo. However, emerging evidence shows that some specific protein coronas in the blood can improve mRNA NP delivery to specific tissues [91]. For example, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with liver-specific delivery of NPs. If these protein coronas with specific targeting properties can be reasonably utilized, the targeting strategies of mRNA NPs can be greatly optimized.",

However, incubation of NF55-SCO nanoparticles in murine serum for 60 min resulted in a significantly higher amount of C3 proteins in the corona compared to SCO alone. That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88]. In case of murine plasma, however, no significant differences were observed between any nanoparticles tested and the amount of C3 proteins adsorbed to nanoparticles was rather equal (Figure 4c  or SCO alone were bound to streptavidin on superparamagnetic beads or beads were left untreated (control) before incubation with murine serum (a,b) or murine plasma (c,d) for 5 or 60 min at room temperature. After pull-down, bound C3 and its fragments were quantified by Western blot.

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

            "text": "addition of fetuin into culture medium increased cellular uptake of PF14-SCO nanoparticles and splicing correction by SCO in HeLa pLuc705 cells in SR-dependent manner [52]. Interestingly, in case of human serum, PF14-pDNA nanoparticles demonstrated higher adsorption of most proteins compared to pDNA alone (Table 5), further emphasizing marked differences in composition of protein corona between sera of various mammals. In addition to fetuin, which marks nanoparticles for recognition by macrophages via scavenger receptors, also \u03b1-2-macroglobulin that is abundant in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) might dampen the effect of injected pharmaceuticals, like oligonucleotides, targeting these to elimination as found earlier [77].\n\nTo sum up, serum albumin was a prominent constituent in protein corona forming around CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in all studied sera: from calf, mouse and human, although from mouse serum it did not associate to nanoparticles with the highest yield. However, the protein composition varied extensively between different sera and each protein corona showed individual pattern.\n\nIn addition, the functioning of proteins forming corona around PF14-pDNA nanoparticles in murine serum is in good concordance with the recent reports about the behaviour and targeting [78] of these nanoparticles in vivo. Accordingly, high level of alpha 1antitrypsin in protein corona of PF14-pDNA nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) correlates well with accumulation of nanoparticles in lungs of mice [79]. It was also shown that accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100, [80] and complement component 3 [78] in protein corona targets nanoparticles to liver. In both these organs high expression of luciferase from pGL3 plasmid was observed recently, whereas only low amounts of these nanoparticles were targeted to spleen, kidney, and heart [55,81].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is \u201cread\u201d by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.",

            "text": "Nonspecific association of serum molecules with short-interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles can change their physiochemical characteristics, and results in reduced cellular uptake in the target tissue during the systemic siRNA delivery process. Serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the body and has been used to modify the surface of nanoparticles, to inhibit association of other serum molecules. Here, we hypothesized that surface modification of lipid-based nanoparticular siRNA delivery systems with albumin could prevent their interaction with serum proteins, and improve intracellular uptake. In this study, we investigated the influence of albumin on the stability and intracellular siRNA delivery of the targeted siRNA nanoparticles of a polymerizable and pH-sensitive multifunctional surfactant N-(1-aminoethyl) iminobis[N-(oleoylcysteinylhistinyl-1-aminoethyl)propionamide] (EHCO) in serum. Serum resulted in a significant increase in the size of targeted EHCO/siRNA nanoparticles and inhibited cellular uptake of the nanoparticles. Coating of targeted EHCO/siRNA nanoparticles with bovine serum albumin at 9.4 \u03bcM prior to cell transfection improved cellular uptake and gene silencing efficacy of EHCO/siRNA targeted nanoparticles in serum-containing media, as compared with the uncoated nanoparticles. At a proper concentration, albumin has the potential to minimize interactions of serum proteins with siRNA nanoparticles for effective systemic in vivo siRNA delivery.",

            "text": "interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal of excess free proteins. The lower uptake could be related to specific differences in corona composition. For instance, a study on macrophages suggested that the presence of histidinerich glycoprotein in the corona is associated with a decreased uptake. 68 Here, similarly, the observed higher abundance of this protein in the corona formed at higher serum content could be one of the factors contributing to their lower uptake. Further studies are necessary to fully demonstrate similar effects connected to the relative abundance of individual proteins in the corona.\n\nNext to this, the results suggest that multiple uptake mechanisms seem involved at the same time in the uptake of nanoparticles. It has been previously hypothesized that, within a sample, multiple subpopulations of different coronas may be formed, 7 and this could explain\ue0d5at least in part\ue0d5the observed co-presence of different uptake mechanisms. More subtle changes of corona composition over time and during exposure to cells could also explain this observation. Further studies are required to fully characterize the molecular details of the mechanisms involved in each case, possibly combining the use of transport inhibitors and RNA interference with other methods, such as the use of genetically modified cells.\n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the importance of defining what the \"correct corona\" is for each nanomedicine (or nanoparticle) when investigating its behavior on cells. For instance, for nanomedicines administered by injection, not only higher serum content but also other factors likely to affect corona composition should be considered, such as the presence of blood flow and the more complex composition of plasma in vivo (as opposed to the serum used here). 13,36 Similar considerations should also be applied to nanomedicines administered via different routes, for instance inhaled or ingested nanomedicines, for which a serum corona may be not relevant. Additionally, other more complex factors such as the evolution of corona composition over time and changes due to the interaction with secreted cellular biomolecules may also affect the uptake mechanisms",

The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane.

            "text": "Additional serum proteins in the medium that generated the biomolecular corona around the surface further led to a slightly lower uptake (orange bars). Thus, the associated corona proteins may have masked the attached ApoA1 or exerted an inhibition effect on cellular uptake and thus outcompeted with the targeting group. However, the differences observed with and without FBS were slight, especially at the lower concentration. The effect of the corona was more pronounced at the higher concentration, however, the uptake was still significantly higher compared to pristine liposomes. Thus, ApoA1 remains biologically active despite the presence of the biomolecular corona. For the Lipo-DBCO:ApoA1 ratio of 500:1 at 75 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in medium containing serum proteins, a non-concentration dependent uptake behavior was observed (75 \u03bcg mL \u22121 vs 150 \u03bcg mL \u22121 , orange bars). The reason for this is not clear, although it might be related to the fact that this was the sample with lowest ApoA1 coverage. In this case, the corona formed in FBS may have been more influential compared to the low ApoA1 density. Interestingly, in all other cases, cell uptake was not influenced by the azidation degree or the protein amount. This suggests that the optimal coupling conditions should incorporate the lowest azidation degree possible to limit its influence on structure, yet high enough to maintain sufficient surface coverage of targeting groups. \n\nTaken together, the results indicate that the native structure of ApoA1 was retained during functionalization and, thus, a cellular response could be achieved. Indeed, the structure of ApoA1 has been shown to affect the cholesterol removal of nascent discoidal HDL particles by RAW cells. [24] This underlines the importance of maintaining the structural integrity and associated effects of not only ApoA1 but other potential targeting proteins. However, it is important to mention that for final targeting applications in specific tissues/cell types, receptor recognition needs to be validated, e.g. by receptor-blocking experiments. Overall, our presented functionalization strategy is suitable for conjugation of various different protein types with precise characterization of each reaction step and the possibility to adjust for the optimal functionalization degrees before diving into biological testing.",

            "text": "Traditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system. But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

No major differences between the three molecular weight PEG groups with either the CD11c targeting or the isotype control antibody could be detected. All of the individual groups exhibited serum albumin, which had been highly adsorbed onto the nanocarrier's surface. Likewise, the qualitative SDS-PAGE detection of desorbed corona proteins showed serum albumin as the most abundant protein as visualized by silver staining (Figure S5B). Moreover, by depicting the top six corona proteins we further highlighted that serum albumin has the highest abundance of all identified proteins (Figure 6B). As seen before with PEGylation, the analysis of the murine biomolecular corona showed that the surfacemodification of the nanocarriers with PEG, or in combination with antibodies only, slightly influenced the protein adsorption profile. In general, only a low number of proteins adsorbed onto the nanocarrier's surface with very little influence on the stealth targeting ability. \n\nWhile conducting the uptake studies using the DC2.4 cell line, we also analyzed the influence of the PEG linker length on the uptake of anti-CD11c-functionalized nanocarriers in primary DCs, such as BMDCs and cDC1s of the spleen (Figure 7A-E). In contrast to the uptake studies in DC2.4 cells, the targeting ability of anti-CD11c-functionalized nanocarriers was reduced when incubated with BMDCs (Figure 7A). This was even more pronounced for incubation in the presence of FBS. However, the targeting ability, in terms of the anti-CD11c/isotype control ratio, was significantly increased for the longer PEG-DBCO linkers 2 kDa and 5 kDa by 4.0-fold and 4.75-fold, respectively, compared to 0.65 kDa PEG-DBCO (1.55-fold) (Figure 7B).",

[13][14][15] The corona is a very selective layer of proteins and other biomolecules, which strongly adsorbs on the nanoparticle surface for time scales longer than nanoparticle uptake in cells, thus constitutes the new complex unit interacting with the cellular machinery. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] The formation of a corona affects the material properties also by simply lowering the surface free energy of the bare material.\n\nHere we show that for identical particles and cells, otherwise under identical conditions, the interactions with cells and the biological outcomes can vary greatly in the presence or in the absence of a pre-formed corona in serum. Several examples can be found, for different nanoparticles and cell systems, where uptake levels vary when particles are exposed to cells in serum free medium or in the presence of a protein coating. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] In particular, even though the details of the uptake mechanisms are still unresolved (indeed, details are still missing even for nanoparticles exposed to cells in presence of serum), [30][31] it has been observed that nanoparticle uptake in serum free conditions is, in most cases, higher than what measured for the same nanoparticle in the presence of serum, [23][24][25][26][27] or also a more simple protein solution (such as for instance what observed for FePt nanoparticles in the presence of albumin or transferrin). 29 Moreover, different reports have shown that nanoparticle impact is also affected by the presence or absence of a protein coating (or other coatings) on their surface, and that the presence of a corona in serum can mitigate the toxicity of the bare materials. [32][33][34][35][36] In order to further explain and to connect these different outcomes, we have studied how uptake and impact of silica nanoparticles in A549 lung epithelial cells are affected by the presence or the absence of a pre-formed corona in serum.

The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases.

            "text": "This protein layer significantly influences the biological behavior of nanocarriers by altering their physicochemical properties and can ultimately control their in vivo fate. This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona [38]. Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics [39]. On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake [39]. In summary, an in-depth understanding of protein corona and its complex interactions with NPs is essential in designing effective nanocarrier systems for therapeutic delivery. \n\nAfter discussing cellular targeting, another significant component of active targeting, known as transcytosis nanomedicine, warrants our attention [40]. In contrast to the classical active targeting mechanism, which predominantly involves the binding of nanomedicine to cell surface receptors, transcytosis nanomedicine takes a step further. It is designed to be transported across cells, exploiting cellular machinery to transport nanomedicine from one side of the cell to the other. This process is beneficial in crossing biological barriers that are otherwise hard to penetrate, such as the blood-brain barrier or that of specific dense tumoral tissues. The application of transcytosis nanomedicine becomes especially significant in cancer therapy, where the tumor microenvironment (TME) often presents a formidable challenge to conventional drug delivery methods. By utilizing transcytosis nanomedicine, we can enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues, improving the efficacy of the treatment while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

            "text": "While the above approaches allow to more accurately identify which corona components play a role in nanoparticle uptake, the next important aspect to unravel is which cell receptors are involved (Figure 2C). Thus, following the identification of all possible interacting receptors based on corona composition and/or epitope mapping, it is important to verify which of them can actually recognize and bind to the corona and if such recognition and the interaction with those receptors also lead to nanoparticle internalization. For instance, Caracciolo et al. (2013) showed that abundant adsorption of vitronectin from human plasma on lipid nanoparticles promoted nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells overexpressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the uptake. Epitope mapping can also be used to predict the involvement of certain receptors. In the study by Lara et al. (2017) discussed above, epitope mapping showed exposure of apolipoprotein B-100 and the Fc region of IgG in the biomolecular corona of 100 nm silica (Figures 4A,B). Then, the authors also showed that in cells overexpressing their receptors, i.e., the LDL receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively, nanoparticle uptake was enhanced (see Figures 4C,D for LDL receptor), while adding LDL reduced it (Figure 4E). These results suggested that nanoparticle uptake was mediated by recognition of the biomolecular corona by these specific receptors. These studies also showed that the biomolecular corona can be recognized by multiple receptors in the same cells. Interactions with multiple receptors may lead to uptake via multiple pathways. In line with this, Francia et al. (2019) showed that 50 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles coated with a different corona (in low or high amounts of human serum) interacted with different receptors and consecutively were internalized by cells using different pathways. Thus, the interaction of the corona with specific cell receptors can also affect the mechanisms cells use for nanoparticle internalization. \n\nGiven the wide variety of proteins constituting the biomolecular corona, it has also emerged that more complex motifs can be formed in this layer.",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to improve the properties of targeted nanoparticles in vivo. 24 Various studies have investigated the effect of corona formation on nanoparticle targeting. 25 It was found that nanoparticles can recruit specific proteins from plasma, which eventually promote interactions with targeted cells. 26 Adsorption of apolipoproteins to polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles was shown to enhance the transport of nanoparticles across the blood brain barrier. 27 dditionally, Caracciolo et al. saw that the adsorption of vitronectin can enhance cellular interactions with cancer cells. 28 urther, we already showed that due to a pre-formed protein corona nanoparticle aggregation in blood plasma is prevented. 29 ext to this, other studies demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was strongly reduced if nanoparticles were precoated with cell culture medium containing FBS. 30,31 This highlights the great potential to exploit corona formation. \n\nTo take this one-step forward, we aimed to create a preformed protein corona, which enables controlled cellular inter-actions. Here, it was intended to engineer nanoparticles with stealth properties mediated only through corona proteins. Immunoglobulins (IgG) are one major class of proteins ('opsonins'), which are known to enhance cellular uptake by macrophages via interactions with the Fc receptor. 32 Therefore, we removed IgG from human plasma via affinity chromatography. This protein fraction ('IgG depleted plasma') was chosen as a protein coating in order to create a pre-formed protein corona,  which should prevent interactions with macrophages. To explore the stealth properties of the pre-formed protein, we analyzed the cellular interactions of uncoated and pre-coated nanoparticles with a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). Next, the major aspect of our work focused on the question, whether the pre-adsorbed corona proteins are exchanged or covered by other proteins over time, when pre-coated nanoparticles are reexposed to human plasma. This question needs to be addressed in order to reveal if nanoparticle pre-coating is an effective strategy to enable controlled cellular interactions in vivo.",

            "text": "In addition, we also performed correlation analysis based on nanoparticle uptake levels at 24 h (Table S1, Supporting Information). Given that the uptake behavior, especially for the 100 nm nanoparticles, was different after 24 h, this expectedly led to different results in the correlation analysis. In this case, all endothelial cell types showed a similar profile of positively correlated proteins, and no negative correlation was observed for any of the proteins in all endothelial cell types, including for the liver. Many proteins in liver and kidney endothelium, including albumin and transferrin, which showed minimal correlation based on the 5-h uptake, now turned out to be positively correlated. These differences may reflect observed differences in nanoparticle distribution in vivo over time, when nanoparticles first may accumulate in certain organs and then are released again and accumulate in other organs at later times. Further studies are required to explain this observation and to determine, depending on the application, the most appropriate exposure time to use for similar correlation analysis. \u221247 Role of the Correlated Corona Proteins in Nanoparticle Uptake. In order to verify if the high abundant proteins in the corona that correlate with higher cellular uptake do have a role in nanoparticle uptake by the endothelial cells, i.e., to exclude coincidence, we performed validation experiments using artificial single protein-coronas (Figure 4) and competition studies (Figure S9, Supporting Information). For practical reasons, this validation study was performed using the 200 nm SiO 2 \u2212NH 2 since they showed higher uptake in all cell lines, thus making it easier to observe a possible inhibition in uptake. For similar reasons, validation was performed in brain and liver endothelium to compare the effects of the identified proteins in cells that showed the lowest and highest uptake, respectively. Thus, in order to verify whether individual corona proteins identified by the correlation analysis did affect nanoparticle uptake, we prepared artificial corona made of the single correlated proteins. These were made by simply exposing the nanoparticles to a solution of the protein of interest at an excess concentration, in order to ensure that enough protein to cover all available nanoparticle surface was present.",

Moreover, by depicting the top six corona proteins we further highlighted that serum albumin has the highest abundance of all identified proteins (Figure 6B). As seen before with PEGylation, the analysis of the murine biomolecular corona showed that the surface-modification of the nanocarriers with PEG, or in combination with antibodies only, slightly influenced the protein adsorption profile. In general, only a low number of proteins adsorbed onto the nanocarrier's surface with very little influence on the stealth targeting ability. Values are given as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 2). DC2.4 cells were incubated with nanocarriers (75 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) functionalized with antibodies and PEG linkers of varying lengths (0.65 kDa, 2 kDa, 5 kDa) for 2 h in culture medium without FBS, with 5% FBS, or pre-incubated with mouse plasma, and the uptake was quantified by analyzing the MFI (C). Values are given as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). For each cell culture medium condition, the MFI values obtained by analyzing anti-CD11c-functionalized nanocarriers were normalized to their isotype controls and different PEG linker lengths were compared (without FBS (D), with FBS (E), pre-incubated in mouse plasma (F)).

When nanocarriers come into contact with serum, proteins immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a protein corona which defines their biological identity. Although the composition of the protein corona has been widely determined by proteomics, its morphology still remains unclear. In this study we show for the first time the morphology of the protein corona using transmission electron microscopy. We are able to demonstrate that the protein corona is not, as commonly supposed, a dense, layered shell coating the nanoparticle, but an undefined, loose network of proteins. Additionally, we are now able to visualize and discriminate between the soft and hard corona using centrifugation-based separation techniques together with proteomic characterization. The protein composition of the \u223c15 nm hard corona strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the respective nanomaterial, thus further affecting cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Large diameter protein corona resulting from pre-incubation with soft corona or Apo-A1 inhibits cellular uptake, confirming the stealth-effect mechanism. In summary, the knowledge on protein corona formation, composition and morphology is essential to design therapeutic effective nanoparticle systems.",

Over the time, this corona evolves and may modulate nanoparticle-induced processes such as opsonization which have direct consequences on the mode of interaction with cells, the efficacy of cellular NP uptake and thus, the organ targeting, biodistribution, and circulatio time of NP in vertebrates and non-vertebrates [22]. \n\nOur study indicates that the properties of the NP dictate the extent and specificity of protein binding profiles, which are complex, and in line with other studies may well consist of more than hundred different proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Albeit we did not perform a detailed identification of the protein corona composition by comprehensive proteomic methods, previous studies demonstrated that the coronae indeed contain (patho)biologically relevant proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Such proteins are not only involved in essential processes of the blood system and, thus, may act as opsonins or dysopsonins and modulate blood coagulation, but are also implicated in (cytoprotective) signal transduction pathways [22,28,29,46]. Facing the complexity of the plasma corona, one main challenge is clearly to determine to what extent the nanobiological effects observed are mediated directly by the biological activity of corona proteins, and to dissect the involved molecular mechanism. Additionally, the impact of the formation of a corona on transforming the primary properties of the formulated nanomaterials needs to be investigated. Notably, further studies need to consider also the impact of GI fluids or mucus on the biotransformation of ingested nanomaterials. Albeit these investigations will be challenging, the results of such studies are required to complete out understanding of the fate of nanomaterials in physiologically relevant environments. \n\nIn conclusion, based also on our study it is conceivable to speculate that depending on the type of nanomaterials the presence of proteins will have dual effects: For one, proteins may trigger the formation of a biologically active protein corona.",

            "text": "Secondly, some inherent attributes of nanoparticles, for instance, high cation density and surface activity or leakage of toxic metal ions, are all issues requiring careful consideration.Thirdly, controllable industrial production of nanoparticles also constitutes a major factor that restricts their successful clinical translation; in particular the polydispersity of nanoparticles is crucial to the quality and clinical efficacy of the final products [178].\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that, subsequent to entering systemic circulation, nanoparticles will adsorb serum proteins and opsonins onto their surface, forming a dynamic nanoparticle-protein complex, also known as the protein corona, which impacts numerous physicochemical attributes of the nanoparticles, including their size, surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and aggregation state, accordingly determining their biological fate in vivo, which includes cellular uptake, intracellular transport, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution as well as toxicity [179].Additionally, the protein corona is likely to mask targeting ligands, causing off-target effects.When target cells interact with surface-functionalized nanoparticles in vivo, they identify and process the protein-complexed nanoparticles instead of the naked ones; therefore, the targeting efficiency, in addition to clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system, immunogenicity, as well as therapeutic effects of the nanoparticles, are primarily independent of their composition and surface functionalization, but dependent rather on the attributes, alignment, and residence time of adsorbed proteins on the surface of the nanoparticles.Taking into consideration the fact that protein corona formation of nanomaterials in vivo is unavoidable, this phenomenon is expected to be employed as a positive means for targeted drug delivery by designing synthetic nanoparticles that capture plasma proteins that are particularly identified by the receptors of target cells.This targeting strategy, developed on the basis of the protein corona effect, requires identification of a composition of adsorbed plasma proteins having the highest affinity to nanoparticles with various compositions and surface attributes.",

            "title": "Disentangling Biomolecular Corona Interactions With Cell Receptors and Implications for Targeting of Nanomedicines",
            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles adsorb a wide range of proteins when enter the biological environment 13 . The formed protein corona provides the nanoparticles with a \"biological identity\" that affects the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, cellular association, and targeting ability in vivo. In this study, we investigated how the drug-loaded PEG-PLA nanoparticles cross the blood-brain barrier and access microglia, and found that the composition of protein corona on PEG-PLA nanoparticles varied under different drug loading and dosing frequency. These changes of protein corona subsequently affected the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in b.End3 and BV-2 cells with the association of specific adsorbed components, and thereby influenced the brain delivery property and microgliatargeted internalization of nanoparticles in vivo. \n\nMicroglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). They are critical regulators to maintain homeostasis of the CNS 52 . However, microglia may themselves initiate neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration through loss of homeostatic and/or gain of aberrant function, revealing their potential as therapeutic targets 53 . Unfortunately, drug compounds cannot easily access to microglia due to the obstacle of BBB. It is likely to be important to develop highly-efficient nanoparticulate delivery system that can cross BBB and specifically target microglia. \n\nRecently, several studies have been conducted to develop promising nanoparticles by modulating the composition of formed corona in blood circulation. Guan et al. 54 modified ligand D8 on liposomes to improve immunocompatibility by attenuating natural IgM absorption. Zhang et al. 55 developed SP-sLip to achieve brain-targeted delivery by adsorbing plasma apolipoproteins E, A1 and J on the surface of nanocarriers. Controlling the corona composition on the surface of nanoparticles could offer exciting possibilities in specific drug delivery. Therefore, a better understanding of the uptake mechanisms of nanoparticles might help engineer more efficacious systems. \n\nOur results indicated that the composition of protein corona formed on PEG-PLA nanoparticles varied under different loading and multiple dosing condition.",

            "text": "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

            "text": "The knowledge gap in the interplay between liposomes and the physiological environment, for example, the blood and interstitial fluids, is probably one of the major reasons responsible for the limited clinical use of liposome-based therapeutics. Most of the commercially available liposomal products are administered systemically. Once administered, liposomes are immediately surrounded by various plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, immunoglobin, apolipoprotein, and fibrinogen), forming the socalled \"protein coronas\" as shown in Figure 1. [12,13] The protein coronas usually consist of two layers, the inner layer (hard corona) formed by proteins tightly bound to the liposome and the outer layer (soft corona) composed of loosely bound proteins. The boundary between the two layers is blurred and the corona is always in a thermodynamic equilibrium during blood circulation. \n\nThere are dozens of plasma proteins with varying identities and quantities, and the composition of protein coronas can be greatly influenced by the complexity of the physiological environment. As a result, the impact of protein adsorption on liposomes can be multifold. It might mask the pre-set chemical or biological functions of liposomes and govern the in vivo fate, including circulation lifetime, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and targeting ability. Even though the liposomes are surface-modified for certain chemical or biological functions, they can be easily masked by the corona. Moreover, the hydration layer around the liposomes is displaced upon protein binding, and the resulting protein aggregation and conformational changes may trigger immune responses in hosts. [11,14]",

            "text": "In another study, similar approaches were used to identify liposomal formulations with a corona fingerprint that allowed increased uptake in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Palchetti et al., 2019). Similarly, Liu et al. (2015) showed that by using a combination of linear and non-linear QSARs to analyze cell association of more than 80 gold nanoparticle formulations, some proteins, such as apoliproptotein B-100, \u03b1-1 antitrypsin, and plasminogen, were found to be significant protein corona fingerprints correlating with high nanoparticle-cell association. A combination of linear and non-linear QSAR has also been used to correlate the protein corona of 17 different liposomal formulations to the cellular uptake and cell viability of PC3 and HeLa cells (Bigdeli et al., 2016). For each formulation, a total of 12 different biological endpoints were measured and QSAR analysis was used to correlate the biological responses with both the liposome physicochemical properties and the protein corona fingerprints. The use of multiple cellular responses showed that different descriptors seem to be involved into different biological processes. Along these lines, a more complex correlation analysis involving three variables was also applied as another means of predicting nanoparticle-cell association (Yin et al., 2019): by adding the inflammatory response as another variable next to biomolecular corona composition and cellular uptake, Yin et al. (2019) revealed a strong statistical correlation between the fractions of certain proteins bound to nanoparticles, the association after inhalation of these nanoparticles to immune cells in the lungs, and the total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar correlation analysis between corona composition and cellular uptake was performed by Ritz et al. (2015). By correlating the corona composition of six different polystyrene nanoparticles with their cellular uptake, the authors could discover that apolipoprotein H significantly increased nanoparticle uptake when adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface, while apolipoprotein A4 and C3 significantly decreased uptake.",

            "text": "However, surveys of NPs in vivo demonstrate that mature protein coronas are predominantly constituted of apolipoproteins [23,24] which are recognized by multiple cell surface receptors and allow entry into many cells. For example, coronas with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have increased access to the brain [24]. Solid lipid NPs with surface coatings of polyethylene oxide (PEO) monomer chains and coronas of ApoE coronas crossed the blood brain barrier at rates that increased with increasing ApoE [29]. In addition, enhanced binding of ApoE to the surfaces of NPs with other surface compositions, including drugs, facilitates transport across the barrier into the brain [14]. Thus, protein binding is an important determinant of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for NPs [14]. \n\nIn recent in vitro studies, the critical role of serum concentration as a primary modulator of toxicity to NPs has been documented. High serum protein concentrations allow for protein attachment to hard coronas, which shields cells from immediate damage after engulfment of NPs [30,31]. In vivo serum concentrations are 10 to 50-fold higher than those used in cell culture (2%-10%, approximately 4 mg/mL) [30]. Thus, NP targeting of cells in culture is not necessarily reproducible in vivo [32]. In one example, the cytotoxic effects of NPs on A549 (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial) cells decreased with increasing concentrations of serum, from 4 to 40 mg/mL. Cytoxicity was evaluated based on cell death and decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels. The highest concentrations of serum fully protected A549 cells from NP toxicity [32]. The same investigators in related studies with lower concentrations of serum determined that NPs induce damage in a variety of different cell types via apparently similar mechanisms [30][31][32][33]. Endocytosis of NPs leads to degradation of the hard corona and exposure of NP-ligand surfaces in the lysosome.",

            "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "As shown in Figure 3(C), the internalization of Cy5.5-labeled LDL on the two types of cells was not significantly influenced by excess free T7, where very similar fluorescence intensities were exhibited (Figure 3(A)). \n\nOn the contrary, the binding of Cy5.5-labeled T7-LDL was significantly inhibited by pre-incubation with excess free T7 and the intracellular fluorescence declined to a level similar to that of Cy5.5-labeled LDL. The results demonstrated that when the expression level of TfR on the cell surface was lower, Cy5.5-labeled T7-LDL could not efficiently recognize and bind with the target cell via the T7 motif, and thus, the uptake efficiency of Cy5.5-labeled T7-LDL was suppressed significantly, becoming almost equivalent to that of Cy5.5labeled LDL. Following pre-incubation with excess free T7 and parent LDL (Figure 3(D)), a significantly decreased intracellular fluorescence was detected in the two types of cells treated with two formulations, suggesting the deactivation of TfR and LDLR. Taken together, these results indicated that the cellular uptake of T7-LDL was enhanced due to the synergism between TfR and LDLR mediations. Plasma or serum proteins were reported to associate to nanoparticles and form a new surface named the 'protein corona' (PC). Formed PCs can influence the biodistribution, targeting efficacy, and toxicity features of nanoparticles. Recently, a study demonstrated the PC could decrease the binding of T7 with TfR (Zhang et al., 2018). As the influence of serum on the prepared nanoparticles here was not evaluated, the above binding results may not fully and correctly reflect the in vivo situations. Therefore, in vivo approaches are strongly needed to assess the targeting ability of the designed nanocarriers in this article.",

            "text": "As has been reported, the nanoparticles are inevitably decorated with biological macromolecules when they are dispersed in the physiological media (for instance, human serum) and subsequently developing the socalled \"protein corona\". 74 The biological decoration of the nanoparticles renders their bio-chemical-physical properties, ultimately altering the functionalities and behaviors in cell targeting, systemic circulation, fibrillation, cellular uptake, and biocompatibility. The protein coronas structurally and morphologically transform nanoparticles beyond recognition as compared to the original as-synthesized counterpart. Consequently, the effects of bio-decoration on a variety of nanoparticle properties have been extensively studied in many biomedical applications, such as bio-detection, nano-therapeutics, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. 75\u00c079 For cancer cell targeting, the protein corona on the surface of nanoprobes poses a dual-effects (Figure 2B). However, the level of corona influence during CTC isolation can be adjusted by modifying the physiochemical properties of the nanoprobes. Professor Caruso's group at the University of Melbourne demonstrated the impact of serum proteins on the targeting efficacy of the antibody-grafted inorganic microspheres. 80 It was found that in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA) alone, protein coronas exhibited a favorable effect onligand-receptor interaction, while in the condition of many types of serum proteins, the targeting ability was eliminated due to alteration of the nanoprobe surface properties. In contrary, in the case of small molecular weight targeting ligands like transferrin or nanobody, the negative influence of the protein corona on the targeting ability is amplified to some degree (Figure 2B). 81,82 ince most of the serum protein molecules display a negative potential, they tend to bind onto the positivelycharged nanoparticles by forming a protein corona. This is a critical issue in charge-based CTC detection and isolation as the protein corona can significantly alter the overall nanoprobe charge conditions. We investigated the effects of hard and soft protein corona formed on the positively-charged (MNCs\u00c8) and the negatively-charged magnetic (MNCs\u00c9) nanoprobes in the PBS solution with different FBS concentrations and its influence on the capture efficiency of HeLa cells. 68",

            "text": "So far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal",

            "text": "TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

            "text": "mour-targeted delivery, either through passive targeting based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, active targeting or stimuli-responsive drug release, has been considered a key advantage of nanomedicines in cancer treatment 2 . However, compared with conventional drug formulations, the in vivo behaviour and fate of multifunctional nanostructures are more complex, which can make them particularly prone to inconsistencies across patients and between preclinical models and clinical applications 19 .\n\nThe properties of nanostructures are instantly affected when entering the body by interactions at the nano-bio interface. These interactions can lead to instabilities, such as particle aggregation, decomposition, loss of functional units or release of hazardous species, which greatly affect delivery efficiency and biosafety 20 . Contact with physiological fluids also leads to cloaking of the nanostructure with serum proteins (the protein corona), potentially shielding surface functionalities (such as targeting ligands) and interfering with drug release 21 . Antifouling modifications, such as coating with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), are often applied to reduce nanoparticle-protein interactions. Alternatives based on biomolecules, especially proteins and peptides, have also been reported 22,23 . In addition, interference of the protein corona with surface functionalities depends on the functionalization technique; for example, antibodies pre-adsorbed onto polymeric nanoparticles retain their targeting ability better than chemically conjugated molecules, perhaps owing to more robust surface coverage 24 . By tailoring nanosurface modifications, the protein corona composition can be manipulated and exploited to increase circulation, reduce toxicity or improve targeting 21,25 . For example, Onpattro, a commercially available small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation, recruits the liver-targeting protein, apolipoprotein E, onto the cholesterol-containing lipid nanoparticle surface in vivo 26 . Short peptides have also been used to manipulate the binding modes of serum apolipoproteins on the nanoparticle surface to improve delivery across the blood-brain barrier 27 . Although interference from non-specific adsorption needs to be carefully characterized 28 , this approach suggested the possibility of modulating corona proteins more precisely and using them as additional functionality",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 4 protein corona formation had a major impact on the cellular uptake towards HeLa cells. Therefore, we aimed to deeply investigate the interaction of the protein nanocapsules with blood proteins. All nanocapsules were incubated with human serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Protein corona coated nanocapsules were isolated via centrifugation and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S4-6 \u2020), Pierce Assay (Fig. S3 \u2020) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 6). A full list of all identified proteins is provided in a separate supporting Excel Sheet. \n\nAll corona proteins identified by mass spectrometry were classified into eight different protein groups depending on their biological function and are summarized in Fig. 6. We found that regardless of the protein type and crosslinker, there was no specific enrichment of one or two major protein classes in the protein corona of all nanocapsules (see also protein corona profiles Fig. S4-S6 \u2020). This is in strong contrast to other nanocarrier systems such as nanocapsules prepared from hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 43,44 or polystyrene nanoparticles. 30,45 Generally, for those systems, one or two protein groups (e.g. lipoproteins or serum albumin) are the dominant class proteins with an overall amount between 50-70%. Next to this, the absolute amount of corona proteins (Fig. S3 \u2020), which bound to all protein nanocapsules was comparable (<500 \u00b5g m \u22122 surface area) and significantly lower compared to polystyrene nanoparticles (\u223c2-3 mg m \u22122 ) or HES nanocapsules (\u223c1 mg m \u22122 ). This could possibly be a result of different hydrophilicities of the materials and the fact that proteins are natural molecules also occurring in the human body. This was already found for other nanocarriers made from  \"body-similar\" components. 30,46,47 However, having a closer look at the individual protein classes, we found that the crosslinker type (TAD vs. TDI) had an influence on the relative amount of specific protein classes.",

            "text": "Additionally, the corona formation around the liposomes was visualized 44 with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, see Figure 5C). The spherical liposome structure was preserved during the centrifugation process, which is not universally valid for all liposomes. The liposomes were comparably stable because of the high amount of Chol that was incorporated into the lipid membrane. When zoomed in on the sample, even parts of the protein corona itself could be observed as indicated by the red arrows. \n\nAs the protein coronas were quite similar for all liposome samples, with only L-hbPG showing slight deviations with regard to their corona composition, the influence of the different surface functionalizations on the cellular uptake by macrophages (RAW264.7) was investigated. A decreased uptake of a nanocarrier by macrophages is known to lead to reduced clearance by the immune system and, therefore, to a potentially longer blood circulation time with a correspondingly higher probability for the nanocarrier to reach its target location in the body. 45,46 n Figure 6A, the cell uptake results obtained from flow cytometry measurements after 2 and 24 h of incubation for all liposome samples (7.5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) are represented. For the formation of the protein corona, different plasma concentrations (0, 5, and 100%) were chosen to detect any concentration dependency, as observed by Monopoli et al. for different systems. 47 Interestingly, when first comparing the liposome uptake behavior with and without protein corona, there was no significant change visible. After 2 h incubation time, the number of positive cells was generally very low (<10%). Liposomes functionalized with PEG chains (L-PEG) showed an even lower cellular uptake than the other two samples, even though their protein corona composition only differed very slightly from the unfunctionalized liposomes (Lun). This reduced cellular uptake of L-PEG could be caused by an inhibition of the scavenger receptor-mediated cellular uptake. These scavenger receptors can be found on macrophages and were reported to recognize PEG, especially in combination with albumin. 48,49",

Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "Moreover, the corona composition varies depending on the biological environment in which nanoparticles are dispersed 13,16,17 . In contrast, the formed protein corona may play a modulatory role in the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, thereby affecting the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, cellular association, and targeting ability of nanoparticles 18,19 . Protein corona can even been utilized as a targeting strategy to direct nanoparticles into specific cells 20e22 . It is believed that any nanoparticles inevitably adsorb proteins when entering the biofluid 23 . In the case of PEGylated nanoparticle system, although PEGylation could reduce protein absorption 24 , protein corona still occurs 25,26 . In addition, several literatures reported that some PEGylated nanoparticles exhibited rapid elimination upon repeated administration, with an increased accumulation in the liver and spleen 27,28 . Macrophages in the liver and spleen were speculated as the main cells to capture the nanoparticles 29 . These effects were likely due to complement proteins and anti-PEG antibodies adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles 28,30 . Therefore, we hypothesize that drug loading and dosing frequency might change the composition of protein corona on PEG-PLA nanoparticles, and thereby affect their brain delivery property and microglia-targeted accumulation. \n\nTo test the above hypothesis, here we firstly determined and compared the brain delivery and microglia-targeting efficiency of PEG-PLA nanoparticles under different loading conditions (unloaded or aM-loaded) and dosing frequency (single dose or multiple doses). To study the role of protein corona in this process, we then prepared protein corona formed on the blank PEG-PLA nanoparticles (NP) and NP-aM by exposing them to plasma obtained from different conditions (from animal untreated or treated with the nanoparticles for 7 days) in vitro, and determined the cellular uptake of the nanoparticle-corona complexes (NP-corona complexes) in b.End3 (brain capillary endothelial cell line) and BV-2 microglial cells.",

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

            "text": "Therefore, we might predict that more mature macrophage cells could demonstrate greater SFG complex uptake. Moreover, Lunov et al. showed that PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells could change their nanoparticle uptake profiles and mechanisms compared to undifferentiated THP-1 cells [38]. Thus, future activated macrophage cells or more macrophage-like cells studies could provide additional valuable information. The results also highlight the importance of choosing appropriate in vitro cell system to address the desired endpoint. \n\nWhen nanoparticles are introduced into the in vitro biological system, they can rapidly interact with the serum proteins, generating a dynamic protein corona layer. The protein corona alters nanoparticle physiochemical properties, affects its interaction with cells, and defines the biological properties of nanoparticles [44,45]. It is the nanoparticle-protein corona that affects cellular uptake and nanoparticle internalization in living cell systems. On the other hand, the nature of the nanoparticles also determines the composition of proteins in the corona. Even for a specific nanoparticle material type, the size of the nanoparticle and its surface modifications are able to considerably change the nature of the biologically active proteins in the corona and thereby change the cellular uptake [46]. Different from THP-1 and U937 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), HL-60 cells were incubated in IMDM with 20% FBS. Although albumin is the most abundant protein in the FBS and is also the main corona component after incubation in cell culture media, the stability of the protein corona requires the presence of other adsorbed proteins on the particle's surface [47]. Cheng et al. presented different Au nanoparticle uptake profiles in RAW264.7 cells in the absence and presence of serum [48]. More FBS content, different cell culture medium components, and distinct cell membrane properties account for different formations of the protein corona, thus causing distinct cellular iron uptake profile in HL-60 cells.",

            "text": "In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6). \n\nApart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3-induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1). Multi-angle dynamic light scattering revealed a larger size of pristine nanocarriers compared to the PEGylated formulations in protein-free media, and a smaller particle size under protein corona conditions. This might be due to changes in the light scattering properties and/or a reduction in aggregation after PEGylation. Regarding the surface charge of the nanocarriers, all samples presented a rather neutral zeta potential, which consistently appeared slightly negative for all mouse plasma pre-incubated nanocarrier formulations.",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

[90], who verified the alteration of the proteins that formed the corona after submitting it to plasmonic heat induction. In this experiment, gold nanorods were used and immersed in fetal bovine serum (FBS) at different concentrations -10% to mimic in vitro milieu and 100% that mimic in vivo milieu. The protein corona was then evaluated before and after exposure to plasmonic heat induction in both concentrations, and by LC-MS/MS, it was found that, at room temperature, at 10% FBS the most abundant proteins were apolipoprotein A-I precursor and the hemoglobin fetal subunit beta, while the least abundant was the apolipoprotein C-III precursor. At room temperature at 100% FBS, the protein corona was rich in the apolipoprotein A-II precursor and also in hemoglobin fetal subunit beta, while the most scarce was the apolipoprotein C-III precursor as well. After exposure to plasmonic heat induction, at 10% FBS the most abundant proteins became the \u03b1-2-HS-glycoprotein precursor and the apolipoprotein A-II precursor, while hemoglobin fetal subunit beta maintaining its numerousness and hemoglobin became the least frequent protein. At 100% FBS after plasmonic heat induction, \u03b1-2-HS-glycoprotein precursor also became the most frequent one, followed by hemoglobin fetal subunit beta as well, having a very significant decrease in the quantity of apolipoprotein A-II precursor but still having the apolipoprotein C-III precursor as the least prevalent of all the proteins evaluated.",

Upon coming in contact with biological fluids (e.g. blood), nanocarriers are rapidly covered by biomolecules (proteins, lipids, etc.) which results in the formation of a surface layer, widely known as the biomolecular corona. The biomolecular corona subsequently confers a certain biological identity to the corona-covered nanocarriers which can be crucial during their subsequent interactions with cells or other biological entities. In contrast to the proteins of the corona, little is known about the impact of the non-protein constituents of the corona, such as sugars. Here, we investigate the role of protein glycosylation of the corona in cellular uptake. We show that deglycosylation of clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein AI (Apo AI) significantly changes (increases and decreases, respectively) the cellular uptake of nanocarriers covered with these proteins.",

However, as demonstrated by Figure 5, there were no significant effects of plasma proteins on the liposome consumption by endothelial (target) EA.hy926 and pro-monocytic (potential offtarget) U937 cultured cells. One of the reasons could be the overall low liposome uptake by the cells in the presence of plasma. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that in the process of nanoparticle-cell interaction, the cell features contribute to the intensity of the uptake not less than the nanoparticle, in our case liposome, features do, with subtle differences in the liposome surface chemistry poorly sensed by the cells [79]. What matters more is the source of the proteins that form the protein corona, if any (Figure S4 compares PBS, FBS, HP), and whether the liposome-protein complexes are presented to the cells  S3 for the lists of differentially adsorbed proteins.

[65][66][67][68] Effectively what it means is that, the original nanoparticle surface is not seen by the cell membrane, but rather those biomolecules which remain on the nanoparticle surface for long enough. Thus, cell membrane receptors will interact with biomolecules in the corona, and, presumably, this interaction will determine by which mechanism the nanoparticle enters the cell. 69,70 Subsequently, one would hypothesize that once inside, the biomolecules in the corona -if, indeed, the remain associated with the nanoparticle 71-73 -will determine to where the nanoparticle is shuttled, including if it is sent through to the other side of the barrier. This puts the spotlight on identifying which biomolecules are found in the corona, and which remain there for long times. It is noteworthy that the corona composition is not a simple reflection of the biofluid in which the nanoparticle is found. That is, if a nanoparticle is put into blood plasma with serum albumin as its main component, this does not imply that serum albumin is the main component of the nanoparticle corona. 49 Rather, low abundant species are frequently picked up by nanoparticles, and, in general, the corona depends strongly on nanoparticle properties such as surface, 74 size, 61,74 shape 75 and even concentration of the biofluid. 60 Importance in vivo It seems clear that the corona will be a key determinant of how the nanoparticles are processed in vivo. In a sense, this has already been partly demonstrated.

            "text": "The constituents of the protein corona, shown in Figure 16 and Table 1, display an abundance of transport proteins, including several albumin proteins, but a lack of immunoglobulins. Some coagulation factors and acute phase reactants are present, which may contribute to opsonisation. \n\nOpsonisation is the process of 'tagging' foreign bodies with opsonins to facilitate clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. Opsonins are mostly immunoglobulins, complement proteins and fibrinogen. On the other hand, there are molecules in the plasma which protect foreign molecules from clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. These include albumins and apolipoproteins, both of which were observed in our nanoparticle protein corona. \n\nIn conclusion, the nanoparticles we fabricated in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM formed a unique protein corona consisting mainly of transport proteins with lack of presence of common opsonins. This suggests that these nanoparticles will be less likely to be cleared out by the reticuloendothelial system and thus would have an increased half-life in plasma. Limitations concerning protein corona would relate to its effect on increasing the particle size, which would undermine the EPR effect crucial for accumulation of the particles in target tissues [11,26]. \n\nIn summary, the benchwork and in vitro experiments displayed a potential for MgF 2 particles to be used as a drug delivery system. Modifications to the nanocrystals will be needed to improve drug binding affinity and cellular uptake. The efficacy of the particles in vivo is yet to be assessed, as is the capability of surface modification with ligands to improve specific targeting and avoid sequestration in the liver and reticuloendothelial systems.",

            "text": "Background Nanoparticles, which are exposed to biological fluids are rapidly interacting with proteins and other biomolecules forming a corona. In addition to dimension, charge and material the distinct protein corona influences the interplay of nanoparticles with tissue barriers. In this study we were focused on the impact of in situ formed human plasma protein corona on the transfer of 80\u00a0nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-particles) across the human placenta. To study materno-to fetal PS transfer we used the human ex vivo placental perfusion approach, which represents an intact and physiological tissue barrier. To analyze the protein corona of PS particles we performed shotgun proteomics of isolated nanoparticles before and after tissue exposure. Results Human plasma incubated with PS-particles of 80\u00a0nm and subsequent formed protein corona enhanced the transfer across the human placenta compared to PS-corona formed by bovine serum albumin and dextran which served as a control. Quantitative and qualitative changes of plasma proteins determined the changes in PS transfer across the barrier. Based on the analysis of the PS-proteome two candidate proteins, namely human albumin and immunoglobulin G were tested if these proteins may account for the enhanced PS-transfer across the placenta. Interestingly, the protein corona formed by human albumin significantly induced the transfer of PS-particles across the tissue compared to the formed IgG-corona. Conclusion In total we demonstrate the PS corona dynamically and significantly evolves upon crossing the human placenta. Thus, the initial composition of PS particles in the maternal circulation is not predictive for their transfer characteristics and performance once beyond the barrier of the placenta. The precise mechanism of these effects remains to be elucidated but highlights the importance of using well designed biological models when testing nanoparticles for biomedical applications.",

Coated PS-NH 2 nanoparticles (with IgG depleted plasma) displayed a significantly lower internalization rate compared to uncoated PS-NH 2 in both cases (+with or \u2212without plasma). \n\nAnalyzing the protein corona of uncoated PS-NH 2 indicates a strong enrichment of clusterin (\u223c60%). Lower amounts of clusterin (\u223c20%) were observed for nanoparticles incubated with IgG depleted plasma (Fig. 4C). Clusterin has been identified as major corona protein of PEGylated nanoparticles 19 and it was found that clusterin reduces interactions with macrophages. 22 The here presented PS nanoparticles are stabilized with the non-ionic surfactant Lutensol AT50, which has a PEG analog structure and therefore the interaction with clusterin is favored. \n\nWe were able to confirm that via pre-coating with clusterin cellular uptake of the here investigated PS-NH 2 was strongly decreased (Fig. 4D). However, it has to be noted that the uptake levels of PS-NH 2 after plasma incubation were even lower meaning that also other corona proteins, their orientation or even other biomolecules (e.g. sugar, lipids) may contribute to this effect. Overall, this demonstrates that PS-NH 2 nanoparticles are surrounded by a protein corona with natural stealth properties as due to plasma coating interactions with phagocytic cells are reduced.",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

NPs in the blood can function as scaffolds that attract specific proteins from the plasma; this may be due to the fact that tumor antibodies appear early in the plasma of patients and these antibodies are specific for each patient and disease [16].\n\nAs was said before, a single change in the physical properties of NPs may change the composition of the protein corona. Treuel and Nienhaus [17] found that the composition of the corona was affected by the size of NPs. Proteins tend to accumulate more on larger-sized NPs (100 nm) than on smaller-sized NPs, whereas proteins with higher affinity tend to bind more to smaller NPs (20 nm) [17]. e nature of the protein corona could influence the NP-cellular interactions (internalization) since the corona is the first point of contact between the NPs and the tumor cells [17].\n\nFor example, immunoglobulin binding to the NPs is called particle opsonisation and as a consequence leads to a rapid receptor-mediated phagocytosis uptake [18].  Furthermore, a higher degree of protein coverage has been found on hydrophobic NPs, compared to similar-sized hydrophilic NPs [19]. e corona may also increase the targeting capability of the NPs, if the binding site of the NPs is governed by the protein corona itself. In order to exploit this mechanism, it is necessary to understand which proteins deliver the NPs to which location [20]. As one example, Aoyama et al. found that the cluster in the protein corona could play a key role in the stealth effect by inhibiting the cellular uptake of silver NPs by phagocytic cells (macrophages) [21].

[18] presented the first quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of the nanoparticle protein corona. These methods enabled the researchers to identify the functional consequences of the corona. Walkey et al. [11] presented the first correlation between the nanoparticle protein corona and size-dependent macrophage uptake. Tenzer et al. [18] grouped the corona proteins by pathobiological responses. In 2020, Zhang et al. [19] showed the arrangement of corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface and how the corona architecture affected their binding to cell and tissue targets. A hard corona can potentially contain a foundation, assembly, and binding layer (see Fig. 1). The foundation layer is the layer of proteins directly bound to the nanoparticle surface, which can bind to complementary proteins (such as an antibody-antigen interaction). The binding layer has proteins that bind to cells and tissue receptors. The assembly layer contains proteins that join multiple proteins on the nanoparticle surface. The foundational layer can be the binding layer if it has proteins that bind to the cellular target. Once a hard corona forms, serum proteins can still bind and interact with the nanoparticle surface, but the binding affinity is weaker. The binding affinity of hard corona is predicted to be nanomolar, while that of soft corona is micromolar. \n\nThe role of the biological identity in mediating the nanoparticle transport properties in vivo is not fully understood. Research efforts have shifted to probing the receptors responsible for the corona's impact on nanoparticle cell uptake and binding during circulation. Using chemical inhibitors, Lara et al. [20] started to identify the cell receptors responsible for binding the proteins on the corona. Ngo et al. [21] developed a genome screening, STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes), and mass spectrometry technique to identify the corona ligand-cell receptor pairing in determining nanoparticle transport in vivo. They found that apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein receptors are responsible for some of the nonspecific uptake of nanoparticles in healthy tissues in vivo.",

            "text": "Although NPs have been studied in a large number of preclinical and clinical trials, few NPs have been successfully translated for clinical use [11,12]. When NPs enter biological fluids after systemic administration, they interact with biomolecules such as proteins to form protein corona (PC) [13,14]. The formation of a PC changes the size, surface charge, aggregation state, and targeting properties of NPs, which ultimately determines the biological identity of NPs [15]. The biological identity of NPs plays an important role in the drug delivery, circulation time, cellular uptake, and cell recognition of NPs [16]. Nanoparticle-protein interactions and the formation of the PC are major challenges for drug delivery. Meanwhile, the interactions and PC may be used to decorate NPs and adjust the type of PC to enhance the targeting efficiency [17,18]. Therefore, by regulating the interactions between NPs and biological systems in situ, the surface-adsorbed PC provides insights into the use of the PC as a targeting agent for drug delivery and effective biomedical applications of NPs. \n\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE), an endogenous protein (40-70 \u03bcg/mL), is composed of 299 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa. The structure of ApoE segregates into two ordered segments connected by residues 165-200, which are random segments [19,20]. ApoE has many important functions. First, the amino-terminal domain of ApoE consists of a four-helix bundle. Its low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-binding region containing residues 136-150 is within this four-helix bundle and includes rich lysyl and arginyl residues; therefore, drug delivery may be mediated through the interactions of ApoE with the LDL receptor (LDLr) and LDLr-related protein 1 receptor (LRP1r) on cancer cells. Second, the lipid-binding site involves residues 244-272 of the C-terminal domain of ApoE and has a high percentage of \u03b1-helices [21,22]. ApoE, regarded as an exchangeable apolipoprotein, participates in the transport of lipids between the brain and plasma.",

            "text": "Stability issues related to in vivo conditions may include chemical and colloidal stability. Cargoes can be exposed to enzymes like, for example, RNAses in the extracellular space [274]. The in vivo environment can affect stability by affecting the nanoparticle's aggregation propensity [275]. High ionic strength in biological fluids may affect the tendency of nanoparticles to aggregate [275,276]. For example, DNA/PEI complexes aggregated at physiological ion concentrations to large particles of up to approximately a micrometre in size [275,276]. Carriers may also form aggregates with cells in the blood stream [277]. Aggregate size may influence the endocytic uptake route taken [278], and if aggregate sizes are large enough, they embolize capillaries [8,279]. Shear forces and the adherence of serum proteins like albumin contributed to the dissociation of polymer micelles as observed from in vitro experiments and in blood vessels of mice [262,280]. \n\nNon-specific adsorption of biomolecules on nanoparticles from the environment can form a \"corona\" on the particle surface in vivo [90,156,275,281,282], and its composition depends on particle-size and particle-surface properties [283] as well as tissue-specific presence, adsorption or desorption of proteins in the environment of the particle [90,284]. The corona can influence tissue distribution, cellular delivery efficiency and circulation times of the drug [90,285,286]. As an example, if apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is adsorbed to carriers or if components of the carriers mimic ApoE, this influences the distribution of carriers by targeting to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and subsequent delivery to hepatocytes [90,286,287]. Plasma proteins that have been reported to interact with lipid-based carriers and to influence their in vivo performance include highly abundant proteins like albumin, which may cause destabilization of particles or proteins that promote clearance by the immune system like complement proteins or immunoglobulins [288].",

[70]Indeed, this approach has been successfully applied in the case of Onpattro, the first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP for treating hereditary disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.The liver affinity of Onpattro has been strongly linked to its ApoE-rich protein corona, particularly through the interaction with hepatocytes via ApoE-binding receptors like low-density lipoprotein receptors. [71]Very recently this hallmark has been updated, as ApoE-containing high density lipoprotein enriched in NP-corona complexes was shown to be a better predictor of in vivo liver efficacy compared to sole ApoE.

            "text": "As soon as they enter a biological medium (cell culture medium for in vitro, blood or plasma for in vivo studies), nanoparticles, in most cases, see their surface covered by biomolecules, especially proteins. What the cells see is thus not the ideal nanoparticle concocted by chemists, meaning the biomolecular corona could have great biological and physiological repercussions, sometimes masking the expected effects of purposely grafted molecules. In this review, we will mainly focus on gold nanoparticles. In the first part, we will discuss the fate of these particles once in a biological medium, especially in terms of size, and the protein composition of the corona. We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data. Given the biological consequences of this corona, we suggest that it should be taken into account in theoretical studies dealing with nanomaterials to better represent the biological environment.",

A good correlation between SDS-PAGE and TG results in terms of total amounts of proteins adsorbed was established. The results demonstrated that more proteins, especially apolipoproteins, were associated with the particles at higher serum concentration regardless of surface chemistry and morphological differences. Also, the mean molecular weight of the adsorbed proteins was clearly lower under full serum conditions modeling in vivo conditions as compared to under dilute conditions modeling in vitro conditions, but functionalization of the MSNs by carboxylic acid functionalities reduced protein adsorption.

            "text": "Upon administration, nanoparticles interact with elements of the physiological environment such as blood, interstitial fluid, extra-cellular matrix, and cellular cytoplasm-all of which contain a complex mixture of proteins that adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles, forming a protein corona [62]. This protein corona changes the inherent synthetic identity of nanoparticles and is primarily responsible for their rapid clearance from the physiological environment through first-pass metabolism [30]. Many of these proteins mark the nanoparticle for efficient clearance by the RES (opsonization). Generally, larger nanoparticles accumulate in the liver and spleen more rapidly. In a seminal work, Walkey and co-workers systematically analyzed the effect of size and surface chemistry of a nanoparticle on serum protein adsorption and effective phagocyte evasion [13]. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, they identified 70 different serum proteins that are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of model gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and PEG grafting density [13]. At a fixed PEG grafting density, decreasing nanoparticle size increases total protein adsorption. In another study, a significantly lower percentage of an injected dose of 10 nm Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles accumulated in the liver compared to all larger nanoparticles ranging from 40 to 10,000 nm. There is still debate as to whether the rapid accumulation is due to simple filtration or increased binding opportunities between the RES cells and nanoparticles. Yousefpour et al. recently demonstrated the effects of albumin binding on tumor accumulation and liver uptake of polypeptide nanoparticles. Albumin binding decreased liver uptake of nanoparticle-bound DOX by 1.5-fold and improved tumor accumulation by 2.5-fold [56].",

At higher plasma concentrations, free HDL functioned antagonistically, whereas 444 reduced plasma concentrations resulted in lower free HDL, greater particle uptake and, 445 subsequently, improved mRNA expression. At the lowest lean plasma concentrations, there was 446 not enough HDL to populate LNP coronas, especially when using high doses of LNPs and this 447 degraded LNP performance. The number of HDL particles is, however, elevated in obese rat 448 plasma, so the LNPs remained functional even at low obese plasma concentrations, and under 449 these conditions, there was also less competition from unbound HDL. Taken together, these results 450 are first to indicate that LNP designs that encourage association with HDL or HDL components 451 will improve LNP performance by tipping the balance between LNP uptake and, free-HDL 452 blockade of cellular uptake mechanisms (such as SR-B1 53 ). The OPLS analysis also indicated that lipids (rather than lipoproteins) were contributive but less 465 decisive for LNPs' performance. Although one lipid hit LPC 20:1 did display a negative 466 correlation to LNP performance, and LNPs formulated with LPC demonstrated increased tropism 467 towards liver endothelial cells 56 , making LPC 20:1 a potential candidate for delivery to tissues 468 other than liver hepatocytes. 469\n\nIn summary, we have created an efficient method for isolating LNPs, with intact coronas from 470 plasma followed by an automated and unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of corona protein and 471 lipid content. We used this method to evaluate how corona composition affects LNP function (in 472 terms of effective mRNA delivery) by forming coronas in plasma from individual lean and obese 473 animals. Our study identified a lipoprotein fingerprint that promotes LNP function, leading us to 474 examine the role of HDL-LNP interactions as an essential factor for LNP efficacy. With these methods, it will now be possible to explore a greater variety of particles, biofluids, tissues, and 476 physiological states in order to more fully explore the relationships between lipid nanopar",

            "text": "Corbo et al. [199] compared the temporal evolution of the protein corona around leukosomes and control liposomes (~170 nm diameter each), and also their uptake by macrophages. Leukosomes are liposomes with leukocyte membrane proteins, including IgG receptors, coagulation factors, and complement proteins, introduced in the liposomal lipid bilayer to obtain NPs mimicking the activity of natural leukocytes. Both types of NPs were injected into the tail vein of healthy mice; blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture 10 min and 1 h after injection and the proteins adsorbed to the liposomes were identified by MS. Overall, leukosomes adsorbed fewer protein types than liposomes. One of those, clusterin, was exclusively found in the leukosomal corona. Interestingly, the protein corona formed in vivo increased the uptake of liposomes by immune cells but decreased the uptake of leukosomes. The authors suggested that the interaction of IgGs and other corona proteins with the receptors on the leukosomes prevented them from binding to their receptors on the macrophages. \n\nRecently, Hadjidemetriou et al. [200] presented a proof-ofconcept clinical study on in-vivo corona formation onto PEGylated liposomal NPs in humans, which had been infused intravenously into patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Protein-coated liposomes were subsequently recovered from the blood, separated from blood components, and the adsorbed proteins were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The most abundant protein classes were Igs, lipoproteins, and complement proteins, in agreement with an earlier study on mice [197]. Moreover, more protein species were identified in the in-vivo corona than in its counterpart ex-vivo corona. Interestingly, the most abundant serum protein, albumin, was essentially absent from the in-vivo corona. Instead, low-abundance, low-molecular weight proteins were present. In a subsequent study, liposomal NPs were used as tools to fingerprint the blood proteome [201].",

            "text": "With many excellent properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been treated as promising drug delivery systems for therapeutic purposes, like efficient and safe drug delivery without off-target effects [1,2]. Even though much attention has been paid to the development of NPs, there is still a huge gap between current NP therapy and efficient delivery systems [2]. One of the most critical factors that hinder the clinical translation of NP therapy is the complicated and unpredictable interaction between NPs and biological fluids that occur after the administration of NPs [3]. The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces [4]. This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs [5]. Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity [6][7][8]. As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs [9]. They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the rules and mechanisms of protein corona formation and understand the influence of protein corona in NPs therapy, which will provide guidance for the rational design of NPs and accelerate the clinical translation speed of NP therapy. \n\nThe formation of protein corona is rapid, temporally dynamic, contextually dependent, stochastic, and irreversible [2,10,11].",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64]. Despite considerable challenges due to the shortage of adequate techniques and protocols for the analysis of the extremely complex nano(protein)",

            "text": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

Various studies proofed that nanoparticles modified with HES (HESylation) [36] showed a reduced cell interaction and prolong blood circulation times comparable to PEGylated nanoparticles [31,37]. For the here presented study, it allowed us to recover a sufficient amount of nanoparticles from the blood stream for further protein corona analysis. \n\nThe protein corona of nanoparticles isolated after in vivo administration was compared to protein corona of nanoparticles, which were incubated under in vitro condition using serum or plasma. For plasma generation different anticoagulants were chosen (heparin, EDTA or citrate). Therefore, blood was freshly isolated via cardiac puncture from mice and transferred into serum and plasma preparation tubes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected containing only serum/plasma proteins. In our previous studies, we already saw that the anticoagulant (in this case heparin) can influence protein adsorption and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [17]. Serum and plasma was obtained from the same mice strain used for the in vivo studies to minimize difference in the blood protein composition. \n\nAlready by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A,B), we observed a radical different protein pattern for the in vivo corona (1 min of blood circulation, Figure 2B) compared to the in vitro coronas (1 min incubation, Figure 2A). For the in vivo corona, a broad unspecific protein pattern was observed, whereas the in vitro pattern is less complex and there are only 3-5 major protein bands. In a next step, we identified all corona proteins by LC-MS. From the absolute amount of detected corona proteins, we already saw that the in vitro and in vivo corona share only a minor number of proteins and the overall amount of in vivo corona proteins is significantly higher (Figure 2C). \n\nAs mentioned above, there have been publications, which already reported a significant difference for the in vitro protein corona pattern if nanoparticles where incubated with serum compared to plasma [38].",

            "text": "To assess fibronectin's impact on EV-mediated functional RNA delivery and uptake, we confirmed its presence on the EV surface. Additionally, blocking fibronectin on EVs significantly reduced both functional RNA delivery and uptake. Interestingly, fibronectin is not a membrane-bound protein; it is, however, loosely bound to EVs via its interaction to HSPGs. This signifies the importance of EVs' protein corona and its potential role in EV uptake and functional cargo delivery. It has been reported that the composition of the protein corona on EVs can influence their in vivo kinetics and could contribute to biological effects (23). As the protein corona can directly influence cellular uptake and organ biodistribution, it is crucial to thoroughly study EVs' protein corona and its impact on cargo delivery and organ tropism. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that fibronectin is more associated with \"dense EVs\", i.e. EVs with higher density (1.145 g/ml) from the 100K pellet (24). This suggests that different EV populations can have varying uptake properties and effects on recipient cells, which may, to some extent, be dependent on the protein corona, and could explain why we consistently observed only partial inhibition of EV uptake and cargo delivery when blocking the fibronectin/ ITGB1 axis. Interestingly, it has also been shown that targeted drug delivery using synthetic lipid nanoparticles is affected by their specific corona proteins (25), highlighting the significance of protein corona in uptake and tropism of nanoparticles more generally. \n\nFinally, we show that the fibronectin on the surface of EVs interacts with integrins on the recipient cell surfaces via the LDV binding site, while also being potentially tethered to HSPGs on EVs. Alternatively, fibronectin could be bound onto the EV phospholipid membrane directly (26). Disruption of these binding sites resulted in a significant reduction in both EV uptake and functional RNA delivery. Other integrin binding sites on fibronectin are available (Fig. 5A), with the most common site being the arginine-glycine-aspartate motif.",

            "text": "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

            "text": "Francia et al. (2019) found that silica nanoparticles dispersed in cell medium with different amounts of serum, yielding protein coronas of varying composition, were internalized through different pathways. The latter studies were performed using human cancer cell lines (HeLa and A549) as well as primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). It is pertinent to note that while the presence or absence of serum is important, the choice of cell model will also play a significant role in determining the uptake pathways of nanoparticles (Lunov et al., 2011). In particular, the activation status of professional phagocytes such as primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) will affect the repertoire of phagocytosis receptors including scavenger receptors (Gallud et al., 2017). Similarly, Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages, were shown to display a varying degree of uptake of nanoparticles depending on their activation status (MacParland et al., 2017). In addition to addressing which receptors are involved, and whether or not the presence of serum influences cellular uptake (see, e.g., Shannahan et al., 2015;Gallud et al., 2017), it is reasonable to ask whether corona proteins are correctly presented such that they might interact with the corresponding receptor(s) on the cell surface. To begin to address this, O 'Connell et al. (2015) performed \"interactome\" profiling for PS nanoparticles incubated in varying concentrations of plasma (1%-55%) using a human protein microarray containing 9483 full-length, purified human proteins. The authors found that a \"fully formed\" and biologically meaningful identity of the nanoparticles only emerged at higher plasma concentrations, which is relevant in terms of understanding differences between in vitro and in vivo studies (O'Connell et al., 2015). It is notable that the extracellular environment is dynamic, and that so-called cell conditioning may also influence the nanoparticle corona (Albanese et al., 2014;Dai et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The interactions between nanoparticles and proteins have significant biological consequences to the original nanoparticle and to the native proteic environment. On the one hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the nanoparticle physicochemical properties. It changes the size, shape, and even the aggregation state of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects how proteins are oriented and presented to the biological targets [17]. On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may trigger protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein functions and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune response to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability and enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface [6]. \n\nUpon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad of biological processes. The formation of the protein corona creates a different structure that will drive and influence the behavior and interaction of the nanoparticles with biological systems. Thus, the protein corona can alter the interactions of the nanoparticle with the cell surface moieties (e.g., antibodies), promoting or inhibiting the uptake of the nanoparticle by the cell [18]. For instance, in a case of study with silica nanoparticle, it was observed that the formation of the protein corona reduced the cell uptake by weakening their cell membrane adhesion [19]. The protein corona also plays an important role in targeting the nanoparticles to different organs [13]. \n\nThe biological impact of the nanoparticle interactions with proteins is particularly relevant in the development and use of the NPPC in biomedicine. The small size of nanoparticles gives them the ability to efficiently access cell compartments, which has important biomedical implications, leading to important developments in the field of nanomedicine [20,21]. The feature of the protein corona, which can direct the nanoparticles to specific organs or locations, can be used to design NPPC that can be placed anywhere desired in the organism or in the cell.",

            "text": "Furthermore, this raises the question if EVs would also need stealth modifications to reach their full delivery potential. As we found immunoglobulins enriched in liposome and EV protein coronas, we intended to test if the enhanced uptake into THP1 cells is Fc-receptor mediated. Fc-receptors are expressed on monocytes and macrophages and are one of the main receptors responsible for the clearance of nanoparticles (Gustafson et al., 2015). The receptor recognizes the Fc-region of IgGs. Therefore, adsorption of IgGs on nanoparticles can lead to adherence to the cell and ultimately phagocytosis (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). We therefore blocked cell surface Fc-receptors. Subsequently, THP1 cells were incubated with vesicles at 4 \u2022 C to avoid turn-over of Fc-receptors or internalization of vesicles (Figure 5). Interestingly, the mere cell surface binding of liposomes and EVs was higher in absence of a protein corona. In contrast, internalization of 33% DOPE liposome and EVs was higher in presence of a protein corona (compare Figure 3 and Figure 5). This suggests that binding to the cell surface (at 4 \u2022 C) and uptake into the cells (at 37 \u2022 C) is influenced by the presence of proteins differently. This can be explained as binding to the cell surface is determined by the amount of receptors on the cell surface, while uptake is a distinct process and a highly abundant or strongly binding receptor may only be sluggishly taken up while a receptor expressed in low numbers may be rapidly taken up. This also gives a hint that two different uptake mechanisms are responsible for the internalization of liposomes and EVs in the presence and absence of a protein corona. Indeed, it has been previously reported that the presence and composition of the protein corona can influence the uptake mechanisms of nanoparticles at 37 \u2022 C (Digiacomo et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). When Fc-receptors were blocked in the absence of a protein corona, we did not observe differences in the binding of vesicles (at 4 \u2022 C) as expected.",

The immune system may contribute to rapid clearance via phagocytes if molecules in the corona act as opsonins [289,290]. In an analysis of lipid-based carriers, it was observed that if carriers disintegrated in the presence of serum proteins with cargo release, in vivo transfection efficiency was poor, but carriers that aggregated and only slowly disintegrated upon exposure to serum proteins were efficient at transfecting cells [291]. Shielding agents like PEG have been used for carriers to prevent aggregation and to prolong blood circulation time [90,277]. However, PEG may also induce anti-PEG antibodies and result in accelerated blood clearance [292]. \n\nCarriers are more rapidly cleared in vivo if they are cationic and have the longest half-lives if they are neutral [268,293]. \n\nCirculation half-lives are influenced by excretion and clearance by the immune system. The optimal size of nanoparticles should be above 10 nm for preventing excretion via the kidneys, but has been suggested to ideally be not larger than 200 nm, a size that fits well through microcapillaries [156,294].",

            "text": "For instance, smaller NPs adsorb relatively more proteins compared to larger NPs due to having a larger surface area-to-volume ratio in smaller NPs. 227 Additionally, hydrophobic NPs adsorb more than twice the amount of proteins of hydrophilic NPs (12 vs. 26 \u03bcg of proteins per mg of NP, respectively). 228 Other studies showed that hydrophobic NPs have a higher binding affinity for apolipoproteins, while hydrophilic NPs favoured the adsorption of fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. 27,229 esearchers also found that hydroxylation can reduce the adsorption of certain proteins like HSA and IgE, which typically promote immune clearance, while maintaining the adsorption of ApoE, which prolongs circulation in the bloodstream. 230 Charged NPs can cause more protein denaturation than neutral NPs. 231 Studies on polystyrene NPs demonstrated that positively charged NPs have higher binding affinity to proteins with an isoelectric point of less than 5.5 (e.g., albumin), while negatively charged NPs prefer proteins with higher values (e.g., IgG). 232 Another study on various organic and inorganic NPs has demonstrated that their exposure to human serum albumin results in diverse corona formation and composition. These differences manifest in the hydrodynamic size of the NPs. 119 Porous particles decreased the amount of adsorbed proteins due to the size-exclusion effect. 227 In turn, coating NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), zwitterionic compounds or polysaccharides can also minimise protein adsorption. 233,234 owever, when targeting ligands are attached to the NP surface, serum proteins interfere with their binding to target cells. Conjugating targeting ligands to an equilibrated corona is an alternative to overcome the issue and enhance their binding. 235 n the other hand, the biomolecular corona can impact the NMs' physico-chemical properties and highly influence their circulation time, as well as their deposition in tissue.",

Apart from the ability to harness protein corona and tumor targeting, the bio-inspired pre-coating could also increase the stability of this NP system under the lysosomal acid environment and reduce its cytotoxicity. The anti-cancer cell proliferation and anti-tumor proliferation effects were studied in vitro and in vivo, proving that precoating the functional biomimetic albumin is an excellent and promising strategy for better drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic effects. Han Yang et al. showed another bio-inspired NP system pre-coated with cyclic RGDyK peptide (cRGD) modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) for impeding the formation of the protein corona, enhancing targeting ability to tumor cells, increasing delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs and improving therapeutic effects [79]. By preventing the protein corona formation, the pre-coating in this system played a dual role: enhancing the targeting ability of cancer cells and reducing serum protein adsorption for a prolonged circulation time (Figure 8B). Apart from the ability to harness protein corona Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona [80].",

            "text": "A protein corona is a dynamic multilayer protein structure on the surface of NPs, formed by the rapid adsorption and accumulation of various proteins (such as albumin, apolipoprotein, and fibrinogen) after entering the intercellular environment. As the interface between NPs and cells or molecules, a protein corona is essential to the biological effects of NPs and even affects their therapeutic efficiency. More than 90% of NPs are removed by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo , causing serious off-target effects and toxicity. However, monocyte phagocytosis of NPs may be affected by the formation of a protein corona, thus extending or shortening their blood circulation period and presenting opportunities or challenges to drug delivery design. There are four directions are proposed to discuss the influence of protein deposition on NPs, mainly classifying as follows: (i) targeting ligands are shrouded to cause reduced binding capability with tumor receptor, (ii) bioavailability is declined owing to enhanced uptake of macrophage, (iii) promote NP hydrodynamic size increasement, and (iv) deep penetration with tumor tissue is avoided by inducing NP aggregation. By changing its surface characteristics, the protein corona of NPs may affect the crossing of several biological barriers ( e.g., BBB), cell uptake, and targeting capability. Therefore, lipid NPs have been decorated by incubation with ApoE4 to enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in the brain [51] . The design principle is dependent on the high affinity between ApoE and specific receptors in the BBB. For instance, the modification of ApoE4 into polysorbate 80-stabilized lipid NPs produces an artificial protein corona, improving the BBBpenetrating capability 3-fold higher than that of naked NPs. Tf, a common target molecule with a high affinity for TfR, is used to modify the surface of nanocarriers to improve BBB penetration and tumor-targeting accumulation. The receptormediated transmembrane transport in the BBB is usually divided into three parts: the targeted molecules on the surface of NPs are recognized by cell membrane proteins for endocytosis, intracellular transport of NPs, and efflux of NPs.",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

            "text": "Summary When particles incorporated within a mammalian organism come into contact with body fluids they will bind to soluble proteins or those within cellular membranes forming what is called a protein corona. This binding process is very complex and highly dynamic due to the plethora of proteins with different affinities and fractions in different body fluids and the large variation of compounds and structures of the particle surface. Interestingly, in the case of nanoparticles (NP) this protein corona is well suited to provide a guiding vehicle of translocation within body fluids and across membranes. This NP translocation may subsequently lead to accumulation in various organs and tissues and their respective cell types that are not expected to accumulate such tiny foreign bodies. Because of this unprecedented NP accumulation, potentially adverse biological responses in tissues and cells cannot be neglected a priori but require thorough investigations. Therefore, we studied the interactions and protein binding kinetics of blood serum proteins with a number of engineered NP as a function of their physicochemical properties. Here we show by in vitro incubation tests that the binding capacity of different engineered NP (polystyrene, elemental carbon) for selected serum proteins depends strongly on the NP size and the properties of engineered surface modifications. In the following attempt, we studied systematically the effect of the size (5, 15, 80 nm) of gold spheres (AuNP), surface-modified with the same ionic ligand; as well as 5 nm AuNP with five different surface modifications on the binding to serum proteins by using proteomics analyses. We found that the binding of numerous serum proteins depended strongly on the physicochemical properties of the AuNP. These in vitro results helped us substantially in the interpretation of our numerous in vivo biokinetics studies performed in rodents using the same NP. These had shown that not only the physicochemical properties determined the AuNP translocation from the organ of intake towards blood circulation and subsequent accumulation in secondary organs and tissues but also the the transport across organ membranes depended on the route of AuNP application. Our in vitro protein binding studies support the notion that the observed differences in in vivo biokinetics are mediated by the NP protein corona and its dynamical change during AuNP translocation in fluids and across membranes within the organism.",

(2020) studied a set of polymeric nanomaterials with varying circulation times in mice and used proteomics protocols to probe the protein corona. This in vivo \"fingerprinting\" study showed that the protein corona changed dynamically over time. Hence, coagulation and complement proteins were decreased and immunoglobulins, acute phase reactants, and lipoproteins were increased in abundance over time. The authors found that nanoparticles that circulated longer were apparently able to shed some of the initial surface bound common opsonins, and they speculated that this continuous remodeling of surface bound proteins may be an important step in dictating the in vivo fate of soft nanomaterials in mice. \n\nPEGylation remains a common strategy for the preparation of long-circulating nanoparticles, although, as we have seen, this surface modification does not prevent protein binding altogether. Hacene et al. (2021) developed an ingenious immunoprecipitation method using anti-PEG antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads to extract different PEGylated particles including polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. Using Balb/c mice, the authors injected PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles intravenously, and blood was collected 15 min after dosing. After separation of red blood cells, the nanoparticles were quantitatively recovered from plasma (thus suggesting that the epitope recognized by the anti-PEG antibody remains available on the surface of the nanoparticles even in the presence of a protein corona). The authors determined the composition of the surface adsorbed proteins and found that apolipoproteins were enriched on the surface of the nanoparticles (Hacene et al., 2021).",

The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "Identification of all corona components, for instance by proteomics, is the very first step toward understanding nanoparticle corona interactions with cell receptors. Then, the next step is to identify which actual components of the biomolecular corona are responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake (Figure 2A). Dissecting the biomolecular corona could be extremely challenging, given the high complexity of this layer. However, in recent years, a straightforward approach has been developed to make this possible. The idea was based on using a library consisting of nanoparticles with various physicochemical properties to tune the corona composition and then associating the abundance of certain corona proteins with the nanoparticle cellular uptake efficiency. One way to do it is by applying quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict nanoparticle-cell association as introduced by Walkey et al. (2014). To this end, a combination of biophysical, biological, and bioinformatic methods is required, as illustrated in Figure 3. The study showed that, by using a library containing more than 100 nanoparticle formulations and measuring their uptake by cells, this approach enabled the identification of 39 proteins classified as promoters, e.g., \u03b1-1 microglobulin and hyaluronanbinding protein 2, and of 25 inhibitors of cell association, e.g. complement C3. Similarly, Palchetti et al. (2016) used this approach to predict cell association of 16 lipid nanoparticles. \n\nInterestingly, they showed that only 8 protein corona fingerprints were shown to be the most important stimulators of nanoparticle uptake in HeLa cells. In another study, similar approaches were used to identify liposomal formulations with a corona fingerprint that allowed increased uptake in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Palchetti et al., 2019).",

The components of protein corona rather than the nanoparticle per se are typically recognized by receptors on the cell surface. For example, in the case of DNAlipid nanoparticles, vitronectin enriched on particles associates with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrins on cancer cells [22]. Analogously, for targeting to hepatocytes, interaction with apolipoproteins is required for some siRNA lipoplexes [23,24]. Remarkably, the liver tropism of the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, is based on the ability of lipid nanoparticles to recruit into its PC apolipoprotein E that enables specific hepatocyte targeting [11,25,26]. Recently, the preformed protein corona was harnessed to convert nanoparticles targetable to tumour cells. For that, particles were coated with tumour-specific antibodies and human serum albumin that helps to prevent phagocytosis of the particles [27][28][29].\n\nOn the other hand, protein corona can interfere with targeted delivery by masking the ligand on the nanoparticle surface that specifically interacts with endocytosis triggering receptors [30,31]. The composition and properties of forming protein corona highly depend on one hand on the type and properties of nanoparticles, like composition, size, charge, hydrophobicity etc., [10,[32][33][34][35] and on the other, on environmental factors, like temperature, [36,37] incubation time [17,38] and, especially, on the biofluid type, [39][40][41] origin and disease [42,43]. In general, protein corona on the smaller nanoparticles is thinner and less dense than on the larger ones [44,45]. In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46].

In recent years, several ligands such as transferrin [17][18][19], apolipoprotein E [20][21][22] and cyclic internalizing peptide [23][24][25] have been reported to be able to facilitate the penetration of nanoparticle to BBB for brain drug delivery. Of note, angiopep-2 (Ang) is a promising ligand bind specifically to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) receptor and can improve the BBB transport efficiency of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery [26][27][28]. \n\nNanoparticles interact with components in circulation after injection, leading to the formation of \"protein corona\" (PC), which changes the properties of nanoparticles and impact their in vivo fate [29]. It has been reported that the formation of PC on nanoparticles may hinder significantly the interaction between targeting ligand and receptor, thus losing targeting capabilities of ligand such as bicyclononyne [30] and transferrin [31]. Moreover, the PC on synthetic nanoparticle would impact the receptor targeting, lysosomal escape, and BBB transcytosis [32]. However, there are also studies reporting that targeting antibodies on nanoparticles could retain their targeting capacity despite the formation of biomolecular corona [33]. Although the understanding of the PC on nanoparticles has been advancing in recent years, little is known regarding whether PC formation could influence biomimetic nanoparticles' cellular uptake, BBB penetration and targeting capacity for precision brain drug delivery. \n\nIn this study, we assume that chimeric proteins on biomimetic nanoparticle would occupy the surface and decrease the impact of biomolecular corona thus retaining its natural properties and targeting ability of ligand. Here, we developed EM by incorporating membrane proteins onto liposomes for brain tumor drug delivery. Ang was decorated onto EM for enhancing the BBB penetration ability. We found that Ang-EM have reduced PC formation by absorbing less serum proteins.",

Additionally, it was observed that a quantitative estimation of the PEG in the PEG-conjugated lipid chains in LNPs was the determinant factor for the successful transfection of siRNA for solid tumor therapy [85]. Deng and colleagues showed that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-coupled gold NPs adsorb and extend the fibrinogen from human serum, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines mediated via the positive interaction with the Mac-1 receptor [42]. For instance, an early report by Kreuter et al. addressed the fact that apolipoprotein E from serum adsorbed to polysorbate 80 NPs, which facilitated transport across the blood brain barrier [86]. Other studies have demonstrated that ionizable lipid nanoparticles bearing apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) ligand normally adsorb ApoE, resulting in a pronounced cell uptake into the liver cells mediated through several receptors withaffinity for the same [87]. Furthermore, DNA and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane-bearing lipidic nanoparticles had a high level of vitronectin in human plasma that was readily taken up into tumor tissues bearing the overexpressed receptor vitronectin (integrin \u03b1v\u03b23) [88]. It has been shown that silica NPs interact with a specific receptor after the formation of PC in human serum with LDL, and it has also been shown that IgG prompted uptake interceded via an interaction with the LDL receptor and the Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) [89,90].",

            "text": "In this study, we characterized the protein corona components of our recently reported Rf-coated SPIONs in comparison with the bare and citrate-coated SPIONs. The results showed that the Rf ligand significantly promoted the interaction of the SPIONs with the serum proteins, as their corona components were distinct in terms of number of proteins found and overall protein amount. The effect was believed to be through the changes of the hydrophobicity of the SPION surface rather than the surface charge effects, as the physical properties including pI of the bound proteins were indifferent among the groups. Proteomic studies revealed high abundance of interesting proteins in the Rf-SPIONs, including serum albumin and apolipoproteins, which could render beneficial effects on the biodistribution of the SPIONs. However, the most abundant proteins in the coronas belong to the groups of IR proteins and BC factors. These results suggested that further development of the SPIONs is needed in order to reduce the unwanted protein binding prior to testing in vivo. Comparison of the cellular uptake between the preformed and in situ coronas in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed the difference in short-term incubation, which suggested the importance of protein coronas in promoting the high cellular uptake of C-and Rf-SPIONs. At prolonged incubation, both kinds of corona formation showed a similar uptake pattern where the highest activity was observed from Rf-SPIONs, followed by C-and B-SPIONs, respectively. The results highlighted the properties of the Rf ligand in promoting the cellular uptake of SPIONs in the breast cancer cells as reported earlier. 2 With no reduction of uptake levels in both cellular uptake processes, our hypotheses are that the corona proteins do not affect the activity of the Rf ligand in enhancing the cellular internalization or that there are key components in the corona influencing the uptake mechanism of the NPs. This would require further investigations in order to test the hypotheses.",

Extensive information on their corona properties and interactions with cells is already available. 21,28,34,35 Furthermore, thanks to their density, simple centrifugation can be used to separate corona-coated nanoparticles from the unbound serum biomolecules, making isolation of corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes relatively easy (see Methods and Supplementary Table S1 for details).\n\nIn order to form different coronas and study their effect on cellular uptake mechanisms, the nanoparticles were dispersed in two very different serum amounts, a lower and a roughly 5 times higher serum concentration (12 and 62 mg/mL proteins, respectively). Instead of standard fetal bovine serum, pooled human serum was used as a more relevant serum source when testing uptake mechanisms on human cells. Similarly, as a first step, serum was selected instead of plasma to avoid additional complications related to the choice of the anticoagulant used to prepare it. 36 Exposure of nanoparticles to different amounts of proteins may also affect particle stability, and this, in turn, could affect the resulting interactions with cells. 37\u221239 Thus, the nanoparticle dispersions in (MEM) cell media supplemented with the different amounts of serum and the corresponding corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes (low-serum and high-serum corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes, LC and HC, respectively) were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS) (see Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S1, and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for details). In some cases, DLS showed small peaks at larger sizes, suggesting the presence of micrometer-sized agglomerates. However, the DCS results on the isolated corona complexes allowed us to exclude the presence of large agglomerates and confirmed that fairly homogeneous dispersions of isolated corona complexes were obtained, including small agglomerates (such as dimers, trimers, and similar) in the case of the complexes formed in lower serum ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S2).\n\nNext, SDS-PAGE was used to confirm, that\ue0d5as previously reported for similar",

            "text": "Following systemic administration, the biological processes that nanoparticles undergo, conditioned by their physicochemical properties, affect their fate in the body, making the targeting to specific organs challenging. Multiple mechanisms can be utilized separately or in combination to control where in the body nanoparticles accumulate, including passive, endogenous and active targeting strategies [59,60]. Passive targeting relies on modulating physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles, such as size, shape, charge and surface coating for nanoparticles to effectively interact with anatomy and physiology of the target organ [61]. In this regards, nanoparticles tend to distribute across various organs in a size-dependent fashion, exhibiting the highest accumulation in the liver and spleen [62,63]. In addition, clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation often results from interactions with cells featuring the mononuclear phagocytic system, which also favors their accumulation in the spleen and liver, being cationic nanoparticles generally those that are most rapidly taken up this way [62]. Endogenous targeting is a new approach based on the plasma protein corona adsorbed to the nanoparticle surface upon contact with the blood [60,64]. This targeting strategy involves modifying the composition of nanoparticles to promote their binding to specific plasma proteins after injection to guide them to a particular organ, promoting their uptake by specific cells within that organ [65]. In contrast, active targeting involves the use of specific ligands, antibodies, or other molecules on the surface of nanocarriers to bind to receptors or antigens that are uniquely expressed, or overexpressed, on target cells, allowing for precise delivery [66]. \n\nOur study systematically reviews molecules that have been used to target lipid-based pDNA or mRNA delivery systems intravenously to the organs therapeutically relevant in FD (heart, kidneys, brain and liver). The heterogeneous characteristics between the target tissues in FD requires tailoring the delivery system for each specific intended destination, which presents an added challenge. The brain and liver have been the primary focus of study based on the search conducted in this systematic review, whereas the reports that refer to active targeting of lipid systems to heart, ity to several receptors such as LDL receptor.",

            "text": "Indeed, in a recent in vitro study using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, Salvati et al 78 found that proteins in the cell culture medium can shield transferrin from binding to its cognate receptors on cells. Thus, although nanoparticles continued to enter the cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin was lost. In contrast, we previously observed that specific, i.e., FA-dependent uptake of FA-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles by human ovarian cancer cells expressing the corresponding receptor was observed only in the presence of serum proteins, possibly due to a stabilizing effect of the serum proteins on the functionalized nanoparticles in vitro. 104 However, while Fe 3 O 4 -SiO 2 -FA particles were specifically internalized, Fe 3 O 4 -PEG-FA nanoparticles did not undergo specific (targeted) uptake in the same model cell line; it is conceivable that the targeting ligand (FA) on the PEGylated particles was embedded in a matrix of polymers and therefore not accessible for binding to its receptor. 104 ndeed, Dai et al 105 reported that backfilling the surface of a targeted nanoparticle with PEG molecules reduces protein corona formation and noted that the length of the PEG molecules must be less than the length of the ligand linker; otherwise, PEG interferes with the binding of the targeting ligand to its cellular receptor. More recently, it was demonstrated that the formation of a protein corona does not significantly influence the targeting ability of antibodyfunctionalized polymeric particles toward human colon cancer cells. 106 In another recent study. Hadjidemetriou et al 107 reported on the formation of a bio-corona on clinically relevant, antibody-functionalized nanoparticles (liposomes) in mice. The authors found that both in vitro and in vivo formed protein coronas significantly reduced cellular internalization of the antibody-conjugated liposomes, using human cervix or breast cancer cell lines (however, in vivo targeting was not evaluated); notably, the in vivo corona formation did not completely prevent the targeting capability. 107",

The implications of these results together with the biological and biochemical mechanisms of endocytosis, lipid peroxidation, and enzymatic activity, could be an important issue in nanomedicine and nanotoxicology applications [82]. \n\nAfter a 2-h pre-incubation with proteins (HSA/transferrin), citrate-silver nanoparticles (20 and 110 nm) were studied as they acted on human epidermal keratinocyte (HEK) cells, and the cellular uptake showed that for 20 and 110 nm citrate silver nanoparticles, protein incubation significantly modulated silver nanoparticle uptake. Silver incubation with albumin and IgG, and in a minor extension with transferrin, reduced the extent of cellular uptake [81]. Moreover, IgG exposure dramatically reduced the 110 nm citrate silver uptake. Similar profiles were also found with silver nanoparticles in the membrane fraction with protein incubation in general, significantly altering the association of the particle to the membrane. Silver nanoparticles, independent of size and protein exposure, were found inside the cytoplasmic vacuoles of the HEKs. \n\nFigure 8 shows a transmission electron micrograph that has captured several 120 nm silica-coated silver nanoparticles in the process of phagocytosis by a HEK cell. \n\nThe 20 nm citrate silver nanoparticles bound to albumin were highly dispersed and appeared to break down or disintegrate within the vacuoles, whereas nanoparticles bound to IgG, transferrin, and the native control showed very low agglomeration. However, for 20 nm citrate coated silver nanoparticles, protein incubation reduced cellular concentrations, and for the 110 nm citrate silver nanoparticles, incubation with IgG significantly reduced the uptake of silver nanoparticles.",

Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes. Here, the authors develop bio-inspired liposomes that specifically absorb brain-targeted apolipoproteins and preserve their bioactivities, thereby achieving efficient brain targeting with minor influence on immunocompatibility of liposomes.",

[26] uch observations have motivated the adoption of a new paradigm, \"endogenous targeting,\" which seeks to modulate the protein corona to achieve improved targeting, often via chemical modifications to the particle. \n\nThe consideration of the protein corona has long been included in nanocarrier design. It was traditionally considered that the impact of the protein corona was undesirable, and the paradigm was to eliminate the corona completely by incorporating PEG into the NP formulation. In addition to regulating the surface charge, PEGylation also creates an antifouling hydration layer that inhibits protein adsorption on the particle surface. The improvement of delivery performance due to PEGylation was largely attributed to the reduction in the amount of adsorbed serum opsonin and the consequent downregulation of immune clearance. Nonetheless, it has been increasingly apparent that PEGylation cannot completely prevent protein corona formation, and that the effect of the corona is not entirely detrimental. \n\nIt has been shown that the ability of SORT to direct spleen tropism originated from the elevated level of \u03b22-GPI in the corona of the particle. [34] Such an observation was supported by earlier studies showing increased uptake by macrophages. [114] It was hypothesized that the recruitment of \u03b22-GPI can be mediated by the inclusion of anionic lipid in the formulation. Successful delivery to the immune cell population was also shown to be associated with a low content of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the protein corona. It was rationalized that ApoE leads to the capture of the particle by the liver through the receptor-dependent pathway, conferring a predominant hepatic tropism. Thus, surface chemistry that resists the adsorption of ApoE might prove a viable strategy for improving immune cell transfection in in vivo. \n\nOther indirect evidence supports the importance of protein corona as a major contributor to NP tropism. For example, the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies can partly be explained by differences in or absence of the protein corona.",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

            "text": "There are many Discussions about how the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution depend on the size and charge of NPs have been ongoing for many years. These characteristics are often discussed in light of the density, chain lengths, and other properties of attached PEGcontaining molecules, with a particular focus on how the PEG chains affect the binding of proteins (i.e., the protein corona) to the NPs (see e.g., [29][30][31][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]). The protein corona described in these studies often consists of proteins involved in complement activation, blood coagulation, macrophage uptake, and lipid metabolism. There are many speculations about how these proteins can contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and biological effects of NPs. Notably, it has been reported that there are differences between the protein corona obtained in vitro (mice plasma) and in vivo in mice [45]. Thus, more studies are needed to investigate whether in vitro protein binding data of NPs can explain their in vivo behavior. Uptake of NPs by the residential liver and spleen macrophages, i.e., uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) earlier often called the reticuloendothelial system (RES), is frequently reported to account for the removal from circulation of most NPs in vivo [29][30][31]43,44]. This includes the quantitative biodistribution study in humans of radioactively labeled liposomes similar to Doxil \u00ae /Caelyx \u00ae [46]. \n\nIt is possible that different proteins associated with the three PACA NPs studied here may contribute to the observed differences in biodistribution. However, as discussed above, we are far from understanding how the protein coronas may contribute to such large variations. We find it especially surprising to see such large differences in biodistribution with our three PACA NPs, with a similar size distribution, charge, and number of ethylene units on the surface (Table 1).",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46]. Thus, one of the potential obstacles for cellular uptake of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in vivo might be their inefficient association with cells due to the formation of protein corona on the surface of particles after introduction into physiological environment [47].\n\nCondensation of differently sized nucleic acid molecules to nanoparticles using various cell-penetrating peptides has been well documented [48][49][50][51]. Although the properties of such nanoparticles might significantly change after formation of protein corona on its surface, the composition of protein corona and its impact have not been studied so far. Only the increase of the nanoparticle's size in the presence of serum [48,50,[52][53][54] and the decrease in protein quantity associating with particle upon reducing CPP/nucleic acid molar ratio have been reported [55].\n\nIn this study, we characterised the composition and effect of the protein corona that formed on the surface of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles. Analysed particles contained plasmid DNA (pDNA) or splice-correcting oligonucleotide (SCO) that were non-covalently complexed with three CPPs: PepFect 14 (PF14), PF14 modified with a 22-carbon fatty acid tail (C22-PF14) [56] or NickFect 55 (NF55) [57]. We studied the formation of protein corona on different nanoparticles in bovine serum as a representative of cell culture systems, in murine serum as a typical animal model used in the development and testing of such nanoparticles, and in human serum as a representative of the actual target for drug development (Scheme 1). We observed that dissimilar protein corona forming in different sera translates to unequal uptake of studied nanoparticles by cultured cells and varying biological response to nucleic acid cargo. Our results emphasize that, as expected, the features of protein corona on CPP-nuclei",

These results suggest that in A549 cells and HUVEC similar mechanisms are involved in the uptake of the corona complexes formed in low and high amounts of serum. We then tested the involvement of the LDL receptor in all conditions. Interestingly, in A549 cells, as opposed to what was observed in HeLa cells, silencing the expression of the LDL receptor led to a strong reduction in the uptake of both the HC and LC complexes ( Figure 6B). For the HUVEC, given the poor silencing efficacy in primary cells, LDL was added to the cells together with the corona\u2212 nanoparticle complexes in order to assess potential competition for the LDL receptor ( Figure 6D). Although not as specific as silencing, adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled LDL caused a progressive reduction of the uptake of both the HC and LC complexes (the same was not observed when bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, as a control), suggesting that the LDL receptor is involved in their internalization, possibly together with other LDL receptors, for which LDL could also compete.\n\nUnderstanding all the factors controlling corona recognition by cell receptors and how these change in different cells remains a central challenge for the field, far beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, these results suggest that when the same receptor is engaged (in this particular example, the LDL receptor), the same mechanisms are involved in the following internalization. This confirms the hypothesis that the initial recognition of corona proteins by specific cell receptors can affect the mechanisms of internalization.\n\nAs a final step, we performed similar experiments using other nanoparticles of different sizes and materials. For this purpose, we selected larger silica nanoparticles of 200 nm in diameter and 100 nm DOPG\u2212cholesterol liposomes, as an example closer to the materials used in nanomedicine. Also with these nanoparticles, different coronas were formed by incubation with two different amounts of serum, followed by isolation of the corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes by centrifugation and\ue0d5in the case of the lip",

Although the purification process was accomplished, presence of the unbounded 68 Ga in formulations is probable that has renal clearance. Also, there was a significant uptake in the heart of the 3 groups of rat models that was due to the accumulation of the nanoparticles in tissue and blood pool. The animal PET scan was conducted to accurately determine the biodistribution and evaluation of blood pool or heart tissue uptake of the nanoparticles. It indicated that very small portion of the nanoparticles accumulated into heart tissue which is associated to the protein corona composition of the nanoparticles that was enriched by lipoproteins. Surprisingly, there is no meaningful uptake in the lung site in the representative rat models which indicates the appropriate size distribution of the nanoparticles in serum as the large nanoparticles mostly accumulate into the lung tissue. There was low uptake in spleen and liver in comparison with the other mentioned tissues that demonstrates low opsonization and clearance by Kupffer cells and long blood circulation time of the nanoparticles. \n\nFor quantitative assessment of target uptake behavior, maximum and mean activity concentrations (Bq/cc) were measured in all PET imaging studies (Table S1).

This is in accordance with the cellular uptake that was shown to be strongly reduced if nanoparticles were pre-coated (Fig. 2). \n\nAs described in previous work, interactions of NPs with plasma proteins can cause aggregation of NPs hereby highly affecting their in vivo biodistribution. 37 With multi angle dynamic light scattering (DLS) it is possible to monitor the size of nanoparticles incubated with plasma. 29,38 This method allows studying direct interactions of proteins and nanoparticles without applying any washing step. When uncoated PS-COOH nanoparticles were applied to plasma, an overall size increase of \u223c100 nm was measured indicating aggregation formation (Fig. 3E and raw data Fig. S6 and S7 \u2020). In strong contrast to this, we did not observe any size increase for precoated PS-COOH nanoparticles after plasma incubation.

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

The protein corona may also insulate the reactive surface of the nanoparticle and diminish chemical reactivity. For example, the redox activity of single, walled, carbon, nanotubes was suppressed after bovine serum albumin was adsorbed to the particle surface and formed thick and dense layers around the carbon nanotubes [60]. If the net reactivity of the NP is pro-oxidant, the protein corona may decrease cytotoxicity, but it may also suppress antioxidant activity [59].\n\nBeyond the effects of protein adsorption on NP activity, Horie et al. [78] examined the effects of protein adsorption on metal oxide NPs (NiO, ZnO, TiO 2 , CeO 2 , SiO 2 , and Fe 2 O 3 ,) on cell viability. The adsorption of the components of the culture media onto metal oxide NPs can induce a starvation state in a dose-dependent manner in cells-independent of direct cellular effects of the nanomaterial. The secondary effects of serum depletion on viability were impacted by the size of nanoparticles, the elemental composition of the NP, and the types of proteins adsorbed to the particles. Hence, examining the effects of potential contributions of serum depletion of media constituents is critical when interpreting data arising from in vitro experiments.\n\nThe 'rules' that dictate the process and nature of protein adsorption are not fully understood. Physical-chemical attributes of nanoparticles that influence generation of the protein corona include elemental composition, particle size, charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and the nature of surface stabilizers used during NP synthesis. These factors can each independently influence protein accretion, making it difficult to identify unifying principles for all materials that might predict patterns of biochemical activity and leaving investigators with",

[70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

Therefore, intrinsic interactions between magnetosomes and human plasma should be examined to evaluate their biocompatibility and allow for the development of their biomedical applications. \n\nIn this study, we explore the interactions between magnetosomes and human plasma and examine the effect of the corona on cellular uptake. We found that, after exposure to plasma magnetosomes become covered with a protein corona. The protein profiles on the surface were analyzed by quantitative proteomics coupled with bioinformatics to identify the potential cell receptors recognized by the abundant corona components. The results of the corona analysis show that magnetosomes selectively adsorb several plasma proteins on their surface and that cellular internalization is enhanced in the presence of a corona. Finally, we identified the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor as promising candidate target of the most abundant corona protein, apolipoprotein E, and this interaction appears to be involved in the uptake of the magnetosome corona complex by human vascular endothelial cells.",

            "text": "At the same time, the corona confers a new biological identity to nanomaterials and can affect the way nanomedicines are recognized and processed by cells [3,7,8,20,21,36,48]. Biomolecules present in the corona can, per se, have targeting capabilities towards particular receptors [17,18,[49][50][51][52]. For example, apolipoprotein B and immunoglobulin G in the corona of 100 nm silica nanoparticles incubated with human serum were found to interact with their corresponding receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively [17]. Similarly, lipid nanoparticles were efficiently targeted to the hepatocytes upon adsorption of apoE on their surface following administration [52,53]. Thus, controlling the corona composition can possibly provide new ways to control the initial interactions of nano-sized materials with cells. \n\nThe corona composition depends on nanoparticle physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, rigidity and surface characteristics [3,7,8,48,54]. By changing these properties, the corona composition might be tuned to contain components that bind to specific cell surface receptors and initiate internalization [17,49,[55][56][57]. Similarly, artificial coronas can be formed to achieve recognition by specific receptors. For instance, Tonigold and colleagues have shown that pre-adsorbed antibodies, which could be seen as a form of preformed corona, kept, at least partially, their targeting ability in the presence of serum [40]. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the effects of the corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells are being more and more recognized [41,58,59]. For example, multiple attempts have been made in trying to predict how the presence of the corona affects targeting of nanomedicines [60,61].",

Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

Advancements can be made to refine delivery to specific cell types within a target organ 165 . This is a key consideration for when a disease only affects a subpopulation of cells or the function of a specific cell type needs to be modulated to yield a therapeutic benefit. Delivery to cells beyond hepatocytes within the liver has been achieved through the incorporation of active targeting ligands or altering the protein corona. The factors influencing cell-level targeting in non-liver organs still have not been thoroughly studied, but can likely be affected by passive, active and endogenous mechanisms. Additionally, identifying nanoparticles that target as-of-yet inaccessible tissues, such as the muscles, the heart, the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, remains an active area of investigation. The current generation of extrahepatictargeting nanoparticles provides some mechanistic insights on the criteria necessary to overcome the delivery barrier of liver accumulation that can aid in the design of new carriers to other organs.\n\nContinued identification of the mechanistic factors undergirding delivery will pave the way for the rational engineering of nanoparticles. For passive targeting, linking nanoparticle physical properties to biological behaviour, such as circulation time and organ accumulation, will impact the general design of nanoparticle carriers. For active targeting, the identification of suitable ligands to avidly target a specific cell type, mechanisms to avoid protein corona and off-target accumulation and the ideal ligand valency all remain to be addressed. Interestingly, nanoparticles that use active targeting have not advanced beyond clinical trials; this may be due to various reasons such as added complexity of the formulations, limited targeting efficacy and possible off-target delivery 217 . For endogenous targeting, identifying which protein corona composition yields a desired organ-targeting outcome and relating it to the nanoparticle composition will be essential to fully capitalize on this targeting mechanism. Only recently has the importance of the protein corona been demonstrated for nanoparticles with distinct organtargeting properties, suggesting the need for more mechanistic studies that clarify how specific corona proteins influence delivery in vivo 97 .\n\nThe inability",

            "text": "In summary, this study revealed a previously unknown effect of intracellular exchange of protein corona components on CMA activation as a result of proteostasis disruption. The enhanced CMA activity arising from shedding of blood proteins intracellularly was further identified by determining the cellular metabolism at both cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 6). In brief, as nanoparticles migrated from the bloodstream into cells, the nanoparticles would disassociate part of their acquired blood proteins, which were replaced by cellular proteins due to their higher affinity for the nanoparticles' surface. This intracellular transformation of the protein corona further modulated nanoparticle-induced biological processes, including proteostasis and metabolic stress responses, especially glycolysis and lipid metabolism. This alteration of cell metabolism was caused by the interplay of coronal proteins with other molecules in the cellular environments. PKM2, a key molecule for cellular metabolism, was incorporated into the nanoparticles corona and subsequently dominated their biological identity. \n\nFor NMs used as nanomedicines or nanocarriers, a better understanding of the \"biological identity\" of their intracellular protein corona is crucial to ensure their biological benefits while minimizing their potential hazards. Biologically, proteostasis is central to cell function, and its disruption, as revealed by the current study, entails profound implications for mediating human disorders ranging from cancers to aging. Furthermore, the protein corona-induced CMA can influence cellular clearance of nanoparticles and alter cellular metabolism, which may impact the efficiency and bioavailability of nanoscale delivery systems. CMA could be a useful target for directing and manipulating the cellular and subcellular fate of nanoparticles. Such understanding of the intracellular protein corona, together with our existing knowledge of the physical and biochemical transformations of NMs in tissues and organs (11,57,58), highlights the complexity of the nano-bio interface and provides a crucial new molecular insight for guiding the safe design of future nanomedicines.",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

While there is an urgent need to understand the influence of this protein corona on nanocarriers' interactions with cells the strong impact of the protein source on corona formation and the consequence for interaction with different cell types are factors that are regularly neglected, but should be taken into account for a meaningful analysis. In this study, the importance of the choice of protein source used for in vitro protein corona analysis is concisely investigated. Major and decisive differences in cellular uptake of a polystyrene nanoparticle incubated in fetal bovine serum, human serum, human citrate and heparin plasma are reported. Furthermore, the protein compositions are determined for coronas formed in the respective incubation media. A strong influence of heparin, which is used as an anticoagulant for plasma generation, on cell interaction is demonstrated. While heparin enhances the uptake into macrophages, it prevents internalization into HeLa cells. Taken together we can give the recommendation that human plasma anticoagulated with citrate seems to give the most relevant results for in vitro studies of nanoparticle uptake.",

            "text": "The effect of protein corona formation on the cellular uptake of NPs has been in detail addressed by numerous studies [2,5,7,10,12,[166][167][168][169]. The current situation, largely relying on in vitro findings, indicates that the presence of the corona indeed alters the cellular response to NPs. For example, NP opsonization with immunoglobulin reportedly promoted receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages [155]. The presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was shown to suppress protein absorption resulting in a decreased uptake by macrophages [142] and longer circulation times in the blood as well as altered bio-distribution upon injection in mice [155]. \n\nAttempts were also made to coat NPs by specific proteins. For example, transferrin, well known to be internalized via its cognate receptor, was used to create a protein corona and study its effect on cellular uptake [11,12]. To elucidate how the presence of a protein adsorption layer around NPs affects their cellular uptake, Jiang, Nienhaus et al. [12] compared the uptake of small (diameter about 10 nm), carboxyl-functionalized polymer-coated FePt NPs (fluorescently labeled by DY-636 dye molecules in the polymer shell), by live HeLa cells in the presence or absence of human transferrin (TF) and human serum albumin (HSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium. They studied the uptake of the NPs by quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy. For comparison, they also studied the cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled (ca. 1:1 ratio) transferrin and HSA molecules. Whilst transferrin was endocytosed in significant amounts, HSA was barely internalized by HeLa cells under otherwise identical conditions. In contrast, the uncoated NPs were taken up in large amounts, whereas the presence of an HSA or transferrin corona both reduced the amount of endocytosed NPs with the exact causes for this behavior remaining uncertain.",

            "text": "The effectiveness of nanomedicine therapeutic strategies is strictly dependent on the design of the nano formulation since by modulating nanoparticle physicochemical properties it is possible to discriminate between healthy and diseased cells and predict the mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular targeting. However, the translation from in vitro to in vivo studies and from theory to practice is often affected by the complexity of the biological systems with which nanoparticles interact [96]. In personalized medicine, these factors need to be carefully taken into consideration, indeed, drug targeting could be highly affected on the basis of age, sex, target tissues and organs, metabolic differences, and concomitant diseases that can alter different biological parameters. For instance, after systemic administration, nanoparticles are often altered in their outer surface properties by the absorption of serum proteins that can mask the presence of ligands grafted in the nanoparticle surface necessary for a specific cellular targeting. The absorbed proteins, known also as protein corona, could drastically change the characteristics of the nano formulation with consequent hampered cellular uptake, inactivation, and premature elimination [97]. The impact of protein corona formation can be partially overcome by the engineering of nanoparticles possessing a zwitterionic charge in their surface and a global hydrophobic nature [98] or by the insertion of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains with low molecular weight [99]. \n\nBertrand and co-workers tried to understand how the physicochemical properties of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and their interaction with plasma resident proteins could modulate the biodistribution and clearance [100]. The authors found that a low PEG density reduces the nanoparticle clearance whereas a higher PEGylation determines an opposite effect. Interestingly, a total number of 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 represents a threshold value beyond which the circulation time and clearance of the nanoparticle remain almost the same independently from the nanoparticle size. In addition, this threshold value was found to be consistent in organisms possessing different protein phenotypes. On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time.",

            "text": "The divergence of protein corona composition in sera of different animals prompted us to assess the uptake of PF14-SCO nanoparticles carrying dissimilar protein corona by cultured cells. The association of PF14 nanoparticles formed with fluorescently labelled (Cy5) SCO with HeLa cells varied markedly in the culture media containing sera of different animals. The protein corona acquired in presence of bovine serum induced the highest internalization of PF14-SCO-Cy5 complexes (Figure 5a,e), whereas the presence of murine or human serum led to lower association of nanoparticles with HeLa cells (Figure 5b,c). In concordance with TEM experiments, fluorescence microscopy also revealed formation of larger clusters of PF14-SCO-Cy5 complexes on the cell surface in the presence of sera, compared to protein-free culture medium, suggesting association of complexes into agglomerates in these conditions. PF14-SCO-Cy5 complexes were not targeted to acidic organelles during the first hour of internalisation, suggesting that mostly macropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, i.e., the cellular uptake pathways typically triggered by PF14, were involved [89]. Surprisingly, the intensity of Lysosensor signal varied substantially in cells grown in media containing different sera. However, the lowest Lysosensor signal in human serum-containing growth media, and low internalisation efficiency of nanoparticles cannot be caused by impaired viability of cells, since HeLa cells are known to proliferate in the presence of human serum in normal manner and we did not detect any changes in viability [90]. , and acidic organelles (green) was captured in living cells with confocal microscope FV1000 and cell-associated SCO-Cy5 was quantified using Autoquant software (e).

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles exposed to biological fluids interact with plasma components, leading to the formation of a protein corona. The composition of this corona is also influenced by the physicochemical characteristics (i.e., lipid composition, size, \u03b6-potential, surface modifications) of the nanoparticles and depends on the biological environment in which they are dispersed. This modulation affects the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, influencing pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and targeting capability. However, the protein corona can also be utilized as a strategy to target nanoparticles to specific tissues [32]. Different researchers have utilized small molecules, including antioxidant compounds, peptides, and antibodies, for inhibiting pathological protein aggregation. Also, several lipidic nanoparticles have been developed to target neurodegeneration associated with AD (Table 1). Specifically, dual-modified liposomes with ApoE-derived peptides for BBB targeting and phosphatidic acid for A\u03b2 binding have demonstrated promising potential in addressing AD pathology. Research studies involving APP/PS1 and APP23 transgenic mice highlight the effectiveness of this formulation in reducing amyloid load. This was indicated by a decrease in both plasma and brain A\u03b2 levels [33]. Furthermore, liposomes loaded with the antioxidants quercetin and rosmarinic acid, incorporating apolipoprotein E and phosphatidic acid, have been successful in repairing A\u03b21-42-induced neurotoxicity in AD due to enhanced BBB penetration. This liposomal formulation exhibited neuroprotective effects by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, and A\u03b2 plaque formation in the brain of AD rat models [34]. \n\nOxidative stress, particularly due to lipid peroxidation in the brain, has long been linked to AD neurodegeneration [35]. Several clinical trials have been evaluating the use of the antioxidant curcumin in AD [36], but its hydrophobicity often results in poor bioavailability [37].",

The corona paradigm has been established since 2007 (2,3), underscoring the acquired biological identity of engineered NMs and impacting the therapeutic efficacy (4) and safety of NMs as well as their biological behaviors, including cell recognition (5-7), ligand targeting efficacy (8,9), biodistribution (10,11), immune modulation (12)(13)(14)(15), and toxicity (16)(17)(18)(19). \n\nMost of the current biomolecular corona studies have focused on the blood plasma/ serum, where immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, complements, and coagulation cascade biomolecules are enriched on the nanoparticle surface and critically affect the nanoparticle-entailed pathophysiology and toxicity downstream (5)(6)(7)20). However, most targets of NMs for biomedical applications are at the subcellular level (21)(22)(23)(24)(25), and thus, understanding NMs involvement in intracellular events is important to ensure their therapeutic efficacy (4). To date, limited efforts have been devoted to delineating the uptake routes, and very few studies have focused on the molecular cell biology once the corona-coated NMs become resident in cells and/or tissues. It is already known that the corona on polymer-coated NMs can exchange with other biomolecules that are both internal and external to the cell (26). The nanoparticle-intracellular protein entities can regulate the macrophage phenotype and induce a stress response of the endothelium (27).",

            "text": "organism, i.e., biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. It was observed that the adsorption of plasma proteins leads to reduced accessibility or interaction between exogenously incorporated ligands and their targeted receptors (Fig. 5). For example, several studies reported that transferrin-coated nanoparticles showed reduced or lacking specificity towards TfR in presence of the protein corona as a result of ligand blockade [260][261][262]. The resulting \"biological identity\" was highly dependent on the composition of the protein corona. In particular, in vitro protein corona depleted targeting capability, whereas a protein corona resembling in vivo conditions caused only a reduction in specific receptormediated uptake [261].\n\nInterestingly, two studies could prove that the in vivo protein corona even enhanced the overall uptake of the nanoparticles, hypothesizing redirection of cellular uptake by the protein layer and opening new paths for particle internalization [262,263]. As a consequence, plasma protein adsorption could also lead to redirected transport to off-target cells such as the RES, which hampers selective nucleic acid delivery and efficacy. In addition, Tonigold et al. observed that antibodies covalently bound to nanoparticles lose their targeting ability almost completely in presence of serum. Particles with physically adsorbed antibodies, however, maintained their targeting ability, probably due to the fact that these antibodies were not completely exchanged or masked by serum proteins [85].\n\nTraditionally, masking the surface properties causing plasma protein adsorption is a key strategy to overcome this issue and to maintain targeting ability. PEGylation has proven to reduce undesired interactions and consequently retain ligand-accessibility which is essential for targeted delivery in vivo [41]. One approach to further attenuate particle interaction with plasma proteins is PEG \"backfilling\" (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the surface of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264",

            "text": "This could promote rapid clearance of NPs or intolerable systemic effects such as anaphylaxis or tissue damage. To combat this reaction, PEGylation is preferred to increase its stability and minimize immune response. Despite this measure, Senti et al found that anti-PEG antibodies formed de novo or preexisting in donor serum-induced complement activation when interacting with PEGylated lipid NPs. This compromised the structural integrity of the PEGylated NPs leading to premature cargo release and increased risk of toxicity. These anti-PEG antibodies also induced C3 complement fixation, a mechanism that has been shown to lead to rapid clearance of NPs by the liver and splenic macrophages [174,175]. \n\nWhile crossing the BBB is crucial to delivering therapeutic agents for HAND, SUD, and neurodegenerative disorders, it is also the brain's most important defense against toxins and pathogens. As nanoparticles disrupt vascular endothelium, it increases the permeability of the barrier allowing its entry, but also exposing the brain to otherwise impermeable substances. This disruption could also facilitate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, the hallmark of which is endothelial damage, increasing risks of stroke and ischemic pathologies. \n\nOne of the major hurdles nanotherapies continue to face is the clinical translation of its therapeutic effects. Although extensive research has been done in vitro that demonstrates significant therapeutic benefit, the same cannot be said for in vivo studies. This could be explained by the protein corona. As nanoparticles interact with elements of biological systems within the blood and cellular environment, they form proteins that comprise the protein corona (PC). This PC is critical for determining nanoparticle targeting, systemic response, cellular uptake, and bioavailability [176,177]. For example, optimal uptake of nanoparticles is demonstrated in vitro with a size range of 10-60 nm and a radius of 25.4 to 30.2 nm, however, the PC exhibits more inhibition on larger versus smaller size NPs as shown by Cheng et al. with gold NPs [178].",

A mechanistic understanding of the dynamic interaction between proteins and nanoparticles and thus the biological fate of nanoparticles and associated proteins is, however, often missing mainly due to the inadequacies in current ensemble experimental approaches. Through the application of a variety of single molecule and single particle spectroscopic techniques in combination with ensemble level characterization tools, we identified different interaction pathways between gold nanorods and bovine serum albumin depending on the protein concentration. Overall, we found that local changes in protein concentration influence everything from cancer cell uptake to nanoparticle stability and even protein secondary structure. We envision that our findings and methods will lead to strategies to control the associated pathophysiology of nanoparticle exposure in vivo.",

            "text": "Studies of the protein corona formed on NPs have often utilized normal sera or plasma from mice or humans as sources of macromolecules [70][71][72][73]. Media containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and FBS are examples of sera commonly used in studies of the nanoparticle protein corona [74]. The most common coronal protein from these sources is albumin which comprises ~60% of the blood's protein content [16,75]. Due to its biological prevalence, biocompatibility, and capacity to target tumor receptors, the use of albumin to improve the delivery of cancer drugs or nanomedicines has been extensively explored [76]. However, albumin-based particles can also exhibit low circulation efficiency in vivo due to rapid immune clearance [77,78] and induce severe allergic reactions and other harmful side effects in patients [79], possibly attributed to poor tissue-specific targeting, limiting the approach of using such single components to pre-form a protein corona. \n\nUsing the capacity of NPs to bind or absorb select macromolecules from complex biofluids could result in a protein corona that confers a unique biological identity to the particles. For example, it was demonstrated that phosphocholine-derived liposomes could passively enrich themselves with shed complement C3 that consequently promoted their localization to pneumonic mouse lungs through neutrophil trafficking [80]. NPs can also form distinct biological identities based on their initial exposure to a protein source. When polystyrene NPs were incubated with either human plasma or human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), coronas comprising different concentrations of the same protein, or unique proteins, formed [81]. For instance, kininogen-1 was the 5th most abundant coronal protein in plasma-incubated NPs, while it was the 15th most abundant in CSF-incubated NPs. When analyzing the top 20 most abundant coronal proteins, serum albumin was found only in the plasma-treated NP coronas but not CSF-treated. The resulting coronal fingerprints on NPs may be influenced by variations in the concentration of individual proteins or protein classes found in distinct biological fluids.",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

            "text": "Another factor involved in the biological fate of nanosystems when administered to living systems is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) onto their surface. This corona corresponds to the shell of biomolecules (including proteins, enzymes, lipids, etc.) wrapping nanoparticles upon their entering within biological fluids [58]. As a result, a distinction should be made between the nanoparticle formulation designed by scientists and what is exactly recognized by cells in the bloodstream, i.e., the PC which will dictate the nanoparticle-cell interactions [59]. Depending on the binding strength between biomolecules and the system's surface, PC is generally described as a dynamic multi-layered structure ( Figure 5) [60]. Formation of a \"hard\" corona consisting of high-affinity proteins (i.e., apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and albumin) irreversibly bound with the particle surface is rapidly achieved within minutes upon incubation in a physiological fluid [61]. Weak protein-protein interactions occur between proteins from the hard corona and low-affinity proteins in the second layer, generally designed as the \"soft\" corona. Both layers are in a dynamic process involving continuous adsorption/desorption of proteins on and off the particle with varying kinetics depending on the contact frequency between the protein and nanoparticle as well as particle characteristics, such as surface area, shape, radius of curvature, etc. [62]. Depending on the type of nanomaterial, it has been demonstrated that the corona can have a size ranging between 3 and 15 nm [61]. Therefore, understanding the formation of PC around any nanomaterial is imperative to the applications of SPION as therapeutic or diagnostic nanomedicines as it may have advantages or disadvantages regarding their efficacy. It has been found that the entry route (i.e., inhalation, intravenous injection, oral administration) of nanosystems directly influences the composition of the PC and its evolution overtime in vivo [63,64]. In addition, it has been shown that loss of targeting properties, as well as a decrease of drug release (i.e., release of camptothecin from SPION or paclitaxel from",

These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

            "text": "n addition, non-ionic surfactants may influence the composition and structure of the protein corona, thereby altering the interactions of nanoparticles with cells or other biomolecules (Figure 4). The specific effects depend on factors such as the type and concentration of non-ionic surfactants, as well as the characteristics of the nanoparticles. The type and relative abundance of proteins influence the intracellular uptake and regulate the internalization of nanoparticles. Among the numerous proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticle surfaces, only a fraction can bind to cells. Less than 27% of the protein coronas can undergo antibody binding owing to steric hindrance. 173 Furthermore, only a limited number of cell receptors bind to the different serum proteins present on the surface of nanoparticles for uptake. 174 If the protein corona can be personalized to promote preferential internalization of the protein corona nanoparticle by diseased cells rather than by healthy cells, the therapeutic efficacy of the drug may be enhanced. For example, the formulation of niosomes with different surfactants and their varying proportions may influence the characteristics of protein adsorption, thereby affecting the in-vivo targeting performance of nanoparticles. Upon comparing niosomes synthesized from different Tween derivatives (Tween20, Tween21, and Tween80), formulations containing both Tween20 and Tween21 were found to have a relatively higher content of absorbed C1QC protein in the protein coronas and exhibited a higher tendency for internalization by cancer cell lines (HeLa cells for cervical cancer). 175",

            "text": "Once in the biological environment, NPs interact with biomolecules such as albumin in plasma and will form complex protein layers called a protein corona. These protein layers strongly influence the interaction of NPs with cells, particularly drug uptake. Based on the binding affinity and the time required for the exchange of adsorbed proteins, protein coronas can be divided into a high relationship \"hard corona\" that directly interacts with the surfaces of nanomaterials, requiring a time of long exchange and low-affinity adsorption, which can achieve biomolecules' fast \"soft corona\" exchange [95]. The protein corona's presence dramatically alters the nanocarriers' surface properties and provides a novel biological property that affects their actual physical response in vivo. Based on this study, Meewan et al. showed that pegylated zein micelles could effectively reduce the uptake of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in plasma without affecting the uptake of micelles by melanoma. This may be due to the presence of anti-opsonins such as albumin and apolipoprotein in the hard caps of proteins surrounding the micelles, which antagonize the biological effects of micelle-bound opsonins [96]. \n\nEnediyne natural products are commonly used for treating liver cancer and leukemia in the form of copolymers or antibody-drug conjugates. Tiancimycin A is a new anthraquinonefused enediyne that wholly, rapidly, and completely kills tumor cells. Feng et al. encapsulated Tiancimycin A in a functionalized liposome and demonstrated its antitumor activity using mice with melanoma. These NPs showed potent cytotoxicity against several tumor cells within 8 h. These NPs reduced tumor metastasis in a metastasis model, which demonstrates a better transformation [97]. \n\nAmong the various NPs under investigation, protein NPs, such as human serum albumin (HSA) NPs, are emerging as promising candidates for their biocompatibility, nonimmunogenicity, and tumor-targeting capabilities.",

To elucidate the role of sugars in the stealth effect, N-glycans attached to the proteins were enzymatically removed. As we found in Fig. 3-2, the (v)LDL fraction treated with PNGase F deglycosylase exhibited a ca. 4.4-fold increase in cellular uptake. However, this increased uptake was less than that of naked nanoparticles. This means that glycosylation is an important part of the stealth effect for (v)LDL, while also other components like lipids may contribute to uptake inhibition. Interestingly, PNGase F treatment had no influence on Apo B100, the main protein of (v)LDL, although Apo B100 has 19 glycosylated sites, according to the UniProt Protein Database (Protein ID P04114). Two possibilities could be the reason for the lack of this effect: either these N-glycans have no role in nanoparticle internalization or no deglycosylation occurred upon PNGase F treatment, because the sugar groups are internally located and the enzyme has no access to them. Since (v)LDL, besides Apo B100, contains other glycosylated apolipoproteins as well, the partial effect of increased uptake upon deglycosylation could stem from these apolipoproteins.\n\nA similar effect, i.e. increased uptake upon deglycosylation, was observed with clusterin (around 4.1-times increase). Moreover, deglycosylation by PNGase F could be easily achieved even at room temperature (data not shown). To confirm the phenomenon of increased uptake, the same experiments were conducted using",

Considering this, there is renewed interest in isolating and characterizing albumin-binding proteins or receptors on the plasma membrane that are responsible for albumin uptake. Initially, the cellular uptake and intracellular localization of albumin was unknown due to the large confinement of the protein within the vascular and interstitial compartment of the body. Studies have since assessed the intracellular localization of albumin in order to understand the mechanisms and pathways responsible for its uptake, distribution and catabolism in multiple tissues, and this is reviewed herein.",

            "text": "This was possibly due to redirection of nanoparticles to other receptors with higher uptake efficiency when the transferrin receptor was occupied by free transferrin. In other words, nanoparticles may have multiple ways to be taken up, possibly mediated via interaction of different proteins adsorbed on their surface with different receptors. Similar results were also reported in a recent study in which different pathways were involved in the uptake of hard corona-coated silica nanoparticles in HeLa cells. 13 Further studies and novel methods are needed in order to identify all alternative receptors or pathways involved in nanoparticle uptake. \n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the complexity of the protein corona in the way it can affect the interactions of nanoparticles with cells. \u221229 However, it is important to stress that correlation alone does not demonstrate a role of the identified proteins in nanoparticle uptake, and validation via other methods is required to confirm whether the correlated proteins do affect uptake. Additionally, one needs to take into account the possibility that cell receptors may recognize more complex surfaces formed by multiple corona proteins all together in addition to single corona components. 12 Therefore, future studies are needed to better understand protein corona-cell interactions, and at the same time, better methods need to be developed to identify which proteins have potential for the targeting of nanocarriers. Importantly, the presence of other biomolecules in solution also affects nanoparticle uptake, and their composition will vary between different cellular microenvironments. This adds another level of complexity to discerning possible ligand\u2212receptor pairs for targeted delivery, which should be taken into account in the design of targeted nanoparticles. \n\nWhile the role of individual proteins identified in this work, such as, for instance, eventual effects of HRG should be explicitly tested in vivo in order to determine their potential application, our results confirm that corona correlation analysis allows the discovery of proteins that have an impact on nanoparticle uptake by cells. The discovery of proteins promoting uptake can be used to develop novel targeting strategies directed at their receptors (thus, for instance, to make nanoparticles with antibodies or targeting ligands for the identified receptors).",

            "text": "Over time, these proteins may disassociate, making room for others with lower concentrations, slower exchange rates or stronger affinities. This phenomenon, encompassing the competitive adherence of proteins to a finite surface based on abundance, affinities and incubation time, is commonly referred to as the \"Vroman Effect\" [52,53]. This effect holds considerable significance concerning the distribution of particles within the body. The evolution of the protein corona, occurring as the nanoparticle traverses different body compartments during its circulation, may be influenced by fluctuations in protein levels and binding affinities [54,55]. \n\nThis holds particular relevance for nanoparticles due to the heightened importance of surface effects at this scale. Numerous studies have demonstrated that biological responses to nanoparticles exhibit a stronger correlation with surface area than with mass. Nanoscale materials possess significantly higher surface-to-volume ratios compared to larger particles, as surface areas decrease more gradually than volumes with diminishing size. Consequently, a nanoparticle with a higher surface-to-volume ratio is expected to bind a greater quantity of proteins in comparison to its mass, as supported by existing research [54,55]. \n\nThe impact of varying protein binding on the biological response to a specific nanoparticle remains uncertain, as does the process of protein binding (e.g., uptake by phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system and clearance). However, it is evident that the type and quantity of proteins present on a particle's surface influence the biodistribution of nanoparticles. A comprehensive understanding of the kinetics, affinities and stoichiometries of protein attachment and dissociation from the nanoparticle, as well as the specific proteins associated with the particle, is crucial for a thorough comprehension of the protein corona [56]. \n\nThe predominant focus of research investigating the impact of protein binding on absorption has involved preincubating particles with bulk serum/plasma, preincubating particles with specific proteins or attaching individual proteins to the particle's surface, followed by the analysis of uptake by macrophages.",

            "text": "Naked nanoparticles possess a high affinity for biomolecules, as they can easily bind to the nanoparticle surface through various bonding methods. However, pre-coating nanoparticles with biomolecules and proteins reduces the rate of interaction between the nanoparticles and proteins, as compared to bare nanoparticles. When nanoparticles are presuspended with specific proteins, a distinct protein corona is formed in vivo, rich in those particular proteins, which subsequently influences processes such as cellular absorption by specific cells. For instance, pretreated tiny PS particles modified with dysopsonins Apo A-IV and Apo C-III exhibit reduced cellular uptake, whereas coating the same particles with 2-glycoprotein 1 yields the opposite outcome. These findings suggest that Apo A-IV and Apo C-III may be beneficial for enhancing specific uptake, while clusterin coating effectively prevents nanoparticles from adhering to non-specific targets [114]. \n\nIn the context of PLGA particles, researchers have reported that small PLGA particles adhere more strongly to endothelial cells in the presence of IgA-and IgM-depleted serum, which does not occur in the presence of these specific proteins [115]. However, a drawback is observed, as biomolecules may form novel interactions with additional plasma proteins, resulting in the broadening of the initial protein corona. For example, Mirshafiee et al. coated nanoparticles with globulins to increase macrophage absorption [116]. However, the adsorption of extra proteins hindered these globulins from interacting with macrophage Fc receptors. Therefore, any in vitro evaluation of pre-coated nanoparticles should be preceded by their incubation in plasma.",

This corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' biological behavior, affecting their circulation time, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in drug delivery applications (Monopoli et al., 2012;Lynch et al., 2006;Walczyk et al., 2010). Overview of the general experimental workflow for RES blockade in vivo experiments. NU/NU mice bearing PC346C tumors were systemically injected with dextran sulfate (30 mg/kg), liposomes (360 mg/kg) or PBS (control), followed by i.v. injection of siAR-PEG-DSG-LNPs containing 0.2 % DSPE-Cy5.5 at a dose of 5 mg/kg siRNA. Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification.

Hence, NP shape, size, surface charge, elemental composition and hydrophilicity will steer each NP to one endocytic process or the other [128]. There are, however, few easily predicted and consistent rules about cellular uptake of metal oxide NPs.\n\nParticles between 10-50 nm exhibit the highest rates of entry in many cell types whereas large particles (~100 nm) and very small particles (1-2 nm) are taken up less avidly. The reduction in uptake of very large particles is attributed to agglomeration into amorphous particles that are too large to access classical endocytic pathways. Very small particles are also assimilated into cells less effectively than larger particles, although the reasons for this reduced accumulation are not known. Smaller metal oxides nanoparticles (<10 nm) tend to enter and exit the cell more rapidly than larger NPs [88], and the concentration of smaller NPs may be less at any instant even though the entry and exit of small NPs are more rapid. In nanogold particles, the protein corona significantly decreases cellular uptake efficiency in a size-dependent manner in in vitro studies. The accumulation of larger particles (~50 nm) was reduced by the presence of a protein corona whereas, the uptake of small particles (5 nm) was unaffected by their interactions with proteins [129]. The majority of blood proteins, albumin, immunoglobins, ApoE, etc. are large (100s of kD, 1000s of amino acid residues), so it is likely that smaller nanoparticles decorate these larger proteins and tissue targeting is dependent on the protein. It is possible that nanoparticles may change from cargo to carrier, and in the transition, the targeting and activity of the protein may be dictated by the NP, especially once the NP enters the intracellular space where intracellular proteins in eukaryotic systems tend to be small (196 to 1157 amino acids) [130]. The biological impact of the corona on cellular accumulation is further complicated in that the nature or amount of protein associated with the material, and any change",

            "text": "Medical applications of nanoparticles (NPs) are wide-reaching as evidenced by their rapid development as therapeutic and diagnostic agents (Peer et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2008;Hubbell and Langer, 2013). In particular, significant advances have been made in cancer therapy by pursuing NPs as drug delivery systems (Gu et al., 2007;Pearson et al., 2012;van der Meel et al., 2013), however, many challenges, especially with regard to achieving precise control over nano-bio interactions, still remain to be addressed (Chauhan and Jain, 2013;Pearson et al., 2014). As increasingly more complex NP formulations move toward later stages of clinical development, the need to understand and overcome those challenges is becoming imminent. \n\nOne of the most important challenges affecting NP-based drug delivery is the formation of the \"biomolecule\" or \"protein\" corona (Cedervall et al., 2007). As NPs enter physiological fluids, proteins and other biomolecules such as lipids adsorb to their surfaces with various exchange rates leading to the formation of the biomolecular corona (Figure 1A) (Nel et al., 2009;Monopoli et al., 2012;Saptarshi et al., 2013). As a consequence, the \"synthetic identity\" of the NP is lost and a distinct \"biological identity\" is acquired. This new identity governs how the NP is \"seen\" by cells and subsequently alters the way in which NPs interact with cells. The composition of the biomolecular corona is dynamic and is highly dependent on the initial biological environment, indicating the possibility of exposure memory (Milani et al., 2012). Opsonin adsorption such as immunoglobulin (IgG), complement, and others contribute to the deteriorated in vivo properties of NPs by promoting immune system recognition and rapid clearance from circulation. In contrast, dysopsonins such as albumin can coat NP surfaces and enhance their biological properties by reducing complement activation, increasing blood circulation time, and reducing toxicity (Peng et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

            "text": "In vitro studies showed that rod-shaped polymeric nanoparticles targeted to the transferrin receptor underwent seven-fold higher uptake compared to spherical particles [60], clearly war-ranting further pursuit in vivo. The nanoparticles' zeta potential is also important with slightly negative potential being optimal for uptake [11][12][13]. When present in blood plasma, nanoparticles tend to absorb blood-circulating proteins forming a so-called protein corona so significant that it may sterically block for binding of the targeting protein to its receptor [61]. Previous research on the liposomal protein corona may have suffered from significant methodological limitations making this issue too problematic as justified in more controlled experiments, showing that contaminating proteins may have interfered with the analysis of the protein corona [62][63][64]. To prevent a potential unwanted influence of protein corona on the targeting potential of the nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be conjugated to their targeting antibody bridged in-between by PEG molecules, which simultaneously will limit their likelihood of being taken up in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [9,10]. \n\nThe possibility of using the transferrin receptor for targeting nanoparticles to the BECs has also been pursued in studies using dual targeting approaches in which transferrin is linked to the surface of nanoparticles in conjunction with other peptides. Studies were mainly performed in vitro, with additional biodistribution studies in vivo using nanoparticles conjugated with transferrin and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), or rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) [65][66][67]. Although these approaches bear great potential, they warrant direct comparisons with antibodies targeting the transferrin receptor for efficient drug delivery to the brain. Other strategies examined the transferrin receptor targeting peptide T7 (aka T7-LS) bound to the surface of liposomes containing the chemotherapeutic vincristine and reported a significantly higher pharmacological effect compared to the targeting of liposomes bound to other transferrin receptor targeting peptides B6 and T12 [68].",

In line with the corona composition, cellular internalization of citrate and EDTA coated nanoparticles is comparable. Those nanoparticles displayed a significant lower cellular association compared to heparin or serum coated nanoparticles. As we observed a highly significant difference for the in vitro situation compared to the in vivo situation, we aimed for a strategy, which reflects the in vivo corona proteom. We developed an approach, which we termed ex vivo. Blood was freshly isolated from mice, transferred into heparin containing tubes and nanoparticles were directly incubated with this whole blood for 1 min. The ex vivo corona was purified in analogy to the in vivo or in vitro corona. The heat map reflecting the 20 most abundant corona proteins highlights that the ex vivo corona is highly comparable to the in vivo corona. In strong contrast to these are the patterns for the in vitro corona. This indicated that the ex vivo approach reflects the in vivo situation to the greatest extent (Figures 3B and S5). \n\nThe ultimate test for the influence of the protein corona is the demonstration that the adsorbed proteins change the cellular interaction of nanoparticles. As shown in a number of reports, due to corona formation, the cellular interactions of nanoparticles are strongly altered [40,41]. Therefore, we wanted to study the cellular interaction of nanoparticles coated with the in vitro corona compared to the ex vivo or in vivo corona (Figure 4). Cellular association towards the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7, DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Germany) was analysed by flow cytometry. \n\nAlready for the four in vitro incubated nanoparticles, we saw significant difference in the cellular interaction.

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

Most importantly, even if pre-coated NPs were reintroduced to plasma, cellular uptake was still reduced. This highlights that the obtained stealth properties due to the preformed protein corona were preserved meaning that precoating allowed us to control cellular uptake. \n\nBased on this, we now wanted to focus on the interaction between plasma proteins and uncoated or pre-coated nanoparticles once they were introduced to whole plasma. Here, it was questioned how pre-coating influences protein corona formation (Fig. 3A). The hard protein corona of uncoated as well as pre-coated nanoparticles formed after incubation in full plasma was isolated via repetitive centrifugation and analyzed by Pierce Assay (Tables S2 \u2020), SDS PAGE (Fig. S3 \u2020) and LC-MS (Fig. 3B). We found that uncoated PS-COOH, which were incubated with full plasma, were surrounded by a protein corona, which was strongly enriched with vitronectin (\u223c33%). In contrast to this, we did not identify vitronectin as being highly abundant in the corona formed with IgG depleted plasma. Here, the hard corona of pre-coated nanoparticles was enriched with fibrinogen (Fig. 3B). \n\nNext, we saw that there was no significant change in the protein adsorption pattern if pre-coated PS-COOH nanoparticles were re-introduced into whole plasma (Fig. 3C). This underlines the stability of the pre-formed protein corona (Fig. 3C). Hence, we noted minor differences in the corona composition. Re-adsorption of other plasma proteins (e.g. vitronectin) had occurred. Nevertheless, this did not affect cellular uptake decisively (Fig. 2). \n\nTo further investigate the properties of the pre-formed corona, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (ITC) were carried out (Fig. 3D and raw data heat rates see Fig. S5 \u2020). Plasma was titrated to uncoated and coated PS-COOH NPs.",

            "text": "nanomaterials that are delivered to the blood are bound by elements of the complement cascade, are rapidly sequestered by reticuloendothelial organs (i.e., spleen and liver), and never reach their intended targets [69][70][71], unless the liver or spleen is the target. Given the passive tissue targeting of many nanomaterials, there can be many off-target organs and tissues as nanoparticles move toward the intended site of biological activity. As a consequence of protein-NP interactions, the chemical reactivity and enzyme mimetic activity of metal oxide NPs can be more easily assessed in cell-free systems. However, translating the chemistry of the NP in cell-free conditions into predictable behavior in less reduced biological systems becomes much more complicated where protein-NP interactions are unavoidable.\n\nTo varying degrees, all biological fluids contain proteins that will adsorb to the surface of nanoparticles, a process that is affected both by protein concentration, protein composition, and the nature of the solute. The suite of proteins adsorbed to the surface of the material changes dynamically over time as the NP is exposed to different proteins and solutes [72]. The adsorption kinetics of proteins and NPs have two phases: a rapid phase that occurs on the order of seconds to minutes and a slower phase that occurs over hours to days [73][74][75], and the protein corona around each NP has two layers, proteins associated with the 'hard' corona close to the nanoparticle are tightly bound to the particle surface whereas the 'soft,' outer protein corona is associated with protein-protein interactions at the interface of the hard corona and proteins in solution. Thus, the protein composition of the corona provides an evolutionary history of protein interactions and a fingerprint of the solutions through which the nanoparticle has passed [76].\n\nThe biological consequences of protein deposition are profound. The nanomaterial can change the conformation of the protein, thereby modifying the biological activity of the protein (i.e., Mac receptor activation fibrinogen [77]) or conversely, alter the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle either increasing or decreasing redox reactivity, affecting clearance from biological compartments, influencing cellular uptake/",

The following subtitles embody the latest advances in nanosized particles and protein corona structures for biotechnological applications. \n\nYallapu et al. have investigated the sample of human serum protein corona (HSPC) formation with nanosized particles. The change in particle size, zeta potential, hemotoxicity, cellular uptake/cancer cells targeting potential, and MRI characteristics of nanosized magnetic particles were reduced because of the adsorption of human serum. Meanwhile, associated with raised serum and particle concentrations, Apolipoprotein E (APOE = gene, apoE = protein) is absorbed in the surface of nanosized magnetic particles besides serum albumin (HAS) and transferrin (TF). But there existed no conspicuous primary-secondary structural developments noticed in serum proteins by various approaches, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and circular dichroism (CDS). Hemolysis evaluation offers nearly no hemolysis at the approved concentrations (up to 1 mg/mL) for nanosized magnetic particles compared with the sodium dodecyl sulfate (positive control). Moreover, the developed internalization and uptake of magnetic nanoparticles through the C4-2B cell line appears to have been confirmed during incubation with human serum (HS). Following the adsorption of serum protein to the surface of nanosized magnetic particles, the immediate proximity within T1 (~1.33-1.73 s) and T2(~12.35-13.43 ms) times of relaxation permitted nanosized magnetic particles to maintain intrinsic magnetic resonance imaging potential even after adsorption of biomolecular protein. All high-level clinical parameters could dictate the translation to clinical practice and the use of this formulation for next-generation nanoscience for drug delivery (DD), cancer targeting, imaging, and theranostics applications [107].",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona interaction with membrane and fusion pore formation followed by detachment from the membrane for sufficiently low ligand densities. Nanoparticles are considered rigid spheres and ligands are considered pH independent. The last condition guarantees that the number of bonds and receptors that is at the end of endocytosis is the same as the number that is at the beginning of exocytosis.

            "text": "Nonetheless, the surface chemistry was observed to outweigh the impact of size on the observed PSNP cellular associations with the sulfone functionalized PNPSs being higher associated to the cells than the carbonyl functionalized nanoparticles. Reported differences in NP uptake thus not always reflect differences in biological processes, but merely the physiochemical interaction of NPs with the exposure media. The type of surface functionalization on NPs was found earlier to be one of the major factors determining adhesions, uptake, transport, and distribution of NPs, which appears to be mainly driven by the size of the protein corona [9,46]. Here, we extended our previous semi-quantitative protein corona analysis using SDS-PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S1) with a quantitative proteomic analysis using label-free LC-MS/MS, as described by [14]. As previously, and commonly, done, the present study was performed in the presence of fetal  [45]. The proteomic analysis showed that the protein corona isolated from the PSNPs was composed of 172 different proteins. We observed an enrichment of proteins involved in binding, apolipoproteins, and acute phase proteins' groups and a less pronounced enrichment of complement factors proteins group. Among these proteins, the alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) protein was most abundantly present on all types of NPs, but the function of this protein is currently unknown. In other studies apolipoproteins have been identified as a dominant protein group in NP protein coronas [47][48][49]. Comparing the protein corona composition among the PSNPs studied here, it was found that A2M, AFP, APOA2, APOH and HBB proteins were significantly less absorbed on the (-SM) functionalized PSNPs Strikingly, the cellular association and transport across a monolayer of Caco-2 cells of these (-SM) functionalized PSNPs was also significantly different compared to the carboxylated PSNPs. Two studies have successfully attempted to correlate the composition of the protein composition of the nanoparticle corona with cellular interaction [50,51].",

            "text": "Another important feature of the biological environment is that the nanoparticles, while exposed to biological fluids, such as blood, lymph, gastric juice, etc., are covered with a kind of \"corona\"-a layer of proteins that are constantly adsorbed on their surface [64]. Undoubtedly, this protein (biological macromolecule) can mask several physicochemical properties (such as the surface charge and solubility) of nanoparticles and make them recognizable to the immune system, which may neutralize them before they reach the target site [65]. The covering of nanoparticles with these proteins largely determines their biological identities and further fate-their distribution through tissues and organs, their rate of excretion from the body, and their opsonization (phagocytosis involving membrane receptors). This is the key factor causing differences in the performance of nanoparticles within in vitro and in vivo [66] studies, where nanoparticles indicate good results in the first case and usually are worse or non-effective in living organisms [67,68]. \n\nHowever, the composition, density, and mechanism of formation of this macromolecular layer depends not only on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles, association/dissociation constants, competitive binding processes, and species of proteins in the biological medium but also on where the nanoparticle is located [69,70]. \n\nThe formation of this protein corona depends not only on the composition of the nanoparticle-its size, shape, surface state, and exposure time-but also on the type of media, the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio, and the presence of ions and other molecular species that interfere in the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles [71]. \n\nCareful modulation of the protein corona through the tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters may allow nanoparticles to be delivered optimally in tumor tissue [72].",

            "text": "Therefore, understanding the in vivo properties and biodistribution of both drugs and nanocarriers is critical to facilitate the development of nanoparticle-loaded DMNs. \n\nAmong all drug modalities, small molecules are usually low-molecular-weight compounds with a defined chemical structure [89]. They exhibit specificity depending on the chemical structures and the targets they interact with in vivo. When small molecules are absorbed in the blood, they are distributed through the body's circulation to various organs and tissues, where they interact with cellular components. Small molecules tend to have a shorter half-life and are easily metabolized by the body, thus limiting their duration in the body [90]. To explore their in vivo fate, Li et al. developed clearing-assisted tissue click chemistry (CATCH) to optically image covalent drug targets in intact mammalian tissues. This study provided a valuable platform for visualizing the in vivo interactions of Regarding nanocarriers, a thorough investigation into the myriad factors influencing in vivo fates is imperative. It has been reported that the protein corona is an important factor affecting the interaction between nanoparticles and organisms and the in vivo delivery process. The nature of nanoparticles themselves and the environment of the organism can regulate the in vivo delivery process of nanoparticles by influencing the composition of protein coronas [97]. Therefore, paying attention to protein coronas in the in vivo fate studies is necessary. In addition, the size of the nanoparticles was found to determine their elimination and targeting. Du et al. provided a systematic summary of the size-scale laws governing the transport of nanoparticles in the human body and how size-dependent transport can be used to address the main challenges in translational nanomedicine [98]. Furthermore, the shape, hardness [99], surface charge, and surface hydrophilicity of nanoparticles could influence their clearance and translocation [100], which are also worth investigating.",

This research aimed to measure and understand protein enrichment on the surface of different silver NPs. More than 500 proteins were identified and isolated that were directly related to the corona formation among which 50% would be found on the NPs regardless of their surface coating or size. The studies with BSA indicated that NPs could be strongly affected by the presence of polymer coatings and the surface charge of the nanoparticles. In some cases, BSA exhibits a relatively low affinity for the electrostatically stabilized NPs, demonstrating the importance of interactions between electrostatic and hydrophobic elements in the protein corona formation. This affinity and electrostatic stabilization mainly controls the toxicological aspects of nanoparticles and thus the corona itself. In addition, uncoated and surfactantfree Ag-NPs promoted a maximum protein (BSA) coating due to increased changes in entropy and a lower affinity for electrostatically stabilized NPs due to the constrained entropy changes. The studies with FBS indicated that, in a protein-free solution, hard protein corona could be sustained in their final form for a long time, undergoing a stabilization process. A typical nanoparticle protein corona consisting of HSA, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, apolipoproteins, transferrin, complement proteins, and hemoglobin causes certain illnesses to develop and progress. In an HSA study, it was found that the interaction of protein coronas with lipid vesicles could enhance their fluidity. Usually, cellular uptake is reduced by the incubation of silver with albumin, which significantly alters the association of the particle with the membrane. The biological activities of the surface corona were also studied to understand their antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. It is evident from the literature that the antibacterial activity of Ag-NPs mostly depends on the capping agents and",

Furthermore, positive but not negative regulation of blood coagulation and regulation of fibrinolysis were also more prominently associated with the CSNPs. \n\nOne of the main findings in the present study is that the composition of the plasma protein corona on SPIONs depends on their surface coating. In line with this conclusion, recent studies focusing on three different carboxylic coating agents, citric acid, poly(acrylic acid), and oleic acid, also showed that differences in surface coating shape the protein corona composition of SPIONs [28]. Interestingly, in a very recent study, polyvinyl alcohol polymer (PVA)-coated SPIONs with negative and neutral surface charge adsorbed more serum proteins than dextrancoated SPIONs, which resulted in a longer blood circulation time in a rat model for the PVAcoated nanoparticles [29]. However, further studies are warranted in order to determine whether specific proteins may impact on the biodistribution of SPIONs or whether the adsorbed protein layer per se, irrespective of the identity of the individual proteins, serves to modify the behavior of the nanoparticles, for instance by affecting their agglomeration or surface charge. Ehrenberg et al. [30] provided evidence, using polystyrene nanoparticles and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, that cellular association is not dependent on the identity of adsorbed proteins and therefore unlikely to require specific binding to any particular cellular receptors. In line with these observations, Simberg et al. [31] concluded that candidate opsonins that had been identified in the corona of dextran-coated SPIONs did not play a significant role in the in vivo clearance of these particles. In fact, it has been stated that \"there is no general rule that could be applied to every type of nanomaterial to predict the outcome [in terms of immune recognition]\" [32].",

            "text": "The transformation of a particle's initial, synthetic reactivity to biological activity after interactions with proteins in a biological environment was brought to the forefront by Walkey et al. [61]. Blood plasma contains~3700 different proteins [62,63], which are present at concentrations up to 60-80 g/l [64]. There are ample opportunities for a wide variety of protein-nanoparticle interactions, and the consequences of these interactions are far reaching. First, surface proteins may either increase the nanoparticle solubility or decrease it, thereby altering bioavailability. Second, they may impact cellular or system functions (i.e., immune system) and alter a myriad of cellular signaling cascades [65]. Third, protein-nanoparticle interactions may alter the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticle relative to the reaction profiles reported in cell-free systems [59,60]. The importance of the biological consequences of protein adsorption cannot be overstated, and the interactions of metal oxide NPs with proteins are central in understanding chemical and biological activity at the bio-nano interface. Finally, the biological identity of each nanoparticle is dynamic and evolves as the nanoparticle encounters different proteins in diverse cellular environments en route to its biological targets. Each biological environment that a particle enters and leaves generates a lasting protein \"fingerprint\" reflective of the path of the nanoparticle to its destination. The serum protein fingerprint depends primarily on the size and composition of the particle, and specific fingerprints may exist for each type of NP [61,66]. The route of administration (intravenous, sub-cutaneous, oral,) will also affect the composition of the proteins adsorbed to the particle.\n\nThe biological responses to a nanoparticle following assimilation are largely defined by the dynamic nature of the protein corona around the nanoparticle and the cellular uptake process that identify the protein-NP complex [67,68]. Approximately 95% of nanomaterials that are delivered to the blood are bound by elements of the complement cascade, are rapidly sequestered by reticuloendothelial organs (i.e., spleen and liver), and never reach their intended targets [69][70][71], unless the liver or",

            "text": "Proteins are essential components in biomolecular corona formation, although sugars and lipids also play important roles [52]. Nanoparticles covered by biomolecular corona exhibit altered physiochemical and functional characteristics which give them new biological identities [53]. The proteins surrounding nanoparticles can either mitigate or stimulate immune responses, or alternatively they may induce pathological and physiological changes [54]. Protein corona is considered to be a major factor that limits nanoparticle-targeted delivery, as it reduces the targeting capability in vivo [55]. Several strategies have been developed to mitigate the effects of biological fluids including blood nanoparticle's functionality. For example, func-tionalizing copper sulphide NPs with the glycan-binding protein jacalin reduces protein corona interference and enhances the targeting ability of the NP via microbial cell surface glycan recognition. This results in substantially higher antimicrobial activity compared to pristine nanoparticles [56]. \n\nNanoparticle-based targeted antimicrobial therapies use a range of delivery systems based on metals, liposomes or lipids, mesoporous silica materials or polymers [57][58][59][60]. Antibacterial-targeted nanoparticles may possess inherent antimicrobial activities, or they may carry therapeutic payloads such as antibiotics [61]. The cell envelope surrounding bacteria acts as a physical barrier, which prevents the accumulation and internalization of antibiotic molecules within bacteria [61]. Silica NPs containing gluconamide-targeting moieties have improved binding affinity to Gram-negative bacteria cell membranes [62]. Therefore, the use of nanoparticles for targeted antimicrobial therapies offers a promising solution to targeted therapies, although substantially more work is required in this field to further refine the nanoparticle therapies.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

            "text": "Our results indicated that the composition of protein corona formed on PEG-PLA nanoparticles varied under different loading and multiple dosing condition. The specific corona composition we found can affect the cellular uptake and, as a result, nanoparticles can be internalized via different mechanisms when adsorbed with different protein coronas. This could subsequently affect the brain delivery and microglia targeting efficiency of nanoparticles. \n\nMany studies have shown that the adsorbed opsonins (such as complement proteins and immunoglobulins) can interact with immune cells via membrane receptors and subsequently induce phagocytosis of the nanoparticles 6,45,56 . Despite that PEGylation can reduce the binding of plasma proteins 24 , our studies demonstrate that complement proteins and immunoglobulins are enriched in the corona of nanoparticles incubated with 7d-plasma. We found that both complement activation and Fcg receptormediate phagocytosis are involved in the internalization of nanoparticles in b.End3 cells, which may contribute to the process of crossing BBB. Moreover, complement activation is related to the internalization of nanoparticles in BV-2 cells, which may contribute to accessing microglia. However, repeated injection of PEGylated nanopharmaceuticals may also lead to unexpected immune-mediated side effects such as allergic responses, due to anti-PEG antibodies triggered complement activation 6,57 . Thus, a balance between their side effects and the benefit of targeting is necessary to be considered in engineering the nano-surface of drug delivery systems. \n\nAdditionally, our results show that RAB5A and CD36 in the corona can enhance the cellular uptake of aM-loaded nanoparticles in both b.End3 and BV-2 cells. RAB5A has been reported to be associated with the fusion of plasma membranes and early endosomes 38 . It is the major regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis 58,59 , which may be the pathway involved in nanoparticles uptake. CD36 is a kind of integral proteins expressed on the membrane of macrophages, endothelial and microglial cells.",

            "text": "After intravenous administration, nanocarriers are exposed to a several sequential hurdles that must be overcome in order to efficiently reach therapeutic levels of drugs at disease sites, avoiding nonspecific uptake in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). As per the literature, when nanocarriers are intravenously administered, they can interact with thousands of proteins. Biological media consists of numerous active biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and blood plasma contains roughly 3,700 identified proteins (Lazarovits et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2017). Protein corona effect i.e. due to the presence of charge on nanocarriers can result into interaction with oppositely charged serum protein. Thus, nanocarriers or the targeting moiety decorated over nanocarriers get buried in protein corona resulting into prevention of nanocarriers's interaction with the targeted receptor in cancer cells (Tonigold et al., 2018). Opsonins are key proteins in the blood serum that promotes elimination of vulnerable nanocarriers by marking them off for an immune response. The major part of opsonized nanocarriers are cleared within seconds by a receptor-mediated mechanism because of the phagocytic cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen of the mononuclear phagocyte system, contributing to nonspecific distribution of nanocarriers in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). \n\nOne most established strategy to mitigate the effect of protein corona involves the nanocarrier functionalization with amphiphilic or hydrophilic polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) (Bros et al., 2018). PEG forms strong adhered hydration layer, which sterically avoid the interaction/adsorption of serum protein (Huo et al., 2019). PEG-decorated nanocarrriers reduce their recognition by the components of the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing their blood circulation time (Xiong et al., 2009;Naeye et al., 2010).",

            "text": "It has been well known that the biomolecular corona formed on particles upon contact with cell culture medium in vitro or human plasma in vivo plays a critical role in the efficacy of nanomedicines [1,2]. The formation of protein corona can impact the biological processes of NMs, such as long circulation time, biodistribution, immune cell activation, cytotoxicity, specific cellular uptake, targeting efficiency, and more [3]. For instance, the opsonin proteins in the biomolecular corona, including immunoglobulins and complement proteins, facilitate phagocytic recognition, leading to sequestration and reduced bioavailability of the NMs [4]. To ensure the efficacy and safety of nanomedicine, various strategies have been developed [5,6] to limit the non-specific protein adsorption on NMs, such as stealth surface modification on NMs with hydrophilic or zwitterionic polymers such as antifouling polyethylene glycol, poly(phosphoester) (PPE), zwitterionic poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PEEP), poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), etc. [5][6][7][8]. However, it has been demonstrated that even with antifouling polymer coatings, the non-specific protein adsorption on the surface of NMs is inevitable [9]. Recent studies have shown that precoating using endogenous biomolecules, such as albumin, clusterin, and fibrinogen, has emerged as a promising strategy [10,11]. Preformed albumin-Au nanorod complexes have been demonstrated to reduce cytotoxicity and macrophage uptake, promote biostability and long circulation time, and enhance tumor targeting and penetration [12]. The specific protein coating on the surface of NMs will influence their cellular uptake and modify the interaction among NMs themselves, which ultimately affects their intracellular fate and in vivo biodistribution.",

            "text": "cells, PEG coating reduced the cytotoxicity for NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) while in RAW 264.7 it had no effect.\n\nproteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29]. As shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa chain C region) showed that PEGylation reduced the content of the apolipoprotein and has an enriched amount of albumin in the surface compared with NP-DMSA ( Figure 6). Proteins like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins are considered opsonins that promote clearance of NPs via interaction with macrophage receptors [71]. In contrast, the enrichment in dysopsonins proteins like albumin promote prolonged",

            "text": "This was discussed by Liu et al. using small CeO 2 -particles and bovine serum albumin with similar size of 7 nm [36]. The smaller surface free energy of particles <10 nm is more and more balanced by shear forces due to Brownian motion with the consequence of detachment of proteins. The authors explained their finding with a heteroaggregation model in which a low number of SPIOs is stabilized between layers of proteins. In our FPLC study we do not see such large protein-SPIO-aggregates with our larger particle. In striking contrast to our findings, Jansch et al. incubated smaller USPIOs with plasma proteins and found no albumin in the corona and excluded a \"Vroman effect\" in their setting [37]. It therefore looks like that the protein corona formation of a given nanoparticle is not simply predictable and depends on the individual properties of the respective particles. \n\nIn our pilot study in vivo, we could measure an almost quantitative uptake of the preformed adsorbed transferrin corona into the liver and spleen presumably by professional phagocytes such as Kupffer cells in the liver. We found earlier by electron microscopy of murine liver tissues after i.v. injection of the polymer coated SPIO that these monodisperse iron cores are present in endosomal structures of Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [38]. These negative charged SPIOs had no preformed transferrin corona but must have been also coated by plasma proteins before liver uptake took place implicating a similar biodistribution. This confirms the stability of a corona in a recent study by Wang et al. using a cell culture model [22].",

            "text": "The low variety in protein sizes in digestion coronas compared to the serum corona has previously been reported for 50 nm neutral, carboxylated and aminated polystyrene nanoplastics [24]. \n\nThe reduced presence of serum proteins in the corona of digested+serum-coated MNPs indicates that the prior presence of digestion proteins impaired subsequent incorporation of serum proteins into the corona of all tested MNPs. Such a shielding effect of a preexisting protein corona has previously been applied to reduce blood clearance of targeted mesoporous silica by phagocytes [62]. The presence of a protein corona is known to reduce nonspecific interactions with the cellular membrane, which in turn reduces nonreceptor-mediated uptake [63], and studies have reported an inverse correlation between the amount of MNP-bound protein and cellular uptake [63,64]. The reduced amount of protein bound to the digested+serum-coated PS MNPs may therefore contribute to their higher internalization compared to serum-coated PS MNPs. The larger MNPs showed a less pronounced difference in protein abundance in their corona between serum-coated and digested+serumcoated conditions, which may explain the similar cellular uptake between the different treatments of PS500 and PS1000 MNPs. Previously it has been shown that particle surface curvature can induce protein denaturation which stimulates uptake through misfolded protein receptor mediated endocytosis [21,65,66]. The surface curvature is inversely proportional to the squared radius of a sphere and thus larger protein denaturation is expected for small MNPs compared to large MNPs. Additionally it was shown that increased misfolding of coronated proteins was related to increased cytotoxicity in isolated blood cells, highlighting the importance of this effect [67]. Future studies assessing protein denaturation on in vitro digested MNPs and whether this causes increased recognition by misfolded protein receptors may help elucidate this effect. \n\nTo investigate whether specific proteins may drive the effect of in vitro digestion on cellular uptake, the protein corona composition was characterized in detail using LC-MS-MS-based proteomics.",

            "text": "When a nanomaterial is exposed to biological fluids, layers of proteins and/or biomolecules can form around it, known as the protein corona, which has a substantial influence on various biological processes, such as biodistribution, particle stability, and immune system recognition [57]. The particle size, NLC composition, and surface charge can affect the type and quantity of protein attracted [58]. \n\nSurface modification of nanoparticles can influence the type of protein corona formed. For example, functionalization with stealth materials like PEG can minimize protein adsorption, thereby reducing opsonization and prolonging circulation time in the bloodstream [58]. Moreover, if system destabilization does not occur, the formation of a protein corona should not be considered entirely detrimental, as tumor cells tend to overexpress albumin receptors such as gp60. This can assist in better targeting of coated particles to the target tissue, greater accumulation in the tumor microenvironment, increased cellular uptake, and improved therapeutic efficacy [59]. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 9, the variations in particle size and zeta potential following protein corona formation were assessed based on albumin concentration and incubation time. Figure 9A,B depict the immediate changes in particle size and zeta potential, respectively, across all formulations at different albumin concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL) after incubation. In contrast, Figure 9C,D present the temporal changes in particle size and zeta potential, respectively, for all formulations at a fixed BSA concentration of 5 mg/mL. It is important to note that oNLC-Chi was not included in the analysis due to the previously discussed destabilization. \n\nWhen incubated at varying albumin concentrations, the particle size remained relatively stable across the majority of formulations, except for oNLC-Plu, which showed an increase in size, resulting in destabilization and increased PdI at all BSA concentrations (357 to 469 nm) (Figure 9A). This can be attributed to albumin molecules adsorbing onto the nanoparticle surface according to their levels of hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge [60], increasing in particle size as protein molecules occupy available space on the surface.",

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

            "text": "When a nanomaterial is exposed to biological fluids, layers of proteins and/or biomolecules can form around it, known as the protein corona, which has a substantial influence on various biological processes, such as biodistribution, particle stability, and immune system recognition [57]. The particle size, NLC composition, and surface charge can affect the type and quantity of protein attracted [58]. \n\nSurface modification of nanoparticles can influence the type of protein corona formed. For example, functionalization with stealth materials like PEG can minimize protein adsorption, thereby reducing opsonization and prolonging circulation time in the bloodstream [58]. Moreover, if system destabilization does not occur, the formation of a protein corona should not be considered entirely detrimental, as tumor cells tend to overexpress albumin receptors such as gp60. This can assist in better targeting of coated particles to the target tissue, greater accumulation in the tumor microenvironment, increased cellular uptake, and improved therapeutic efficacy [59]. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 9, the variations in particle size and zeta potential following protein corona formation were assessed based on albumin concentration and incubation time. Figure 9A,B depict the immediate changes in particle size and zeta potential, respectively, across all formulations at different albumin concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL) after incubation. In contrast, Figure 9C,D present the temporal changes in particle size and zeta potential, respectively, for all formulations at a fixed BSA concentration of 5 mg/mL. It is important to note that oNLC-Chi was not included in the analysis due to the previously discussed destabilization. When incubated at varying albumin concentrations, the particle size remained relatively stable across the majority of formulations, except for oNLC-Plu, which showed an increase in size, resulting in destabilization and increased PdI at all BSA concentrations (357 to 469 nm) (Figure 9A). This can be attributed to albumin molecules adsorbing onto the nanoparticle surface according to their levels of hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge [60], increasing in particle size as protein molecules occupy available space on the surface.",

Deng et al. 25 showed that poly(acrylic acid)-coated gold nanoparticles bind fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clot formation, in a charge-dependent manner, inducing unfolding of the protein, and that binding to integrin receptors on the surface of the monocytic cell line, THP-1 leads to activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 . However, recent studies suggested clever ways in which to circumvent this problem 31,32 .",

            "text": "To achieve ideal nanomedicine design with better targeting efficiency, it is of great importance to first understand the interactions between nano-sized materials and living organisms at the cellular and molecular levels. In the presence of a biological fluid, nanoparticles are covered by a bimolecular corona which could potentially determine many of those interactions. It is now widely acknowledged that many key processes are driven by initial recognition of this adsorbed layer by cell receptors. Thus, the corona can affect receptor-mediated outcomes such as nanoparticle targeting, biodistribution, ability to cross biological barriers, and intracellular trafficking. The latest findings on the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors discussed in this review provide a deeper understanding of the complexity of this very first step in nanoparticle-cell interactions and its implications for the following outcomes at cell level. All these recent works showed that a combination of the knowledge of biomolecular corona composition, how these components are organized and presented, and which and how many receptors interact with this adsorbed layer are all critical aspects to be considered when designing targeted drug carriers. Thus, with the benefits and limitations offered by the discussed methods, better insights could be achieved by, for instance, combining some of them on the same system. At the same time, the biomolecular corona itself can be used as a tool to discover potential ligands as well as receptors involved in nanoparticle uptake in specific cell types to be used for novel targeting strategies (Walkey et al., 2014;Liu et al., 2015;Ritz et al., 2015;Yin et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020). Indeed, many more aspects are yet still to be disentangled, for instance, how other physiological factors such as flow and shear stress (in blood) influence not only the biomolecular corona composition, but also the resulting interactions with cell receptors. To this end, systematic and reproducible tools must be developed that include a more physiological platform to mimic in vivo conditions, while allowing a comprehensive characterization of the biomolecular corona, and investigation of the corresponding biological interactions. We believe that further developments in this direction will help to provide valuable insights and opportunities for accelerating the bench-to bed translation of nanomedicine.",

The active targeting of drugs has been used for cationized albumin (Pardridge et al., 1987;Kumagai et al., 1987) and evaluated in isolated brain capillaries and in rat brain. In comparison with native protein, it was noted that there was an enhanced uptake of positively charged albumin by the brain capillaries. In vivo studies in rats on cationized albumin transport through the BBB were also carried out . About 15% of the cationized protein detected in the whole brain was located in the post-capillary extracellular space. Cationization was shown to improve the accumulation of the protein in brain tissues . Cationized heterologous proteins have more immunogenic properties than homologous proteins (Muckerheide et al., 1987). In another study, it was demonstrated that the beta-endorphin, a non-transportable chimeric peptide, when covalently coupled to cationized albumin was able to reach the cerebral parenchyma . Cationized bovin serum albumin (CBSA) has been conjugated to pegylated liposomes and these liposomes were specifically taken up when in contact with isolated brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) and a monolayer of porcine BCEC (Thole et al., 2002). These results showed the ability of CBSA nanoparticles to pass through the BBB to reach the cerebral parenchyma. The coating of nanoparticles using hydrophilic surfactants has proved promising for the delivery of drugs to the brain. However, their targeted effect depends on the chemical structure, physicochemical and biochemical parameters of the surfactant. Only a few polysorbates have been reported to interact with the brain endothelium (Kreuter et al., 1997). Another approach uses the adsorption of plasma proteins such as apolipoproteins (apo) on the surface of coated nanoparticles after intravenous administration. Because apoE is involved in the transport of low-density lipoprotein to the brain nanocarriers coated with polysorbate mimic LDL after apoE adsorption. This protein is expressed",

            "text": "The formation of a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface can be regulated by modifying the nanoparticle surface with zwitterions, polyethylene glycol (PEG), carbohydrate moieties, and dysopsonic proteins, which can enhance the colloidal stability and prolong the circulation time in blood by enabling escape from MPS clearance [14][15][16][17] . However, these strategies are still limited at conferring targeting specificity since an additional targeting ligand increases the propensity for protein corona formation to mask the targeting ability and inhibit the biological effects of nanoparticles [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . This can explain why many nanoparticles with active targeting systems have failed in clinical trials 25 . Therefore, to design nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents, there is a considerable need to regulate protein corona formation on nanoparticles [26][27][28] and to obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in regulating nanoparticle-biological interactions. Here, we present a targeting system in which nanoparticles are supramolecularly precoated with a protein corona shield (PCS) that reduce serum protein absorption while retaining targeting specificity (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

After pre-incubation with serum, peptide-modified nanoparticles had minimal increases in hydrodynamic diameter, a slight negative shift in zeta potential, and less interaction with Rose Bengal compared to their characterization in PBS (Figure 2d, e, f). PEGmodified nanoparticle surfaces have been shown to sterically hinder protein adsorption by repelling attachment with a hydrated shell that is formed in contact with biological fluids, leading to the formation of a minimal protein corona (46,47).

            "text": "This study addresses several parameters which are often neglected when analyzing interactions of nanocarriers, proteins and cells, such as protein concentration, protein source, different anticoagulants and cell type. Our results reveal important differences for the protein corona formation and NP uptake dependent on the protein source, emphasizing that the formation of different bionanostructures exerts different biological effects. \n\nThe results presented indicate that, in general, proteins attenuate the uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles into cells. Related results have been reported by Lesniak et al., showing a reduced uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles when proteins are present in the cell culture medium. 17 Furthermore, we show that the concentration of the protein source has deep implications on particle uptake. Serum and plasma concentrations as low as 0.5% already have a major impact by strongly reducing the internalization of an amino-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticle into HeLa cells. This should be taken into  account in all experiments investigating cellular uptake of nanocarriers. In order to adjust in vitro experiments to be as close as possible to in vivo conditions, it should be considered to use 100% of the respective protein source as this is the natural concentration in vivo. However, no large discrepancies between 10%, the concentration most commonly used for cell culture experiments, and 100% were observed for particle cell interactions. \n\nMost importantly, it was demonstrated that the choice of the protein source is crucial for nanoparticle uptake analysis. Many recent studies of great importance investigating the different aspects of the protein corona of nanocarriers employed different protein sources as FBS, 17,18 human serum, 19,20 human citrate 3,21 or EDTA plasma 2,22 without further stating reasons for their choice. The results shown here emphasize the necessity of a careful decision concerning the protein source as the outcome of experiments is strongly dependent on it. \n\nHard corona protein profiles varied significantly between the investigated protein sources: FBS, human serum, human heparin and citrate plasma. A strong difference in corona composition was especially prominent between the human and bovine media. As FBS is the most frequently used supplement for many cells cultured in vitro, it is also often employed in protein corona studies.",

            "text": "Circulating proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface of liposomes, forming a protein corona that is the interface for biological interactions (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016). The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Proteins and other biomolecules play an important role in regulating the interactions between nanomaterials and macrophages. Plasma is the most important biological medium, in which the total plasma protein concentration is about 60-80 g/L. 21 When the nanomedicine enters into the blood vessel for about 30s, it adsorbs a large amount of proteins on its surface and forms a biocrown. 22 The composition of the biocrown significantly affects the in vivo biological properties of the carrier. First, the binding mode of nanodrugs to plasma proteins is a key factor affecting their recognition by macrophages. It has been shown that adsorption of non-modulin proteins such as serum albumin and apolipoprotein J (Apo J) reduces the carrier-cell membrane interaction and macrophage uptake, and incubation with serum albumin significantly inhibits uptake by dendritic cells. 23 On the contrary, when more conditioning agents, such as complement and immunoglobulin, were adsorbed on the carrier surface, phagocytes could rapidly recognize the nanomedicine, which in turn accelerated its clearance. Secondly, the adsorbed protein crowns can significantly affect the targeting of nanocarriers such as liposomes, eg, Guan et al showed that liposomes modified with cation-rich peptides adsorbed higher amounts of IgG and IgM, which inhibited the targeting of the formulations and enhanced the interaction with immune cells. 24 Therefore, reducing the content of protein crowns or adjusting the adsorbed species can effectively regulate the interaction between carriers and macrophages. 6][27] PEG, as a hydrophilic long-chain polymer, effectively reduces protein adsorption on the surface of nanocarriers. 28 Increasing the density of PEG on gold nanoparticles was shown to significantly reduce serum protein adsorption and uptake by macrophages. 29 However, Schottler et al discovered that the adsorption of a specific quantity of serum proteins could actually enhance the carrier's ability to inhibit macrophage uptake. 30 This finding introduces complexity and raises questions about how protein corona formation influences long-circulation properties. In addition to PEG modification, biomimetic modifications have gained attention.",

            "text": "Opsonization (i.e., corona formation) with mouse serum increased uptake of negatively charged micelles but decreased uptake of positive micelles. \n\nRegardless of specific nanoparticle composition or molecular targeting, the EPR effect is likely to be responsible for the initial distribution of PBN to pathological tissues due to the permeability effects of inflammation on vascular barrier function in most pathologies [107][108][109]. Of course, one caveat is that some pathologies may not exhibit prominent EPR effects, such as genetic neurological diseases that retain a relatively intact bloodbrain barrier. However, in inflammatory pathologies such as cancer, immature and leaky angiogenic neovasculature has been identified as the quintessential condition for the EPR effect. In other pathologies such as atherosclerosis, advanced lipid and macrophage-laden plaques are highly inflammatory, and local vascular barrier function is disrupted [110,111]. Glycocalyx deterioration [112], relaxation of adherens and/or tight junctions [108], and even late-stage endothelial death and sloughing [113] permit ready penetration of 200-250 nm or larger particles for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [110,[114][115][116][117]. \n\nDespite potential opportunities for EPR-based delivery, local extrahepatic deposition depends in part on the specifics of nanoparticle multicompartmental pharmacokinetics that avoid early sequestration by the RES to permit sufficient deposition in non-hepatic sites primed for EPR. Interest in manipulation of nanoparticle corona formation has emerged as one approach to channel extrahepatic compartmentalization [118,119]. Baimanov et al. recently have elucidated the in-situ dynamics of multilayered corona formation on small copper sulphate nanoparticles [120]. They identified an initial \"hard corona \"that avidly binds serum proteins to the nanoparticle surface, which is followed by envelopment of a lower affinity bound \"soft corona \"based on protein-protein interactions. These layers may remodel over time as continuous adsorption, exchange, and rearrangement of corona composition.",

About 300 different proteins were identified in both samples, with the 15 most abundant ones contributing alone to roughly 36% (HC) and 50% (LC) of the total proteins recovered. As already observed for similar studies, although most of the proteins were present in both coronas, the relative abundance of some of them was very different between the two samples. For instance, while apolipoprotein B-100 content was comparable in the two cases, the histidine-rich glycoprotein was particularly enriched in the corona formed at high serum amount, and vice versa apolipoprotein A-I content was much higher in the corona formed in low serum.\n\nNanoparticle Uptake Efficiency in Situ and after Corona Isolation.

            "text": "In recent years, nanocarriers have been employed for targeted drug delivery. Biomolecular corona formation is the first event nanocarriers experience upon entering into the bloodstream and coming into contact with its components. The rapidly forming corona consists of proteins, but also of sugars, lipids, and other components of the plasma.\n\nThe biomolecular corona formed on the surface of nanocarriers confers them a unique identity, which later determines their biological fate within the body, such as cellular uptake, biodistribution, retention, and clearance. 1,2 The clearance of nanocarriers from the body is usually carried out by scavenging the activity of immune system cells, such as macrophages. Thus, one of the strategies towards targeted drug delivery is to make nanocarriers \"invisible\" to the immune system, a phenomenon also known as the stealth effect. This will allow nanocarriers to circulate in the bloodstream for an extended period of time and to reach their target. 3 Studies demonstrated that surface functionalization of nanocarriers (e.g. attachment of polyethylene glycol or PEGylation), and the appearance of certain proteins in the corona result in an increased stealth effect. 4 Sch\u00f6ttler et al. showed that clusterin confers to the nanoparticles a strong stealth effect. 4 Clusterin (also known as apolipoprotein J) is a 70-80 kDa lipoprotein consisting of two polypeptide chains that are connected by up to 5 disulfide bonds. Seven asparagine residues of clusterin are highly glycosylated and the glycosylic groups add up to ca. 30% of the total protein weight 5 (UniProt Protein Database, Protein ID P10909).\n\nOther major examples of lipoproteins include high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very lowdensity lipoprotein (vLDL) complexes of the blood.

            "text": "Protein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44]. The protein corona on the NP surface is hypothesised to hinder interactions of nanoparticle ligands and the targets on the cell surface [44,47]. \n\nThe study of Mirshafiee et al. [44] found that the protein corona formed on BCN-NPs (NPs functionalized with bicyclononyne) incubated in medium with 10% serum and 100% serum consisted of abundant proteins, such as chain A, a novel allosteric mechanism in haemoglobin, fetuin, haemoglobin foetal subunit beta or apolipoprotein A-II precursor. It was also reported that \u226588% of proteins in BCN-NP coronas had a molecular weight below 30 kDa. Even relatively low molecular weight proteins created corona that significantly reduced NP targeting efficiency [44]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (HiPco\u00ae) were also found to interact with cell culture medium and its components. Casey et al. described that SWCNT interacted with the medium via physisorption through van der Waals forces [26,48]. \n\nThe process of protein corona formation has a decisive influence on nanoparticle-induced toxicity. For example, silica nanoparticles (AmSil30) precoated with human plasma caused lower cell-death induction in primary human endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cell line (ISO-HAS1). The resulting effect was dependent on the time of corona formation. The most significant effect was recorded for the early corona, but prolonged incubation with plasma (>30 min) did not counteract membered toxicity [49]. In another example, thrombocytes were used to study the protein corona effect on the biological model. In the latter study, nanoparticles exposed to human plasma for 0.5 min did not activate thrombocytes to form aggregates due to the presence of the plasma protein corona [49].",

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated that anionic liposomes modified with PEGs could achieve enhanced clearance at the site of subcutaneous administration and increased retention in the lymph nodes when compared to liposomes that were not modified. Liposomes modified with shorter PEG chains exhibited higher retention but lower clearance in the lymph nodes compared to liposomes modified with longer PEG chains. Therefore, the targeting behavior and transfection capability of LNPs can be significantly influenced by the selection of a linear or branched PEG chain [110]. In addition to passive cellular uptake and prolonged circulation, nanoparticle uptake into target cells can be improved by attaching a receptor ligand to the particle surface. Enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells can be achieved through methods other than relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake, such as utilizing a receptor ligand that is conjugated to the particle surface. The incorporation of targeting ligands into lipid-based nanoparticles is a strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems to specific tissues or cells, including the lymph nodes and other desired locations. The ASSET platform (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting) was developed through the conjugation of anti-Ly6C antibodies onto lipid-based nanoparticles that were loaded with siRNA, which selectively targets inflammatory leukocytes in vivo [111,112]. Cell-penetrating peptides have demonstrated their effectiveness in facilitating the intracellular delivery of a diverse range of pharmacologically interesting molecules across various types of cells and show promise in enhancing the intracellular delivery of a wide array of biologically active agents [113]. LNPs have been modified with cell-penetrating peptides, such as R8 and GALA, to improve the uptake of these particles in dendritic cells and to enhance the immune response [114]. The exposure of LNPs to biological fluids causes the biomolecules to be rapidly adsorbed onto their surface, generating the protein corona. Initially, the protein corona comprises significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment. As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115].",

The protein corona of NPs after exposure to the cytosolic fluid was significantly different, but protein pattern in hard corona was retained after plasma incubation, 17 which was in agreement with a previous study. 35 DMEM encouraged higher total protein quantity adsorbed onto gold NPs than RPMI after 48 h incubation, but similar amounts were observed at the 1-h incubation. 18",

            "text": "As mentioned, naturally derived biopolymer-based NPs, specifically protein-based NPs, have many intrinsic characteristics that make them advantageous for targeting certain cell types. For example, they can be both genetically and chemically modified to display cell-targeting ligands on their surface [140]. Depending on the protein, they can be tuned to express a positive or negative surface charge, as cells are slightly negatively charged, and some therapeutics can be ionically bound to the surface of NPs based on charge alone [140]. In vivo, these surface charges will change largely based on the protein corona, which describes the layer of proteins that assemble on the surface of the particle after the introduction of the particle to physiological fluids [141]. This protein layer is governed by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticle, such as surface charge and hydrophobicity, and it greatly impacts how readily the particles are cleared by the immune system; adsorbed immunoglobulins on the particle surface can result in them being cleared by the immune system, for example [141]. Therefore, the protein corona is critical for understanding and controlling cellular uptake and reaching target tissues. \n\nWith protein-based particles, namely SF or SS, surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity can be more readily tuned, allowing for potential control of the protein corona in vivo [140,142,143]. Without characterizing the protein corona, the translation of targeted drug delivery using NPs from bench-to-bedside becomes challenging [144]. The significance of the protein corona varies depending on the target organ or area of the body. Specifically, when considering the skin, the protein corona plays a pivotal role in nanoparticle interactions and responses. \n\nSkin, being the outermost barrier of the body, interacts significantly with external agents. External factors, such as exposure to sunlight, sweat, or environmental pollutants, may alter the composition of the protein corona in nanoparticles applied to the skin. Different skin cell types or skin states (healthy vs. wounded) may respond differently to nanoparticles based on the protein corona, affecting aspects such as inflammation and allergic reactions. Understanding the protein corona's role in cellular interactions helps in designing nanoparticles for effective skin delivery of drugs or therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "Differential centrifugal sedimentation and immunological dot-blot studies revealed that increased serum concentration significantly reduced the binding of Tf-modified NPs to their receptors. They demonstrated that the protein corona significantly reduced the receptor-mediated uptake and internalization of NPs in A549 cells. They clearly indicated a significant disparity between in vivo and in vitro outcomes of NP targeting efficacy in the presence of a protein corona [80]. Su et al. reported that protein corona formation alters the active and passive targeting of cyclic RGD peptides attached on PEGylated NPs. The cellular uptake of NPs with bound proteins was reduced to 26% compared with NPs without bound proteins (ca. 76%). The in vivo results also demonstrated that the targeting efficacy of cyclic RGD peptide-functionalized PEGylated NPs was much smaller when proteins were bound to NPs [81]. Xiao et al. functionalized Tf onto the surface of PEGylated polystyrene NPs to evaluate the effect of the protein corona on blood-brain barrier transcytosis, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking. They demonstrated that Tf-NPs completely lost their targeting ability after in vitro protein corona formation, while the activity was preserved after in vivo protein corona formation [82]. \n\nProtein corona formation on antibody-conjugated NPs can have both negative and beneficial effects. Nayak et al. adsorbed bovine lactoferrin (BLf) onto AgNPs and studied the effect of this protein corona. They observed a higher internalization of BLf-AgNPs than of bare AgNPs, which indicates that the protein corona improved the intracellular efficiency of the NPs. Moreover, the BLf corona also increased the bioavailability of the NPs in THP1 cells and resulted in enhanced humoral immune response. The protein corona formation on Ab-conjugated NPs mediates a more specific and sensitive antibody-antigen interaction [83]. The group of de Puig evaluated the effect of a protein corona on anti-NS1 Ab-conjugated star-shaped gold NPs. They found that the protein corona increased the binding affinity of the NPs to bind to the Zika virus NS1 [84].",

            "text": "Active targeting nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) have been widely exploited as drug cargos for chemotherapy [1] . Among them, various strategies have been developed to functionalize nanoparticles (NPs) with biological ligands, aiming to specifically target to tumor cell receptors [2,3] . Though the ligand-functionalized strategy is effective in vitro , however, the corresponding in vivo targeting efficiency is significantly lessened or even diminished because NPs surface is nonspecifically opsonized by plasma proteins upon intravenous administration [3][4][5] . The formed protein corona mainly consists of high-affinity proteins such as complement components and immunoglobins [6][7][8] , which induces undesired organ distribution and the quick clearance of NPs from the body [5,[9][10][11] . Hydrophilic \"stealth\" polyethylene glycol (PEG) is supposed to prevent NPs from fouling of protein opsonins and extend NPs blood circulation time in vivo [12,13] , nevertheless, the PEG-modification covers the targeting ligands and restrains the ligands to interact with membrane receptors [14,15] , and also triggers the unsatisfied accelerated blood clearance (ABC) after repeated systemic administration [16] . Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a metabolite of artemisinin, is efficient in antimalarial therapy [17] . In vitro , DHA exhibited a certain affinity to albumin or transferrin in an entropy-driven manner when incubation DHA with albumin or transferrin [18,19] . Therefore, we decorated DHA on the surfaces of PLGA-PEG2000-DHA (PPD) NPs and envisioned to prepare albumin or transferrin-enriched corona NPs. Differing from our assumption, we interestingly found that DHA-modified NPs could specifically recruit apolipoprotein (apoE), instead of albumin and transferrin, in their corona evidenced by LC-MS/MS and western blotting, taking bare PLGA-PEG2000 (PP) NPs as a control.",

These unique properties also have significant effects on the composition and structure of the protein corona formed around these NPs in a biological environment. Herein, protein corona formation on albumin NPs and liposomes was simultaneously evaluated through in vitro and simulation studies. The sizes of both types of NPs increased with more negatively charged interfaces upon being introduced into fetal bovine serum. Gel electrophoresis and label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to identify proteins recruited to the hard corona, and fewer proteins were found in albumin NPs than in liposomes, which is in accordance with isothermal titration calorimetry. The cellular uptake efficiency of the two NPs significantly differed in different serum concentrations, which was further scrutinized by loading an anticancer compound into albumin NPs. The presence of the hard protein corona increased the cellular uptake of albumin NPs in comparison with liposomes. In our simulation study, a specific receptor present in the membrane was greatly attracted to the albumin-apolipoprotein E complex. Overall, this study not only evaluated protein corona formation on albumin NPs, but also made promising advancements toward albumin- and liposome-based therapeutic systems.",

            "text": "Generally, nanoparticles formed protein corona in blood owing to the high surface free energy, and it is the protein corona that crucially determined the in vivo fate of nanoparticles (Monopoli et al., 2011). In recent years, protein corona targeting was proposed for nanoparticle delivery, where the surface-modified nanoparticles can specifically bind with special endogenous protein in the bloodstream to realize protein corona-mediated targeting delivery (Yousefpour et al., 2018;Huo et al., 2020). As an iron-mimic cyclic peptide, CRT is able to selectively interact with Tf through a non-canonical allosteric binding mechanism (Staquicini et al., 2011). A comprehensive characterization of the plasma protein corona was performed to compare MMB4@MDZ and CRT-MMB4@MDZ. After 2 h incubation in plasma, a protocol combining membrane ultrafiltration and  high-speed centrifugation was used to isolate the PC-NP complexes. A comprehensive analysis of the protein corona composition was carried out by LC-MS/MS and the 20 most abundant proteins were presented in Table 4. Surprisingly, MMB4@MDZ evolved into a protein corona with Tf being the seventh most-abundant corona protein. This explained the in vivo brain-targeting effect of MMB4@MDZ. On the other hand, Tf is the eighth most-abundant corona protein for CRT-MMB4@MDZ. Protein coronas of nanoparticles have been widely reported to be complex and variable, and Tf was not inevitably included into the top 20 most abundant corona proteins (Aggarwal et al., 2009;Cai & Chen, 2019;Richtering et al., 2020). In this context, CRT-MMB4@MDZ and MMB4@MDZ formed protein coronas with more abundant Tf relative to other types of nanoparticles. Protein corona architecture is a multilayer assembly of proteins that undergo dynamic exchanges with free proteins in vivo (Chen et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2020). Consequently, Tf in the protein corona of CRT-MMB4@MDZ suffered association with other types of proteins and frequent exchanges with serum proteins.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are nanosized structures of 1-100 nm diameter with a high surface area. The ability of NPs to carry cargoes of small molecules to target destinations has made them a popular field of exploration in physical science and medicine in recent years [1]. Along with drug delivery, many recently developed NPs showed promising capabilities of self-reporting and tracking through imaging [2][3][4]. NPs can be lipid-based, carbon-based, polymeric, biomimetic, or inorganic [5]. Therapeutic usage of inorganic NPs is quite challenging as it not only requires functionalisation of NPs with proteins, antibodies, DNA, small molecule drugs but also demands stability and safety in vivo, and toxicity, bioaccumulation and biodistribution of these NPs are still issues to be addressed successfully. \n\nWhen administered to the bloodstream, serum proteins coat the NPs within minutes. The composition of this coating, which does not substantially change over time, may cause changes to the physicochemical properties of the NPs and contribute to their biodistribution, targeting efficiency, uptake by the immune cells, and clearance from the body [6]. Most of the in vitro studies use a lower serum concentration of about 10%, which does not reflect the condition in vivo [7]. Serum concentration may affect the quality and quantity of the protein corona formed around the particles [7]. A study on the impact of 10% and 100% serum concentrations on pure silica and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) showed little impact of the surface chemistry of NPs and incubation time on protein corona compared to that imposed by serum concentration. Adsorption of opsonins such as apolipoproteins increases with serum concentration, which increases the clearance of NPs by the macrophages [7]. Generally, the NP-serum interaction studies use mouse or bovine serum, which is important to take note of as the composition of serum varies among species. A study on polystyrene NPs showed lesser clearance of human serum-coated NPs by macrophages compared to that for the same NP coated with mouse serum [8].",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

Nevertheless, when nanoparticles enter in contact with physiological fluids, the biocorona transforms their surface in their biological identity, meaning that their surface is modified due to the attachment of proteins and other macromolecules from blood and other biological fluids, thus hiding important surface functionalities and hampering their expected biodistribution [12,63]. Moreover, the adsorption of opsonins or other specific proteins might lead to fast clearance from the body. pBAE nanoparticles, as most nanocarriers, include hydrophilic polymers to overcome this common bottleneck step. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is the most extensively used polymer in drug delivery to allow the vectors to circumnavigate biological barriers, decrease the unspecific absorption in non-targeted tissue, and increase the specific cellular uptake [12]. However, PEG can be recognized by the immune system and causes strong allergic reactions in some patients [39,40]. Consequently, extensive work on controlling the formation of the biocorona by tuning the nanoparticle's surface exists in the bibliography. In our first attempts, we worked on tuning nanoparticle surfaces to promote the binding of proteins of interest from the corona. We published this study in 20196, selecting liver targeting as a proof-ofconcept. Being aware that hepatocytes have receptors for the retinol-binding protein (RBD), a protein present in the human serum, we designed a retinol-modified place intending to promote the formation of a corona enriched with RBP. This work demonstrated that we could tune the biodistribution by playing with the protein corona while achieving the envisaged organ targeting. Nevertheless, this strategy is limited to targeting cells with specific affinity proteins in the serum.",

Given the relevance of the protein corona in defining the behavior of the EVs in biofluids, it is crucial to study this process to better understand the in vivo biological effect of the EVs on cells. To assess the lifespan of EVs coated with a protein layer, Liang and colleagues 191 used an AlexaFluor 488conjugated albumin to decorate the surface of EVs that were engineered with a surface marker that express albumin binding domains. With dSTORM, they detected single EVs bound to albumin molecules, reporting a robust binding capacity both in vitro and after in vivo injection. In two other studies, the spontaneous formation of a protein corona around native EVs was observed. In the first, the EVs with anti-tetraspanin fluorescent antibodies were added to a solution of fluorescent (AlexaFluor 647) albumin and imaged with dSTORM 192 . In the second one, colocalizations between vesicle tetraspanins and albumin or VEGF was reported, thus demonstrating the spontaneous formation of a protein corona around native EVs and unravelling with SRM its potential biological role 158 . \n\nRecently, there has been a growing and debated significance attributed to the protein corona within the EV field 193 . SRM has proven effective for studying protein corona, which forms spontaneously and may act as a carrier for growth factors. It can be used to detect specific targets within the EV protein corona. Multi-color SRM approaches can theoretically be applied to explore colocalization between vesicular markers (proteins or lipids) and the target of interest. In addition, using a DNA-PAINT approach could significantly expand the range of potential targets, even if the validation could be challenging. Contrarily to conventional approaches, and more easily than immuno-EM, the strongest potential of SRM lies in the effective locating of specific markers. Thanks to the nanometric resolution and by including appropriate controls, SRM can elucidate if the specific target is within the EV corona, on the lipid surface or within the EVs or even if it should be considered as a contaminant.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, despite their potential, the clinical application of targeted LNPs has encountered hurdles. One prominent obstacle arises from the fact that, under physiological conditions, targeted LNPs become coated with biomolecules, thereby concealing their targeting ligands. \n\nRecent studies explore the gap between laboratory findings and the clinical success of NPs. This gap is partially attributed to our limited understanding of the connection between their synthetic identity, biological identity, and physiological response. 73 Upon in vivo administration (e.g., i.v., subcutaneous injection, etc.) NPs get coated by a protein corona that provides them with a new biological identity that controls physiological response. 74 In previous works, we have shown that the protein corona acquired by lipid vesicles has a composition that is simultaneously regulated by the electrical charge and by the affinity of lipids for individual proteins or specific classes of plasma proteins. 75 The protein corona regulates the interaction with immune system cells in vitro and ex vivo. 76 hese findings prompted us to create biomimetic lipoplexes with an artificial opsonin-deficient protein corona that minimizes the uptake by immune cells in vivo. 16 We have also demonstrated that the protein corona of lipoplexes locks onto receptors of cancer cells, promoting internalization by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It was the case of DOTAP/ DNA lipoplexes coated by a vitronectin-enriched protein corona. We showed that vitronectin promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin receptor. 77 Accurate identification of protein corona fingerprints has allowed us to predict multiple biological interactions between lipid vesicles and cancer cells. \n\nThe development of such knowledge for LNPs will be vital for improved particle design and targeted delivery. Now that we know that the protein corona is the missing link to correlate synthetic identity and physiological response, it will be necessary to investigate the bionano interactions between LNPs and specific biological fluids. \n\nIn this regard, the quantitative structure\u2212activity relationship (QSAR) methods can be used to predict the relationships between the synthetic identity of LNPs and their mechanism of action at a cellular level.",

The surface characteristics of these colloidal particles are determinant for a controlled and directed delivery to target tissues with specific markers. We report the development of immuno-nanocapsules, in which some antibody molecules with different immuno-specificity are conjugated to the nanocapsule surface, offering the standardization of a simple method to obtain vectorized nanosystems with specific recognition properties. Nanocapsules were prepared by a solvent-displacement technique, producing an oily core coated by a functional shell of different biocompatible molecules and surface carboxylic groups. Three different antibodies (one a specific HER2 oncoprotein antibody) were conjugated with these nanoparticles by the carbodiimide method, which allows the covalent immobilization of protein molecules through carboxylic surface groups. The immuno-nanocapsules were completely characterized physico-chemically via electrokinetic and colloidal stability experiments, confirming the correct immobilization of these antibody molecules on the colloidal nanoparticles. Also, additional immunological analyses verified that these IgG-LNC complexes showed the expected specific immuno-response. Finally, different healthy and tumoral breast-cell lines were cultured in vitro with Nile-Red-loaded and docetaxel-loaded HER2 immuno-nanocapsules. The results indicate that our immuno-nanocapsules can increase their uptake in HER2 overexpressing tumoral cell lines."

In this work we used complementary bio-physico-chemical approaches to characterize the effects of interactions between CeO(2) NPs, immunoglobulins (IgGs) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) of a similar size on protein structural evolution as well as formation of (hetero-) aggregates. Using circular dichroism we showed that IgGs and BSA underwent significant structural changes after interaction with NPs. The NPs and protein-NPs were observed after size exclusion chromatography, highlighting the fact that few aggregates were stable enough to pass this mild separation step. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested that the surface chemistry of NPs was not affected by these proteins, also implying weak interactions. Competitive experiments revealed that, while the serum was more concentrated for BSA, IgG-NP aggregates were more stable. Altogether, our results indicate that, under our experimental conditions, the formation of a \"protein corona\" is an unstable and reversible mechanism. This indicates that, when NPs and proteins are similar in size, the adsorption concept (i.e. protein corona concept) cannot be applied to model the NP-protein interaction, and a heteroaggregation model is more appropriate.",

While the layer thickness of the protein corona has been well characterized in many cases, the absolute number of bound proteins and their exchange dynamics in body fluids is difficult to assess. Here we measure the number of molecules adsorbed to sulfonate (PSOSO(3)H) and carboxyl-(PSCOOH) polystyrene NPs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the fraction of molecules bound to NPs falls onto a single, universal adsorption curve, if plotted as a function of molar protein-to-NP ratio. The adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined protein-to-NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange, if competing unlabeled is added. In the presence of plasma proteins, the hard corona is stable, while the soft corona is almost completely removed. The existence of two distinct time scales in the protein off-kinetics, for both NP types studied here, indicates the possibility of an exposure memory effect in the NP corona."

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

The central aim of this study is to identify key protein recognition motifs and link them to specific cell-receptor interactions. Here, we employed an immuno-mapping technique to quantify epitope presentations of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G. Combining with a purpose-built receptor expression system, we show that both proteins present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I of the corona.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall.

Subsequent to membrane interactions, nanoparticles are typically internalized into the cell and trafficked along defined pathways such as, in many cases, the endolysosomal pathway. Indeed, if the original corona is partially retained on the nanoparticle surface, the biomolecules in this layer may play an important role in determining subsequent cellular processing. In this work, using a combination of organelle separation and fluorescence labeling of the initial extracellular corona, we clarify its intracellular evolution as nanoparticles travel within the cell. We show that specific proteins present in the original protein corona are retained on the nanoparticles until they accumulate in lysosomes, and, once there, they are degraded. We also report on how different bare surfaces (amino and carboxyl modified) affect the details of this evolution. One overarching discovery is that the same serum proteins can exhibit different intracellular processing when carried inside cells by nanoparticles, as components of their corona, compared to what is observed when they are transported freely from the extracellular medium.",

These results suggest that (nano)particle uptake might not follow commonly defined size limits for uptake processes, and highlight the variability of uptake kinetics for the same material in different cell types. These conclusions have important implications for the assessment of the safety of nanomaterials and for the potential biomedical applications of nanoparticles.",

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles (Walkey et al., 2012).

There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution (Zhang et al., 2019)."

Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated.

This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms.

The future success of clinically translatable nanomaterials lies in the combination of several functionalities to realize a personalized medical experience for patients. To maintain promises, concerns arising from toxic potential and off-target accumulation of nanomaterials must be addressed first. Upon introduction to a complex biological system (e.g., following systemic administration), nanomaterials interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein corona, a complex coating of plasma proteins that provides them with a totally new biological identity. As the protein corona controls the nanomaterial behavior in vivo, a precise knowledge of the relationship between biological identity and physiological response is needed but not yet achieved. Based on impressive progress made thus far, this review critically discusses how the protein corona activates immune response and influences the targeted delivery of nanomaterials. Furthermore, we comment on emerging strategies to manipulate protein binding in order to promote formation of designer artificial coronas and achieve a desired therapeutic outcome.

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies.",

The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity (Cai et al., 2018)[7](Francia et al., 2019). As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs (Wang et al., 2021). They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes...Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona (Lu et al., 2019).",

However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clinical application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biology (nano-bio) interactions. The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biological milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biological fluids (biofluids), environments, or biological structures) of nano-bio interactions. The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biological molecules and structures in the biological environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine. Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biological molecules, all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biological outcomes. In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines. In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines. First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, molecular recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biological environment. The physicochemical properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomolecule are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biological functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced. Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equilibrium and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers. Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradiation-induced processes. Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design. We expect our efforts in understanding the nano-bio interaction and the future development of this field will bring nanomedicine to human use more quickly.",

Here, by taking graphene/gold as examples, we comprehensively assessed the association of surface properties with the protein corona. As revealed by in vitro measurements and computations, the interaction between graphene/gold and HSA/IgE was inversely correlated with the hydroxyl group availability, whereas the interaction between that and ApoE was comparatively less relevant. Molecular simulations revealed that the number and the distribution of surface hydroxyl groups could regulate the manner in which nanomaterials interact with proteins. Moreover, we validated that ApoE pre-adsorption before injection enhances the blood circulation of nanomaterials relative to their pristine and IgE-coated counterparts. This benefit can be attributed to the invulnerability of the complementary system provided by ApoE, whose encasement does not increase cytotoxicity. Overall, this study offers a robust yet simple way to create protein corona enriched in dysopsonins to realize better delivery efficacy. The interaction between proteins and nanomaterials is complex and of interest for controlling nanoparticle fate. Here, using experimental and computational methods, the authors report on the effect of hydroxyl groups on protein interaction and how they can be used to enhance circulation times.",

Like other types of nanomaterials, once liposomes are incubated in a biological milieu, their surface can be immediately cloaked by biological components to form a protein corona, which confers a new \u2018biological identity\u2019 and modulates downstream interactions with cells. However, it remains unclear how the protein corona affects the transportation mechanism after liposomes interact with cells. Here, we employed home-made aggregation-induced-emission-visualized nanoliposomes TR4@Lipo as a model to investigate transportation with or without the protein corona by optical imaging techniques. The results show that the protein corona can change the cellular transportation mechanism of TR4@Lipo from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis. The protein corona also modulates the intracellular distribution of loaded cargoes. This knowledge furthers our understanding of bio-nano interactions and is important for the efficient use of cationic liposomes.",

This wide gap between bench discoveries and clinical application is mainly due to the limited understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials. When they are exposed to the human body, nanoparticles inevitably interact with bodily fluids and thereby adsorb hundreds of biomolecules. A \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d forms on the surface of nanomaterials and confers a new biological identity for NPs, which determines the following biological events: cellular uptake, immune response, biodistribution, clearance, and toxicity. A deep and thorough understanding of the biological effects triggered by the protein corona in vivo will speed up their translation to the clinic. To date, nearly all studies have attempted to characterize the components of protein coronas depending on different physiochemical properties of NPs. Herein, recent advances are reviewed in order to better understand the impact of the biological effects of the nanoparticle\u2013corona on nanomedicine applications. The recent development of the impact of protein corona formation on the pharmacokinetics of nanomedicines is also highlighted. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of nanomedicine toward future clinical applications are discussed."

Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene.

The results from these early clinical trials suggest that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and the novel ionizable lipids that comprise them, will be important materials in this emerging field of medicine. A persistent theme in the use of materials for biomedical applications has been the incorporation of biodegradability as a means to improve biocompatibility and/or to facilitate elimination. Therefore, the aim of this work was to further advance the LNP platform through the development of novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. As a representative example of this novel class of biodegradable lipids, the lipid evaluated in this work displays rapid elimination from plasma and tissues, substantially improved tolerability in preclinical studies, while maintaining in vivo potency on par with that of the most advanced lipids currently available."

Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated.

Nevertheless, only a dozen years ago the scientific community had to take a serious step backward (or forward) in this regard, based on the fact that NPs, as any other physical entities having an active surface area, can interact with the surrounding environment [1,2]. This means that when NPs enter into the bloodstream a complex interaction with the native proteins begins immediately. As protein corona (PC) builds up rapidly on the surface of NPs, their original size and surface properties change. Thus, all efforts to chemically engineer the surface characteristics of NPs and tune in vivo targeting and pharmacokinetics become transient and can be voided by the formation of PC. In fact, it is often the external PC that determines the true \u2018biological identity\u2019 and the in vivo fate of the NPs, including aggregation, circulation time, clearance rate and targeting [3]. This is a learnt lesson and \u2013 as in many other cases \u2013 scientists have rapidly turned a challenge into an opportunity. For instance, not only formation, kinetics and dynamic nature of the PC have been investigated in the last few years, but also strategies to either minimize its building-up or exploit its use for targeting purposes have been developed [4]. Nevertheless, the majority of studies on PC and colloidal stability of NPs are performed in blood or serum, thus only related to NPs administration by injection [3,5].",

Hence, protein\u2013NP interaction should be carefully investigated to predict and control the fate of NPs or drug-loaded NPs, including systemic circulation, biodistribution, and bioavailability. In this review, we mainly focus on the formation of protein corona and its potential applications in pharmaceutical sciences such as prediction modeling based on NP-adsorbed proteins, usage of active proteins for modifying NP to achieve toxicity reduction, circulation time enhancement, and targeting effect. Validated correlative models for NP biological responses mainly based on protein corona fingerprints of NPs are more highly accurate than the models solely set up from NP properties. Based on these models, effectiveness as well as the toxicity of NPs can be predicted without in vivo tests, while novel cell receptors could be identified from prominent proteins which play important key roles in the models. The ungoverned protein adsorption onto NPs may have generally negative effects such as rapid clearance from the bloodstream, hindrance of targeting capacity, and induction of toxicity. In contrast, controlling protein adsorption by modifying NPs with diverse functional proteins or tailoring appropriate NPs which favor selective endogenous peptides and proteins will bring promising therapeutic benefits in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.",

Although PMOXA-engineered NPs have shown comparable pharmacokinetics and in vivo performance to PEGylated stealth NPs in the murine model, its interaction with elements of the human innate immune system has not been studied. From a translational angle, we studied the interaction of fully characterized PMOXA-coated vinyltriethoxysilane-derived organically modified silica NPs (PMOXA-coated NPs) of approximately 100 nm in diameter with human complement system, blood leukocytes, and macrophages and compared their performance with PEGylated and uncoated NP counterparts. Through detailed immunological and proteomic profiling, we show that PMOXA-coated NPs extensively trigger complement activation in human sera exclusively through the classical pathway. Complement activation is initiated by the sensing molecule C1q, where C1q binds with high affinity ( Kd = 11 \u00b1 1 nM) to NP surfaces independent of immunoglobulin binding. C1q-mediated complement activation accelerates PMOXA opsonization with the third complement protein (C3) through the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. This promoted NP recognition by human blood leukocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. The macrophage capture of PMOXA-coated NPs correlates with sera donor variability in complement activation and opsonization but not with other major corona proteins, including clusterin and a wide range of apolipoproteins. In contrast to these observations, PMOXA-coated NPs poorly activated the murine complement system and were marginally recognized by mouse macrophages. These studies provide important insights into compatibility of engineered NPs with elements of the human innate immune system for translational steps.",

The functional mapping of opsonins and dysopsonins is instrumental to design long-circulating and nanotoxicologically safe next-generation nanotheranostics. In this review, we critically analyze functional data identifying specific proteins with opsonin or dysopsonin properties. Special attention is dedicated to the following: (1) the simplicity or complexity of the NP proteome and its modulation, (2) the role of specific host proteins in mediating the stealth properties of uncoated or polymer-coated NPs, and (3) the ability of the innate immune system, and, in particular, of the complement proteins, to mediate NP clearance by phagocytes. Emerging species-specific peculiarities, differentiating humans from preclinical animal models (the murine especially), are highlighted throughout this overview. The operative definition of opsonin and dysopsonin and the measurement schemes to assess their in vitro efficacy is critically re-examined. This provides a shared and unbiased approach useful for NP opsonin and dysopsonin systematic identification."

On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs.

This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona (Xiao et al., 2022). Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics (Wang et al., 2022). On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake (Wang et al., 2022)."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes.

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

Over the past years, several approaches and compounds developed for the treatment of AD have failed in clinical studies, likely in part due to their low penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Since nanotechnology-based strategies offer new possibilities for the delivery of drugs to the brain, this technique is studied intensively for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders.MethodsThe A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen was embedded in polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles by emulsification-diffusion technique and their potential as drug carriers in an in vitro BBB model was examined. First, the cytotoxic potential of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles on endothelial cells and the cellular binding and uptake by endothelial cells was studied. Furthermore, the biological activity of the nanoparticulate flurbiprofen on \u03b3-secretase modulation as well as its in vitro release was examined. Furthermore, the protein corona of the nanoparticles was studied as well as their ability to transport flurbiprofen across an in vitro BBB model.ResultsPLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles were endocytosed by endothelial cells and neither affected the vitality nor barrier function of the endothelial cell monolayer. The exposure of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles to human plasma occurred in a rapid protein corona formation, resulting in their decoration with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E. Furthermore, luminally administered PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles in contrast to free flurbiprofen were able to modulate \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels in the abluminal compartment of the BBB model.ConclusionsIn this study, we were able to show that flurbiprofen can be transported by PLA nanoparticles across an in vitro BBB model and most importantly, the transported flurbiprofen modulated \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels. These results demonstrate that the modification of drugs via embedding in nanoparticles is a promising tool to facilitate drug delivery to the brain, which enables future development for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like AD."

Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting revealed that, after incubation with rat serum, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed more onto PEG-PHDCA than on PHDCA nanoparticles. Adsorption of apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) onto PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles was demonstrated by capillary electrophoresis experiments. Moreover, only when ApoE or ApoB-100 were preadsorbed onto PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles, nanoparticles were found to be more efficient than control nanoparticles for penetrating into RBEC, suggesting the involvement of a low density lipoprotein receptor in this process. Thus, these data clearly demonstrate the involvement of apolipoproteins in the brain transport of PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles, which may open interesting prospects for brain drug delivery."

The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (Hellstrand et al., 2009), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (Lara et al., 2017) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (Lara et al., 2017). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (Bertrand et al., 2017) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density.",

We report the first investigation of the protein corona adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes modified with 2 kDa molecular weight polyethylene glycol chains [PEG(2k)-modified SWCNTs or PEG2-SWCNTs] by using a large-scale gel-based proteomics method on biological replicates. More than 240 plasma proteins were selected, and their differences were analyzed among PEG2-SWCNTs differing in surface charge and PEG conformation. The protein corona of PEG2-SWCNTs showed that coagulation proteins, immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, and proteins of the complement system were among the proteins bound by PEG2-SWCNTs and that their recruitment was independent from the isoelectric point, molecular weight, total hydrophobicity, and number of polyaromatic residues of the proteins. Statistical analysis on protein relative abundance revealed that PEG conformation had a higher influence on the PEG2-SWCNTs' protein corona repertoire than nanotube surface charge. PEG conformation also affected the biological performance of PEG2-SWCNTs. A change in PEG conformation from mushroom to mushroom-brush transition affected the competitive adsorption of the major constituents of the protein corona of PEG2-SWCNTs and promoted shorter blood circulation time, faster renal excretion, and higher relative spleen versus liver uptake of PEG2-SWCNTs. Our data suggest that the protein corona, along with steric stabilization, may mediate the action of PEG conformation on the pharmacokinetic profile of PEG-modified SWCNTs.",

Understanding the time evolution of the protein corona on the time-scales of a particle's lifetime in blood is fundamental to predict its fate in vivo. In this study, we used lipid NPs, the cationic lipid 3\u03b2-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] (DC-Chol) and the zwitterionic lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), that are among the most promising nanocarriers both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we investigated the time evolution of DC-Chol-DOPE NPs upon exposure to HP. On time scales between 1 and 60 minutes, nanoliquid tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the protein corona of DC-Chol-DOPE NPs is mainly constituted of apolipoproteins (Apo A-I, Apo C-II, Apo D, and Apo E are the most enriched). Since the total apolipoprotein content is relevant, we exploited the protein corona to target PC3 prostate carcinoma cell line that expresses high levels of scavenger receptor class B type 1 receptor, which mediates the bidirectional lipid transfer between low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, and cells.

The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (Hellstrand et al., 2009), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (Lara et al., 2017) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (Lara et al., 2017). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (Bertrand et al., 2017) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density."

This provides necessary context for the specific protein interactions discussed later.\n\n2. \"Apolipoprotein E Influence on Tissue Targeting\" - This will be a synthesis paragraph as the information is interconnected and focuses on how ApoE in the corona affects where LNPs go in the body, particularly its role in liver targeting and blood-brain barrier crossing. This requires explanation rather than a simple list.\n\n3. \"Albumin Effects on Circulation and Cellular Uptake\" - This will be a synthesis paragraph as the information about albumin's effects needs to be explained in context, showing the relationships between its presence in the corona and the resulting biological behaviors.\n\n4. \"Immunoglobulins and Immune Recognition Mechanisms\" - This will be a synthesis paragraph explaining how immunoglobulins in the corona influence immune system recognition and cellular uptake of LNPs, which involves complex interactions rather than discrete points.\n\n5. \"Mechanisms of Cellular Uptake Influenced by Corona Proteins\" - This will be a synthesis paragraph describing how the various proteins in the corona affect the specific mechanisms by which cells internalize LNPs, as this involves interrelated pathways and processes.\n\n6. \"Strategies for Controlling Protein Corona Composition\" - This will be a synthesis paragraph covering approaches to manipulate the corona composition to achieve desired targeting or uptake properties, showing how the understanding of protein interactions can be applied.\n\nThese dimensions follow a logical progression from basic introduction to specific proteins (matching the query's focus on ApoE, albumin, and immunoglobulins) to mechanisms and applications. All dimensions will be in synthesis format because the information requires integrated explanation rather than simple listing.",

The formation dynamics and composition of this corona are influenced by multiple factors, including the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties (size, shape, surface chemistry) and the biological environment encountered <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCommon proteins found in the corona include albumin, apolipoproteins (particularly apolipoprotein E), fibrinogen, complement proteins, and immunoglobulins <Paper corpusId=\"246781107\" paperTitle=\"(Martin-Contreras et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The presence of these specific proteins can dramatically alter how nanoparticles interact with biological systems. For instance, apolipoprotein E in the corona has been shown to facilitate nanoparticle transport across the blood-brain barrier <Paper corpusId=\"231612385\" paperTitle=\"(Simon et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"264370341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>, while opsonins like complement proteins and immunoglobulins can promote recognition and clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system <Paper corpusId=\"257517407\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"209448694\" paperTitle=\"(Cai et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe biomolecular corona significantly impacts the in vivo fate of nanoparticles in several critical ways. It can alter cellular uptake mechanisms, shifting from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis pathways <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236277547\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

On one hand, certain corona components like apolipoprotein E can enhance tissue-specific targeting, such as brain delivery <Paper corpusId=\"264370341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. On the other hand, opsonization can lead to rapid clearance, reducing therapeutic efficacy. Strategies to control corona formation include surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which suppresses protein adsorption and decreases macrophage uptake <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>, or pre-coating nanoparticles with specific proteins like ApoE to extend circulation time and improve targeting <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnderstanding and controlling biomolecular corona formation is essential for developing effective nanomedicines, as interspecies differences in corona kinetics can impact the translation of findings from animal models to humans <Paper corpusId=\"21580291\" paperTitle=\"(Sahneh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been developed for imaging, drug delivery, diagnosis, and clinical therapeutic purposes because of their outstanding physicochemical characteristics. However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clinical application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biology (nano-bio) interactions. The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biological milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biological fluids (biofluids), environments, or biological structures) of nano-bio interactions. The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biological molecules and structures in the biological environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine. Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biological molecules, all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biological outcomes. In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines. In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines. First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, molecular recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biological environment. The physicochemical properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomolecule are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biological functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced. Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equilibrium and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers. Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradiation-induced processes. Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design. We expect our efforts in understanding the nano-bio interaction and the future development of this field will bring nanomedicine to human use more quickly."

                            "Protein adsorption to nanoparticles (NPs) is a key prerequisite to understand NP-cell interactions. While the layer thickness of the protein corona has been well characterized in many cases, the absolute number of bound proteins and their exchange dynamics in body fluids is difficult to assess. Here we measure the number of molecules adsorbed to sulfonate (PSOSO(3)H) and carboxyl-(PSCOOH) polystyrene NPs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the fraction of molecules bound to NPs falls onto a single, universal adsorption curve, if plotted as a function of molar protein-to-NP ratio. The adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined protein-to-NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange, if competing unlabeled is added. In the presence of plasma proteins, the hard corona is stable, while the soft corona is almost completely removed. The existence of two distinct time scales in the protein off-kinetics, for both NP types studied here, indicates the possibility of an exposure memory effect in the NP corona."

This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity (Cai et al., 2018)[7](Francia et al., 2019). As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs (Wang et al., 2021). They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes",

The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona (Lu et al., 2019)."

As the interface between NPs and cells or molecules, a protein corona is essential to the biological effects of NPs and even affects their therapeutic efficiency. More than 90% of NPs are removed by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, causing serious off-target effects and toxicity. However, monocyte phagocytosis of NPs may be affected by the formation of a protein corona, thus extending or shortening their blood circulation period and presenting opportunities or challenges to drug delivery design",

Therefore, lipid NPs have been decorated by incubation with ApoE4 to enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in the brain [51]. The design principle is dependent on the high affinity between ApoE and specific receptors in the BBB."

The formation of protein corona can impact the biological processes of NMs, such as long circulation time, biodistribution, immune cell activation, cytotoxicity, specific cellular uptake, targeting efficiency, and more [3]. For instance, the opsonin proteins in the biomolecular corona, including immunoglobulins and complement proteins, facilitate phagocytic recognition, leading to sequestration and reduced bioavailability of the NMs (Cai et al., 2019)."

                            "The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high-efficiency and good-safety for better clinical translation."

                            "Abstract Liposomes, especially cationic liposomes, are the most common and well-investigated nanocarriers for biomedical applications, such as drug and gene delivery. Like other types of nanomaterials, once liposomes are incubated in a biological milieu, their surface can be immediately cloaked by biological components to form a protein corona, which confers a new \u2018biological identity\u2019 and modulates downstream interactions with cells. However, it remains unclear how the protein corona affects the transportation mechanism after liposomes interact with cells. Here, we employed home-made aggregation-induced-emission-visualized nanoliposomes TR4@Lipo as a model to investigate transportation with or without the protein corona by optical imaging techniques. The results show that the protein corona can change the cellular transportation mechanism of TR4@Lipo from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis. The protein corona also modulates the intracellular distribution of loaded cargoes. This knowledge furthers our understanding of bio-nano interactions and is important for the efficient use of cationic liposomes."

This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona (Xiao et al., 2022). Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics (Wang et al., 2022). On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake (Wang et al., 2022)."

Here, by taking graphene/gold as examples, we comprehensively assessed the association of surface properties with the protein corona. As revealed by in vitro measurements and computations, the interaction between graphene/gold and HSA/IgE was inversely correlated with the hydroxyl group availability, whereas the interaction between that and ApoE was comparatively less relevant. Molecular simulations revealed that the number and the distribution of surface hydroxyl groups could regulate the manner in which nanomaterials interact with proteins. Moreover, we validated that ApoE pre-adsorption before injection enhances the blood circulation of nanomaterials relative to their pristine and IgE-coated counterparts. This benefit can be attributed to the invulnerability of the complementary system provided by ApoE, whose encasement does not increase cytotoxicity. Overall, this study offers a robust yet simple way to create protein corona enriched in dysopsonins to realize better delivery efficacy. The interaction between proteins and nanomaterials is complex and of interest for controlling nanoparticle fate. Here, using experimental and computational methods, the authors report on the effect of hydroxyl groups on protein interaction and how they can be used to enhance circulation times."

                "tldr": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the biomolecular corona plays a critical role in determining tissue targeting capabilities of lipid nanoparticles. ApoE-enriched coronas facilitate liver uptake through interaction with low-density lipoprotein receptors and enhance transport across the blood-brain barrier, while its depletion can redirect nanoparticles to other tissues. (19 sources)",
                "text": "\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE) has emerged as one of the most influential serum proteins in the biomolecular corona, significantly impacting the tissue-specific targeting of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in vivo. The presence of ApoE in the corona can drastically alter nanoparticle biodistribution and cellular uptake patterns, particularly enabling enhanced targeting to specific tissues such as the liver and brain <Paper corpusId=\"253717582\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"228077248\" paperTitle=\"(Aliyandi et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe liver-targeting capabilities of LNPs are strongly mediated by ApoE adsorption onto their surface. Once in circulation, LNPs become coated with ApoE, which acts as an endogenous targeting ligand by binding to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) that are highly expressed on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248947767\" paperTitle=\"(Kazemian et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This ApoE-LDLR interaction facilitates receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent internalization of nanoparticles into liver cells <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The clinically approved LNP-based siRNA therapeutic Onpattro exemplifies this mechanism, as its liver tropism is attributed to its ability to recruit ApoE to its surface, enabling efficient hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond liver targeting, ApoE in the corona plays a crucial role in enabling nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Multiple studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles coated with ApoE show enhanced transport across the BBB compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231612385\" paperTitle=\"(Simon et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This was particularly evident in studies with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, where ApoE coating facilitated BBB crossing and enabled delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain <Paper corpusId=\"2957695\" paperTitle=\"(Teske et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanism appears to involve interaction with LDL receptors and other receptors containing ApoE binding ligands expressed on brain endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"244811268\" paperTitle=\"(Ribovski et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe relative abundance of ApoE in the corona can be manipulated through careful engineering of nanoparticle properties. Surface chemistry, charge, and lipid composition significantly influence ApoE adsorption and consequently the targeting capabilities of nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"245512802\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203153060\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, ionizable LNPs typically recruit ApoE more efficiently than cationic LNPs, explaining their superior hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the density of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on nanoparticle surfaces affects ApoE adsorption, with lower PEG coverage sometimes allowing for more apolipoprotein binding <Paper corpusId=\"4629025\" paperTitle=\"(Bertrand et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, for targeting tissues other than the liver, researchers have found that reducing ApoE content in the corona can be beneficial. A lower ApoE content reduces liver sequestration, potentially enabling nanoparticles to reach other tissues <Paper corpusId=\"271589862\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This was demonstrated in studies with selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, where decreased ApoE adsorption corresponded with improved delivery to non-liver tissues, including enhanced transfection of immune cells <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe role of ApoE can also be harnessed through pre-coating strategies. Pre-coating nanoparticles with ApoE before administration has been shown to improve their targeting capabilities and extend circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach provides more control over the corona composition and can enhance transport across biological barriers like the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"264370341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advances in LNP design have further exploited this understanding of ApoE's role. For example, researchers have developed peptides that specifically bind to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available for interaction with target receptors. This strategy has shown promising results for brain targeting of nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"199491776\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, modulating the chemical structure of lipids within LNPs has been used to selectively regulate protein corona composition, including ApoE content, to achieve specific organ targeting <Paper corpusId=\"246902168\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn summary, ApoE in the biomolecular corona serves as a critical determinant of LNP tissue targeting. Its presence facilitates liver and brain delivery through interaction with specific receptors, while its reduction can enable targeting to other tissues. Understanding and manipulating ApoE adsorption offers significant opportunities for enhancing the tissue-specific delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles.",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes.

                            "The physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo. A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]."

Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles (Walkey et al., 2012). Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution (Zhang et al., 2019)."

                            "The application of lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems remains a popular strategy for the systemic delivery of gene therapies to specific disease targets, including solid tumors. It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

Here, we use a library of polymer nanoparticles to show how physicochemical characteristics influence blood circulation and early distribution. For particles with different diameters, surface hydrophilicity appears to mediate early clearance. Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5\u2009kDa) per 100\u2009nm2 prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density. These results further our understanding of nanopharmacology. Understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and biomolecules is crucial for improving current drug-delivery systems. Here, the authors shed light on the essential role of the surface and other physicochemical properties of a library of nanoparticles on their in vivo pharmacokinetics."

[34] Such an observation was supported by earlier studies showing increased uptake by macrophages. [114] It was hypothesized that the recruitment of \u03b22-GPI can be mediated by the inclusion of anionic lipid in the formulation. Successful delivery to the immune cell population was also shown to be associated with a low content of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the protein corona. It was rationalized that ApoE leads to the capture of the particle by the liver through the receptor-dependent pathway, conferring a predominant hepatic tropism. Thus, surface chemistry that resists the adsorption of ApoE might prove a viable strategy for improving immune cell transfection in in vivo."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "Control over the protein corona of nanomaterials allows them to function better. Here, by taking graphene/gold as examples, we comprehensively assessed the association of surface properties with the protein corona. As revealed by in vitro measurements and computations, the interaction between graphene/gold and HSA/IgE was inversely correlated with the hydroxyl group availability, whereas the interaction between that and ApoE was comparatively less relevant. Molecular simulations revealed that the number and the distribution of surface hydroxyl groups could regulate the manner in which nanomaterials interact with proteins. Moreover, we validated that ApoE pre-adsorption before injection enhances the blood circulation of nanomaterials relative to their pristine and IgE-coated counterparts. This benefit can be attributed to the invulnerability of the complementary system provided by ApoE, whose encasement does not increase cytotoxicity. Overall, this study offers a robust yet simple way to create protein corona enriched in dysopsonins to realize better delivery efficacy. The interaction between proteins and nanomaterials is complex and of interest for controlling nanoparticle fate. Here, using experimental and computational methods, the authors report on the effect of hydroxyl groups on protein interaction and how they can be used to enhance circulation times."

As the interface between NPs and cells or molecules, a protein corona is essential to the biological effects of NPs and even affects their therapeutic efficiency. More than 90% of NPs are removed by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, causing serious off-target effects and toxicity. However, monocyte phagocytosis of NPs may be affected by the formation of a protein corona, thus extending or shortening their blood circulation period and presenting opportunities or challenges to drug delivery design",

                            "Protein corona presents a major obstacle to bench-to-bedside translation of targeted drug delivery systems, severely affecting targeting yields and directing unfavorable biodistribution. Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes. Here, the authors develop bio-inspired liposomes that specifically absorb brain-targeted apolipoproteins and preserve their bioactivities, thereby achieving efficient brain targeting with minor influence on immunocompatibility of liposomes."

                            "Significance The current application of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based technology has largely been confined to liver diseases because of the lack of a specific and efficient extrahepatic in vivo systemic mRNA delivery system. Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM."

Albumin coating can also alter cellular uptake mechanisms and intracellular trafficking of lipid nanoparticles, providing alternative pathways for liver targeting independent of apolipoprotein E. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nSerum albumin, the most abundant protein in blood plasma, plays a distinctive role in the biomolecular corona of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), significantly influencing their circulation time and cellular interactions. In contrast to opsonins like immunoglobulins and complement proteins that promote rapid clearance, albumin functions as a \"dysopsonin\" that extends the circulation half-life of nanoparticles in the bloodstream <Paper corpusId=\"253379070\" paperTitle=\"(Shao et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259242177\" paperTitle=\"(Hardy et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This protective effect occurs because albumin adsorption on the nanoparticle surface can mask recognition sites that would otherwise trigger uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe presence of albumin in the corona not only extends circulation time but also fundamentally alters how nanoparticles interact with cells. Studies have shown that albumin coating can switch the cellular entry mechanisms from one pathway to another. For instance, precoating nanoparticles with human serum albumin has been observed to modify the internalization pathway from macropinocytosis to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), leading to altered intracellular trafficking <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This modification of uptake mechanisms can be particularly important for controlling the intracellular fate of therapeutic cargoes.\n\nRecent investigations have demonstrated that the protein corona's composition can significantly affect nanoparticle uptake mechanisms in a concentration-dependent manner. Francia et al. showed that silica nanoparticles with different corona compositions were internalized via different cellular mechanisms, with only specific corona conditions enabling uptake through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"202673667\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that careful control of corona composition could enable selective targeting of specific cellular receptors and uptake pathways.\n\nIn the context of liver targeting, albumin coating has emerged as an alternative to the apolipoprotein E-dependent pathway. Studies have shown that albumin-coated mRNA-LNPs can be delivered to the liver through ApoE-independent cellular pathways <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This alternative targeting mechanism could be particularly valuable for patients with ApoE deficiencies or when targeting hepatocytes that express low levels of LDLR.\n\nThe strategic utilization of albumin in the corona can be achieved through pre-coating approaches. Human serum albumin and apolipoprotein E have been used to form stable conjugates with nanoparticles prior to intravenous injection <Paper corpusId=\"253717582\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al._1, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This pre-coating strategy provides better control over the corona composition and can help achieve desired biological outcomes such as extended circulation or specific tissue targeting.\n\nMolecular imprinting has also been explored as an innovative approach to regulate protein corona formation in vivo. Takeuchi et al. demonstrated that nanogels molecularly imprinted to capture albumin formed an albumin-rich protein corona immediately after injection, resulting in extended blood circulation time and reduced liver retention <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"37711193\" paperTitle=\"(Takeuchi et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach represents a promising strategy for controlling corona composition to achieve desired pharmacokinetic profiles.\n\nUnderstanding how albumin in the corona affects nanoparticle fate is particularly important for translational applications. The impact of albumin on circulation time and cellular uptake can vary between species, with significant differences observed between murine models and humans <Paper corpusId=\"274288470\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These species-specific variations must be considered when translating findings from preclinical models to clinical applications.\n\nIn summary, albumin in the biomolecular corona serves as a key determinant of nanoparticle circulation time and cellular uptake mechanisms. By functioning as a dysopsonin, albumin can protect nanoparticles from rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system, while also modulating their cellular entry pathways. Strategic manipulation of albumin adsorption, through approaches like pre-coating or molecular imprinting, offers promising opportunities for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of lipid nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.",

Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E (Papini et al., 2020). Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms (Wang et al., 1998). Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood (Papini et al., 2020)."

                            "The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces (Wang et al., 2019). This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity (Cai et al., 2018)[7](Francia et al., 2019). As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs (Wang et al., 2021). They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes",
                            "Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona (Lu et al., 2019)."

Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier (Kreuter et al., 2002), while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR (Francia et al., 2019)(Lara et al., 2017)",

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]."

                            "Protein corona formation was regulated on the surface in\u2005vivo by molecular imprinting to enable polymeric nanogels to acquire stealth upon intravenous administration. Albumin, the most abundant protein in blood, was selected as a distinct protein component of protein corona for preparing molecularly imprinted nanogels (MIP-NGs) to form an albumin-rich protein corona. Intravital fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging of rhodamine-labeled albumin and fluorescein-conjugated MIP-NGs showed that albumin was captured by MIP-NGs immediately after injection, forming an albumin-rich protein corona. MIP-NGs circulated in the blood longer than those of non-albumin-imprinted nanogels, with almost no retention in liver tissue. MIP-NGs also passively accumulated in tumor tissue. These data suggest that this strategy, based on regulation of the protein corona in\u2005vivo, may significantly influence the development of drug nanocarriers for cancer therapy."

                "tldr": "Immunoglobulins in the biomolecular corona play a critical role in marking nanoparticles for immune recognition and clearance, acting as opsonins that promote phagocytosis by macrophages and other immune cells. Unlike dysopsonins such as albumin, immunoglobulins accelerate nanoparticle clearance through receptor-mediated interactions, particularly via Fc-gamma receptors on phagocytic cells. (14 sources)",
                "text": "\nImmunoglobulins represent a significant class of proteins in the biomolecular corona that directly influence the immune system's recognition and response to lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Unlike dysopsonic proteins such as albumin that extend circulation time, immunoglobulins function as opsonins that facilitate recognition and clearance of nanoparticles by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) <Paper corpusId=\"16843753\" paperTitle=\"(Corbo et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This opsonization process involves the adsorption of various plasma proteins, including immunoglobulins such as IgG or IgM, onto the nanoparticle surface, marking them for immune recognition <Paper corpusId=\"246781107\" paperTitle=\"(Martin-Contreras et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"210983709\" paperTitle=\"(Digiacomo et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe presence of immunoglobulins in the corona significantly affects cellular uptake mechanisms through specific receptor interactions. Studies have shown that nanoparticles opsonized with immunoglobulins promote receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This process involves the recognition of the Fc portion of adsorbed immunoglobulins by Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3R) on phagocytic cells. Lara et al. demonstrated that immunoglobulin G in the corona of silica nanoparticles presented functional motifs that allowed recognition by Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI), facilitating cellular uptake <Paper corpusId=\"262546540\" paperTitle=\"(Lara et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This receptor-mediated recognition mechanism enables macrophages and other immune cells to identify nanoparticles as foreign entities that require clearance from circulation <Paper corpusId=\"59528114\" paperTitle=\"(Fadeel, 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe functional implications of immunoglobulin-mediated recognition extend beyond simply promoting clearance. The binding of immunoglobulins to nanoparticles can also trigger complement activation, further enhancing immune recognition through additional opsonization with complement proteins such as C3b <Paper corpusId=\"4764886\" paperTitle=\"(Daldrup-Link, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual opsonization with both immunoglobulins and complement components creates a potent signal for phagocytic cells, accelerating nanoparticle clearance from circulation and potentially inducing inflammatory responses <Paper corpusId=\"257517407\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"209448694\" paperTitle=\"(Cai et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent studies have highlighted that the interaction between immunoglobulins in the corona and cellular receptors can lead to more than just clearance. Francia et al. demonstrated that the composition of the protein corona affects the specific uptake mechanisms employed by cells, with immunoglobulin G in the corona enabling uptake through the Fc-gamma receptor I <Paper corpusId=\"211143787\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"202673667\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the presence of specific immunoglobulins in the corona can route nanoparticles through distinct cellular entry pathways, potentially affecting their intracellular fate and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nThe adsorption of immunoglobulins onto nanoparticles can also have significant consequences for therapeutic applications. Recent studies have clarified that opsonization by immunoglobulins not only accelerates the recognition and clearance of liposomes by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) but can also trigger broader immune responses <Paper corpusId=\"253379070\" paperTitle=\"(Shao et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This can result in reduced circulation time, diminished therapeutic efficacy, and potentially adverse immune reactions.\n\nStrategies to mitigate immunoglobulin-mediated clearance often involve surface modifications that reduce protein adsorption. The presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on nanoparticle surfaces has been shown to suppress protein adsorption, including immunoglobulins, resulting in decreased uptake by macrophages and extended circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"stealth\" effect of PEGylation helps nanoparticles evade immune recognition, allowing them to reach their intended targets more effectively.\n\nUnderstanding the role of immunoglobulins in the corona has important implications for the design of nanoparticles intended for specific tissues. While apolipoproteins like ApoE can facilitate liver and brain targeting, the presence of immunoglobulins generally promotes clearance by immune cells <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Thus, controlling the adsorption of immunoglobulins versus beneficial targeting proteins represents a critical balance in nanoparticle design. By manipulating surface properties to selectively promote or prevent immunoglobulin binding, researchers can potentially direct nanoparticles to specific tissues while avoiding premature immune clearance <Paper corpusId=\"44171062\" paperTitle=\"(Simon et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

This sequestration is achieved through the binding of these PC proteins to specific receptors on the surface of the phagocytes that are responsible for the removal of pathogens and negatively charged ligands circulating in the blood. This ligand-receptor recognition causes the internalization of NPs, their transport to phagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes (Blanco et al., 2015)12,(Digiacomo et al., 2020) (Figure 3)."

                            "Over the last decade nanomaterials have had a major impact on human health for the early detection and treatment of many diseases. The future success of clinically translatable nanomaterials lies in the combination of several functionalities to realize a personalized medical experience for patients. To maintain promises, concerns arising from toxic potential and off-target accumulation of nanomaterials must be addressed first. Upon introduction to a complex biological system (e.g., following systemic administration), nanomaterials interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein corona, a complex coating of plasma proteins that provides them with a totally new biological identity. As the protein corona controls the nanomaterial behavior in vivo, a precise knowledge of the relationship between biological identity and physiological response is needed but not yet achieved. Based on impressive progress made thus far, this review critically discusses how the protein corona activates immune response and influences the targeted delivery of nanomaterials. Furthermore, we comment on emerging strategies to manipulate protein binding in order to promote formation of designer artificial coronas and achieve a desired therapeutic outcome. We conclude by debating challenges that must be overcome to obtain widespread clinical adoption of nanomaterials.

                            "Biomolecules adsorbed on nanoparticles are known to confer a biological identity to nanoparticles, mediating the interactions with cells and biological barriers. However, how these molecules are presented on the particle surface in biological milieu remains unclear. The central aim of this study is to identify key protein recognition motifs and link them to specific cell-receptor interactions. Here, we employed an immuno-mapping technique to quantify epitope presentations of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G. Combining with a purpose-built receptor expression system, we show that both proteins present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I of the corona. Our results suggest that the \"labeling\" of nanoparticles by biomolecular adsorption processes allows for multiple pathways in biological processes in which they may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous objects, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous ones, such as viral infections."

                            "It is pertinent to note that apolipoproteins are frequently detected in the bio-corona of various NPs (Sacchetti et al., 2013)(Barr\u00e1n-Berd\u00f3n et al., 2013). The results of the aforementioned study implied that such NPs may be recognized by living systems as HDL complexes, and that nanoparticles may exploit existing transport pathways for lipoprotein particles (Hellstrand et al., 2009), underscoring that recognition and handling of NPs may transpire via conserved pathways. In a recent study, Lara et al. (Lara et al., 2017) provided evidence, using an elegant immuno-epitope mapping approach, that two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G, present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that NPs may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous particles, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous entities, such as viruses, by virtue of specific components of the bio-corona (Lara et al., 2017). Does this have any implications for the in vivo fate of NPs? In a recent study using NPs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) copolymers, Bertrand et al. (Bertrand et al., 2017) could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the NPs into mice appeared to be dependent on PEG density; the authors also found that for NPs with low PEG coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins could prolong circulation times. In addition, the LDLR was found to play a key role in the clearance of NPs, irrespective of PEG density."

                            "The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high-efficiency and good-safety for better clinical translation."

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

This protein-dependent uptake can switch nanoparticles between energy-independent membrane fusion and energy-dependent endocytosis, significantly altering their intracellular trafficking and therapeutic efficacy. (17 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe biomolecular corona fundamentally alters how lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) interact with cells by activating specific receptor-mediated uptake pathways that would be unavailable to the bare nanoparticle surface. Various proteins in the corona can serve as ligands that bind to specific cellular receptors, directing nanoparticles through distinct internalization routes. This receptor-ligand interaction represents a critical mechanism by which the corona composition directly determines cellular uptake efficiency and pathway selection.\n\nSpecific proteins in the corona interact with corresponding receptors on cell surfaces to facilitate internalization. Apolipoprotein E in the corona promotes uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), which are highly expressed on hepatocytes, explaining the liver tropism of many LNP formulations <Paper corpusId=\"275712592\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259353478\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This LDLR-mediated uptake of ApoE-enriched LNPs represents a key mechanism for liver targeting and has been exploited in clinically approved therapeutics such as Onpattro <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, vitronectin in the corona can promote uptake via \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors on cancer cells, providing an opportunity for tumor targeting <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206788144\" paperTitle=\"(Caracciolo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232140956\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nImmunoglobulins in the corona function as opsonins that facilitate recognition by immune cells through Fc-gamma receptors. Studies have shown that nanoparticles opsonized with immunoglobulins promote receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. In particular, immunoglobulin G in the corona of silica nanoparticles has been shown to present functional motifs that allow recognition by Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI), facilitating cellular uptake <Paper corpusId=\"211143787\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"262546540\" paperTitle=\"(Lara et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This receptor-mediated recognition enables macrophages and other immune cells to identify nanoparticles as foreign entities that require clearance from circulation.\n\nThe corona composition can fundamentally alter the energy requirements for nanoparticle internalization. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of a protein corona can switch the cellular transportation mechanism of cationic liposomes from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236277547\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This shift in uptake mechanism significantly impacts the intracellular distribution of nanoparticles and their therapeutic cargoes, with corona-coated nanoparticles typically being directed to lysosomes rather than achieving nuclear localization.\n\nA key finding in recent research is that the same nanoparticles can be internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Francia et al. demonstrated that silica nanoparticles were internalized through different pathways depending on the corona composition, with only specific corona conditions enabling uptake through the LDLR <Paper corpusId=\"202673667\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the corona composition can be manipulated to direct nanoparticles through preferred cellular entry pathways, potentially enhancing therapeutic delivery.\n\nThe corona can also mask targeting ligands that were deliberately incorporated into nanoparticle designs. Several studies have reported that the formation of a protein corona on nanoparticles may significantly hinder the interaction between targeting ligands and their receptors, thus reducing the targeting capabilities of functionalized nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"244897478\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"327224\" paperTitle=\"(Mirshafiee et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This masking effect represents a significant challenge for the development of targeted nanomedicines and highlights the importance of designing nanoparticles with corona formation in mind.\n\nPrecoating strategies can be employed to direct nanoparticles through specific uptake pathways. For instance, precoating nanoparticles with human serum albumin has been shown to modulate transient endocytic uptake, switching the internalization mechanism from macropinocytosis to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and altering intracellular trafficking <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, precoating with ApoE can enhance transport across the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated by studies with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, which showed significant therapeutic effects in vivo compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"14521639\" paperTitle=\"(Meister et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe presence of certain proteins in the corona can also prevent cellular uptake, functioning as \"don't-eat-me\" signals. Albumin and CD47 in the corona have been shown to prevent cellular nanoparticle uptake <Paper corpusId=\"4764886\" paperTitle=\"(Daldrup-Link, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>, while other proteins like clusterin have been associated with reduced uptake by cells <Paper corpusId=\"246061052\" paperTitle=\"(Salvati et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual nature of the protein corona \u2013 both promoting and preventing cellular uptake \u2013 creates what has been described as a \"Janus-like entity\" that can positively and negatively impact nanoparticle-based therapeutics <Paper corpusId=\"259699549\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of cellular uptake influenced by corona proteins is essential for designing effective nanomedicines. By strategically engineering nanoparticles to recruit specific proteins to their corona or employing precoating strategies, researchers can potentially direct nanoparticles through preferred cellular entry pathways, enhance tissue-specific targeting, and improve therapeutic outcomes.",

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier (Kreuter et al., 2002), while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR (Francia et al., 2019)(Lara et al., 2017)",

Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016)."

Materials & methods: 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane\u00a0LNPs were formulated, protein corona formed in nude mice serum and its impact on drug delivery were analyzed. Results: 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane-containing LNP led to enhanced recruitment of vitronectin and showed preferential transfection to \u03b1v\u03b23-expressed cells relative to controls. Upon systemic administration in mice, the LNPs accumulated in the \u03b1v\u03b23-expressing endothelial lining of the tumor blood vessels before reaching tumor cells. Conclusion: These results present an optimized LNP that selectively recruits endogenous proteins in situ to its corona which may lead to enhanced delivery and transfection in tissues of interest."

However, how these molecules are presented on the particle surface in biological milieu remains unclear. The central aim of this study is to identify key protein recognition motifs and link them to specific cell-receptor interactions. Here, we employed an immuno-mapping technique to quantify epitope presentations of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein and immunoglobulin G. Combining with a purpose-built receptor expression system, we show that both proteins present functional motifs to allow simultaneous recognition by low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I of the corona. Our results suggest that the \"labeling\" of nanoparticles by biomolecular adsorption processes allows for multiple pathways in biological processes in which they may be \"mistaken\" for endogenous objects, such as lipoproteins, and exogenous ones, such as viral infections."

                            "The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces (Wang et al., 2019). This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity (Cai et al., 2018)[7](Francia et al., 2019). As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs (Wang et al., 2021). They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes",
                            "Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona (Lu et al., 2019)."

Like other types of nanomaterials, once liposomes are incubated in a biological milieu, their surface can be immediately cloaked by biological components to form a protein corona, which confers a new \u2018biological identity\u2019 and modulates downstream interactions with cells. However, it remains unclear how the protein corona affects the transportation mechanism after liposomes interact with cells. Here, we employed home-made aggregation-induced-emission-visualized nanoliposomes TR4@Lipo as a model to investigate transportation with or without the protein corona by optical imaging techniques. The results show that the protein corona can change the cellular transportation mechanism of TR4@Lipo from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis. The protein corona also modulates the intracellular distribution of loaded cargoes. This knowledge furthers our understanding of bio-nano interactions and is important for the efficient use of cationic liposomes."

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

Moreover, the PC on synthetic nanoparticle would impact the receptor targeting, lysosomal escape, and BBB transcytosis (Xiao et al., 2021).

                            "IntroductionThe amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b242) peptide plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly. Over the past years, several approaches and compounds developed for the treatment of AD have failed in clinical studies, likely in part due to their low penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Since nanotechnology-based strategies offer new possibilities for the delivery of drugs to the brain, this technique is studied intensively for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders.MethodsThe A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen was embedded in polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles by emulsification-diffusion technique and their potential as drug carriers in an in vitro BBB model was examined. First, the cytotoxic potential of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles on endothelial cells and the cellular binding and uptake by endothelial cells was studied. Furthermore, the biological activity of the nanoparticulate flurbiprofen on \u03b3-secretase modulation as well as its in vitro release was examined. Furthermore, the protein corona of the nanoparticles was studied as well as their ability to transport flurbiprofen across an in vitro BBB model.ResultsPLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles were endocytosed by endothelial cells and neither affected the vitality nor barrier function of the endothelial cell monolayer. The exposure of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles to human plasma occurred in a rapid protein corona formation, resulting in their decoration with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E. Furthermore, luminally administered PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles in contrast to free flurbiprofen were able to modulate \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels in the abluminal compartment of the BBB model.ConclusionsIn this study, we were able to show that flurbiprofen can be transported by PLA nanoparticles across an in vitro BBB model and most importantly, the transported flurbiprofen modulated \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels. These results demonstrate that the modification of drugs via embedding in nanoparticles is a promising tool to facilitate drug delivery to the brain, which enables future development for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like AD."

                            "This protein layer significantly influences the biological behavior of nanocarriers by altering their physicochemical properties and can ultimately control their in vivo fate. This process significantly impacts nanocarriers' stability, targeting capacity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Therefore, the physiological function of nanoparticles heavily depends on the characterization of the proteins forming the corona (Xiao et al., 2022). Moreover, protein corona is a Janus-like entity that can positively and negatively impact NP-based therapeutics (Wang et al., 2022). On the one hand, protein corona can influence blood circulation, accumulation and penetration at targeting sites, cellular uptake in tumor-targeting delivery, and interactions between NPs and immune cells for immunotherapy. On the other hand, protein corona can also cause unpredictable in vivo behaviors due to the absorption of biomolecules on NPs. For instance, protein corona can reduce the interactions between NPs and the cell membrane by covering the initially modified ligands or presenting an unfavorable steric effect, which decreases cellular uptake (Wang et al., 2022)."

(13 sources)",
                "text": "\nControlling the composition of the protein corona represents a critical strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in vivo. The most widely implemented approach involves surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which has been shown to suppress protein adsorption, resulting in decreased macrophage uptake and extended circulation times in the bloodstream <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"stealth\" effect is particularly valuable for reducing opsonization by immunoglobulins and complement proteins that would otherwise promote rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system <Paper corpusId=\"244811268\" paperTitle=\"(Ribovski et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274288470\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPre-coating nanoparticles with specific proteins prior to administration has emerged as an effective strategy for directing their in vivo fate. Human serum albumin pre-coating has been shown to modulate cellular uptake mechanisms, switching internalization from macropinocytosis to clathrin-mediated endocytosis and altering intracellular trafficking <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, coating nanoparticles with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can significantly enhance transport across the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles that showed anti-nociceptive effects in vivo compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The principle behind this approach relies on the high affinity between ApoE and specific receptors in the blood-brain barrier <Paper corpusId=\"264370341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn innovative approach to exploit the beneficial properties of specific corona proteins involves the development of peptides that selectively bind to certain domains of proteins while leaving receptor-binding regions accessible. Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins <Paper corpusId=\"244811268\" paperTitle=\"(Ribovski et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"199491776\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy resulted in notable increases in brain distribution and enhanced anti-brain cancer effects <Paper corpusId=\"199491776\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor targeting non-liver tissues, strategies that reduce ApoE content in the corona have proven beneficial. Selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles designed to target the spleen have been shown to succeed due to their low ApoE content, which reduces liver sequestration <Paper corpusId=\"271589862\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Surface chemistry that resists ApoE adsorption represents a viable strategy for improving immune cell transfection in vivo, as ApoE typically leads to liver capture through receptor-dependent pathways <Paper corpusId=\"271589862\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA significant challenge in corona manipulation involves the masking of targeting ligands by adsorbed proteins. Several studies have reported that protein corona formation can significantly hinder the interaction between targeting ligands and their receptors, thus reducing the targeting capabilities of functionalized nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"244897478\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"327224\" paperTitle=\"(Mirshafiee et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This masking effect necessitates the development of corona-resistant targeting strategies or the incorporation of targeting mechanisms that work synergistically with the corona.\n\nCareful manipulation of nanoparticle surface properties can selectively promote the adsorption of beneficial proteins while minimizing detrimental ones. Lu et al. demonstrated that pre-coating nanoparticles with ApoE before injection enhances their blood circulation relative to pristine and IgE-coated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This benefit was attributed to the protection against complement system activation provided by ApoE, without increasing cytotoxicity <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advancements in understanding the driving forces that shape protein corona formation have enabled more precise control strategies. The interactions between nanoparticles and biological components are governed by various forces, including hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and molecular recognition interactions <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"171092341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. By manipulating these forces through surface engineering, researchers can influence corona composition and consequently the biological fate of nanoparticles.\n\nUnderstanding how protein corona affects cellular transportation mechanisms provides further opportunities for strategic intervention. Wang et al. demonstrated that the presence of a protein corona can switch the cellular transportation mechanism of cationic liposomes from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236277547\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This fundamental change in uptake mechanism significantly impacts the intracellular distribution of therapeutic cargoes and their ultimate efficacy.\n\nBy strategically controlling the protein corona composition through these various approaches, researchers can potentially enhance therapeutic delivery, improve tissue-specific targeting, and reduce undesired clearance, ultimately advancing the clinical translation of lipid nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.",

Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles (Walkey et al., 2012). Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution (Zhang et al., 2019)."

                            "Protein corona presents a major obstacle to bench-to-bedside translation of targeted drug delivery systems, severely affecting targeting yields and directing unfavorable biodistribution. Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes. Here, the authors develop bio-inspired liposomes that specifically absorb brain-targeted apolipoproteins and preserve their bioactivities, thereby achieving efficient brain targeting with minor influence on immunocompatibility of liposomes."

[34] Such an observation was supported by earlier studies showing increased uptake by macrophages. [114] It was hypothesized that the recruitment of \u03b22-GPI can be mediated by the inclusion of anionic lipid in the formulation. Successful delivery to the immune cell population was also shown to be associated with a low content of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the protein corona. It was rationalized that ApoE leads to the capture of the particle by the liver through the receptor-dependent pathway, conferring a predominant hepatic tropism. Thus, surface chemistry that resists the adsorption of ApoE might prove a viable strategy for improving immune cell transfection in in vivo."

                            "The substances in biological fluids, especially proteins, will absorb on the surface of NPs and rapidly form an external layer called protein corona through all kinds of nano-bio interactions and biochemical driving forces (Wang et al., 2019). This layer consists of many biomolecules, like albumin, complement protein, and apolipoprotein, which will redefine the \"biological identity\" of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). Not only will the physicochemical properties of NPs change, including size, shape, and surface properties, but also their biological fate and therapeutic effects, such as circulation time, biodistribution, stability, immune system activation, cellular uptake, targeting effect, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity (Cai et al., 2018)[7](Francia et al., 2019). As Yi-Feng Wang et al. indicated, the protein corona will influence the cellular transportation mechanism and intracellular distribution of NPs (Wang et al., 2021). They suggested that the interaction of cationic liposomes with cells would switch from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis under the presence of protein corona. They also found that in serum-free conditions (without protein corona), the NPs are mainly distributed in the nucleus, different from the NPs with serum, which is mainly distributed in lysosomes",
                            "Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona (Lu et al., 2019)."

Here, by taking graphene/gold as examples, we comprehensively assessed the association of surface properties with the protein corona. As revealed by in vitro measurements and computations, the interaction between graphene/gold and HSA/IgE was inversely correlated with the hydroxyl group availability, whereas the interaction between that and ApoE was comparatively less relevant. Molecular simulations revealed that the number and the distribution of surface hydroxyl groups could regulate the manner in which nanomaterials interact with proteins. Moreover, we validated that ApoE pre-adsorption before injection enhances the blood circulation of nanomaterials relative to their pristine and IgE-coated counterparts. This benefit can be attributed to the invulnerability of the complementary system provided by ApoE, whose encasement does not increase cytotoxicity. Overall, this study offers a robust yet simple way to create protein corona enriched in dysopsonins to realize better delivery efficacy. The interaction between proteins and nanomaterials is complex and of interest for controlling nanoparticle fate. Here, using experimental and computational methods, the authors report on the effect of hydroxyl groups on protein interaction and how they can be used to enhance circulation times."

                            "Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been developed for imaging, drug delivery, diagnosis, and clinical therapeutic purposes because of their outstanding physicochemical characteristics. However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clinical application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biology (nano-bio) interactions. The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biological milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biological fluids (biofluids), environments, or biological structures) of nano-bio interactions. The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biological molecules and structures in the biological environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine. Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biological molecules, all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biological outcomes. In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines. In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines. First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, molecular recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biological environment. The physicochemical properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomolecule are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biological functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced. Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equilibrium and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers. Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradiation-induced processes. Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design. We expect our efforts in understanding the nano-bio interaction and the future development of this field will bring nanomedicine to human use more quickly."

                            "Abstract Liposomes, especially cationic liposomes, are the most common and well-investigated nanocarriers for biomedical applications, such as drug and gene delivery. Like other types of nanomaterials, once liposomes are incubated in a biological milieu, their surface can be immediately cloaked by biological components to form a protein corona, which confers a new \u2018biological identity\u2019 and modulates downstream interactions with cells. However, it remains unclear how the protein corona affects the transportation mechanism after liposomes interact with cells. Here, we employed home-made aggregation-induced-emission-visualized nanoliposomes TR4@Lipo as a model to investigate transportation with or without the protein corona by optical imaging techniques. The results show that the protein corona can change the cellular transportation mechanism of TR4@Lipo from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis. The protein corona also modulates the intracellular distribution of loaded cargoes. This knowledge furthers our understanding of bio-nano interactions and is important for the efficient use of cationic liposomes."
