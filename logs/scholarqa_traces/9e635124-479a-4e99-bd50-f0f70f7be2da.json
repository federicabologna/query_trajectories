Nanocarriers hold transformative potential for precise drug delivery within the vascular system, particularly targeting ECs for therapeutic purposes. However, the complex interactions between vascular ECs and nanocarriers present significant challenges for the development and clinical translation of nanotherapeutics. This review assesses recent advancements and key strategies in employing nanocarriers for drug delivery to vascular ECs. It suggested that through precise physicochemical design and surface modifications, nanocarriers can enhance targeting specificity and improve drug internalization efficiency in ECs. Additionally, we elaborated on the applications of nanocarriers specifically designed for targeting ECs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer metastasis, and inflammatory disorders. Despite these advancements, safety concerns, the complexity of in vivo processes, and the challenge of achieving subcellular drug delivery remain significant obstacles to the effective targeting of ECs with nanocarriers. A comprehensive understanding of endothelial cell biology and its interaction with nanocarriers is crucial for realizing the full potential of targeted drug delivery systems. Graphical Abstract",

                    "text": "The emergence of nanomedicine has profoundly impacted the field of precision medicine [2,42]. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems facilitate the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues, thereby improving drug bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [2]. Numerous types of nanocarriers have been developed for drug delivery, including polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and lipid-based nanoparticles [18]. Recent advancements in nanotechnology are focused on overcoming four major biological barriers: pulmonary mucus, gastrointestinal mucus, the placental barrier, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Fig. 1) [12]. Nanocarriers are proficient at surmounting these biological obstacles, thereby enabling efficient drug delivery to targeted sites, which is essential for achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes [1,43]. For example, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier to deliver drugs directly to brain tissue, providing promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease [44]. \n\nNanocarriers exhibit significant potential in drug development, cancer therapy, gene therapy, diagnostic imaging, and vaccine development, thus becoming a central focus of biomedical research [45][46][47]. The nanocarriers composed of alginate and chitosan, demonstrate superior biocompatibility and biodegradability [48]. They are especially effective in delivering anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine [48]. Solid lipid nanocarriers and nanostructured lipid carriers improve therapeutic delivery in skin cancer treatments, enhancing systemic bioavailability and site-specific targeting [43]. Additionally, Zhao et al. proposed a smart spatiotemporal drug release system utilizing multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy of melanoma, which significantly improved tumor imaging and photothermal treatment efficacy in vivo [49]. Furthermore, nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems possess substantial potential in gene therapy [2,50,51].",

Cong, Zebin Zhang, He Li, Yonggang Yang, Yuning Zhang, Tianmeng Sun\n## Abstract\nEndothelial cells (ECs) are pivotal in maintaining vascular health, regulating hemodynamics, and modulating inflammatory responses. Nanocarriers hold transformative potential for precise drug delivery within the vascular system, particularly targeting ECs for therapeutic purposes. However, the complex interactions between vascular ECs and nanocarriers present significant challenges for the development and clinical translation of nanotherapeutics. This review assesses recent advancements and key strategies in employing nanocarriers for drug delivery to vascular ECs. It suggested that through precise physicochemical design and surface modifications, nanocarriers can enhance targeting specificity and improve drug internalization efficiency in ECs. Additionally, we elaborated on the applications of nanocarriers specifically designed for targeting ECs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer metastasis, and inflammatory disorders. Despite these advancements, safety concerns, the complexity of in vivo processes, and the challenge of achieving subcellular drug delivery remain significant obstacles to the effective targeting of ECs with nanocarriers. A comprehensive understanding of endothelial cell biology and its interaction with nanocarriers is crucial for realizing the full potential of targeted drug delivery systems. Graphical Abstract\n## Nanocarriers in drug delivery\nThe emergence of nanomedicine has profoundly impacted the field of precision medicine [2,42]. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems facilitate the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues, thereby improving drug bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [2]. Numerous types of nanocarriers have been developed for drug delivery, including polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and lipid-based nanoparticles [18]. Recent advancements in nanotechnology are focused on overcoming four major biological barriers: pulmonary mucus, gastrointestinal mucus, the placental barrier, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Fig. 1) [12]. Nanocarriers are proficient at surmounting these biological obstacles, thereby enabling efficient drug delivery to targeted sites, which is essential for achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes [1,43]. For example, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier to deliver drugs directly to brain tissue, providing promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease [44]. \n\nNanocarriers exhibit significant potential in drug development, cancer therapy, gene therapy, diagnostic imaging, and vaccine development, thus becoming a central focus of biomedical research [45][46][47]. The nanocarriers composed of alginate and chitosan, demonstrate superior biocompatibility and biodegradability [48]. They are especially effective in delivering anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine [48]. Solid lipid nanocarriers and nanostructured lipid carriers improve therapeutic delivery in skin cancer treatments, enhancing systemic bioavailability and site-specific targeting [43]. Additionally, Zhao et al. proposed a smart spatiotemporal drug release system utilizing multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy of melanoma, which significantly improved tumor imaging and photothermal treatment efficacy in vivo [49]. Furthermore, nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems possess substantial potential in gene therapy [2,50,51].",

            "abstract": "BackgroundDesigning efficient 'vectors', to deliver therapeutics across endothelial barriers, in a controlled manner, remains one of the key goals of drug development. Recently, transcytosis of liposome encapsulated fluorescence marker calcein across a tight cell barrier was studied. The most efficient liposomes were found to be liposomes containing sufficient amount of alkyl phospholipid (APL) perifosine. APLs have similar structure as lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC), since APLs were synthesized as metabolically stable analogues of LPC, which increases endothelial permeability directly by inducing endothelial cell contraction, resulting in formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Since one of the unique properties of lysolipid, containing liposomal formulations is dynamic equilibrium of lysolipids, which are distributed among liposomes, micelles, and free form, such liposomes represent a reservoir of free lysolipids. On the other hand lysolipid containing liposomes also represent a reservoir of an encapsulated hydrophilic drug.Presentation of the hypothesisWe hypothesize that free lysolipids, with highest concentration in vicinity of drug carrying liposomes, compromise endothelial integrity, primarily where concentrations of liposomes is the highest, in a similar manner as LPC, by formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Liposome encapsulated drug, which leaks from liposomes, due to liposome destabilization, caused by lysolipid depletion, can therefore be efficiently transported across the locally compromised endothelial barrier.Testing the hypothesisThis hypothesis could be verified: by measuring binding of perifosine and other lysolipids to albumin and to lysophospholipid receptor (LPL-R) group; formation of stress fibers and subsequent cell contraction; activation of RhoA, and endothelial barrier dysfunction; by a synthesis of other LPC analogues with high critical micellar concentration and measuring their effect on transendothelial permeability in presence and absence of albumin.Implications of the hypothesisWe propose that lysolipid containing liposomal formulations might be used as nonspecific transendothelial transport vector, since leakage of liposome encapsulated active drug occurs simultaneously with the release of the lysolipids. The concentration of the active drug is therefore expected to be the highest at the site of compromised endothelial barrier. By appropriate choice of the lysolipids an endothelial barrier would stay open only for a short time. Use of such liposomes would potentially maximize the delivery of the drug while limiting the passage of toxic substances and pathogens across the endothelial barrier. Combining lysolipid containing liposomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles or a targeting ligand might be required to efficiently localize drug delivery to a disease affected tissue and to avoid endothelial disruption over the entire body.",

Designing efficient 'vectors' (antibodies, protein carriers, viruses, nanoparticles) to deliver therapeutics, especially to the disease-affected brain tissue, in a controlled and non-invasive manner remains one of the key goals of drug development [1]. Careful regulation of material exchange into and out of the brain is essential for the survival of neurons, which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate. This transport is regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. However, it also very efficiently prevents the brain uptake of most therapeutically active compounds. Because of this, many diseases of central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, are undertreated. As a result, various strategies have been developed to improve the access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically necessary concentrations to effectively manage diseases [2,3]. Various drug delivery systems such as: liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles [4], microspheres, nanogels, and bionanocapsules were tested for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS with different efficiancies [5][6][7][8]. Even though transcytosis is often thought to be a selective process, endothelial cells of microvasculature move macromolecular cargo rather nonselectively within the fluid phase of the transport vesicle or by absorption to the vesicle membrane [9]. Using vectors promoting transcytosis in such nonspecific manner can be more widely applied, especially in combination with nanoparticles or liposomes, into which large amounts of a drug can be incorporated [10]. Liposomes seem to be a promising delivery system, which enable high cellular uptake and efficient transcytosis across cellular barriers including the BBB, as their composition can be easily adjusted according to the properties of targeted cells and tissues [11]. It is expected that by a proper choice of liposome composition an efficient transcytosis of liposome entrapped drugs across",

Kokli\u010d, Janez trancar\n## Abstract\nBackgroundDesigning efficient 'vectors', to deliver therapeutics across endothelial barriers, in a controlled manner, remains one of the key goals of drug development. Recently, transcytosis of liposome encapsulated fluorescence marker calcein across a tight cell barrier was studied. The most efficient liposomes were found to be liposomes containing sufficient amount of alkyl phospholipid (APL) perifosine. APLs have similar structure as lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC), since APLs were synthesized as metabolically stable analogues of LPC, which increases endothelial permeability directly by inducing endothelial cell contraction, resulting in formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Since one of the unique properties of lysolipid, containing liposomal formulations is dynamic equilibrium of lysolipids, which are distributed among liposomes, micelles, and free form, such liposomes represent a reservoir of free lysolipids. On the other hand lysolipid containing liposomes also represent a reservoir of an encapsulated hydrophilic drug.Presentation of the hypothesisWe hypothesize that free lysolipids, with highest concentration in vicinity of drug carrying liposomes, compromise endothelial integrity, primarily where concentrations of liposomes is the highest, in a similar manner as LPC, by formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Liposome encapsulated drug, which leaks from liposomes, due to liposome destabilization, caused by lysolipid depletion, can therefore be efficiently transported across the locally compromised endothelial barrier.Testing the hypothesisThis hypothesis could be verified: by measuring binding of perifosine and other lysolipids to albumin and to lysophospholipid receptor (LPL-R) group; formation of stress fibers and subsequent cell contraction; activation of RhoA, and endothelial barrier dysfunction; by a synthesis of other LPC analogues with high critical micellar concentration and measuring their effect on transendothelial permeability in presence and absence of albumin.Implications of the hypothesisWe propose that lysolipid containing liposomal formulations might be used as nonspecific transendothelial transport vector, since leakage of liposome encapsulated active drug occurs simultaneously with the release of the lysolipids. The concentration of the active drug is therefore expected to be the highest at the site of compromised endothelial barrier. By appropriate choice of the lysolipids an endothelial barrier would stay open only for a short time. Use of such liposomes would potentially maximize the delivery of the drug while limiting the passage of toxic substances and pathogens across the endothelial barrier. Combining lysolipid containing liposomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles or a targeting ligand might be required to efficiently localize drug delivery to a disease affected tissue and to avoid endothelial disruption over the entire body.\n## Transendothelial delivery of hydrophilic drugs\nTranscytosis holds a great potential for drug delivery across different endothelial barriers. Designing efficient 'vectors' (antibodies, protein carriers, viruses, nanoparticles) to deliver therapeutics, especially to the disease-affected brain tissue, in a controlled and non-invasive manner remains one of the key goals of drug development [1]. Careful regulation of material exchange into and out of the brain is essential for the survival of neurons, which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate. This transport is regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. However, it also very efficiently prevents the brain uptake of most therapeutically active compounds. Because of this, many diseases of central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, are undertreated. As a result, various strategies have been developed to improve the access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically necessary concentrations to effectively manage diseases [2,3]. Various drug delivery systems such as: liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles [4], microspheres, nanogels, and bionanocapsules were tested for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS with different efficiancies [5][6][7][8]. Even though transcytosis is often thought to be a selective process, endothelial cells of microvasculature move macromolecular cargo rather nonselectively within the fluid phase of the transport vesicle or by absorption to the vesicle membrane [9]. Using vectors promoting transcytosis in such nonspecific manner can be more widely applied, especially in combination with nanoparticles or liposomes, into which large amounts of a drug can be incorporated [10]. Liposomes seem to be a promising delivery system, which enable high cellular uptake and efficient transcytosis across cellular barriers including the BBB, as their composition can be easily adjusted according to the properties of targeted cells and tissues [11]. It is expected that by a proper choice of liposome composition an efficient transcytosis of liposome entrapped drugs across",

They are also classified as nanospheres, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles based upon the dispersion of drug within the nanocarrier. Different types and modifications of nanocarriers have been studied for improved delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The use of nanocarriers can improve brain delivery of ARVs in several ways. Many of the agents delivered are well-established substrates of ABC transporters. These include P-gp substrates, e.g. \n\nNanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" [63]. This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range [64]. This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides [65]. Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models [15,[66][67][68]. These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based. \n\nDendrimers are a versatile class of regularly-branched macromolecules with unique structural and topologic features.",

The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the application of novel drug delivery systems to the delivery of anti-HIV drugs, specifically antiretrovirals. controlled/sustained and targeted/intracellular drug delivery are the important ones for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs which may useful for further research in future.\n## Nanocarriers\nNanocarriers can be classified according to the material used for their manufacture, such as liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and metal nanoparticles. They are also classified as nanospheres, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles based upon the dispersion of drug within the nanocarrier. Different types and modifications of nanocarriers have been studied for improved delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The use of nanocarriers can improve brain delivery of ARVs in several ways. Many of the agents delivered are well-established substrates of ABC transporters. These include P-gp substrates, e.g. \n\nNanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" [63]. This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range [64]. This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides [65]. Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models [15,[66][67][68]. These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based. \n\nDendrimers are a versatile class of regularly-branched macromolecules with unique structural and topologic features.",

Moreover, they can avoid phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, thus improving the concentration of drugs in the brain [41]. Several types of nanoparticles have been studied for the efficient blood-brain barrier crossing, including polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nRecent studies have focused on the use of poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid as a material for the synthesis of nanoparticles to encapsulate therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [42] and brain cancer [43,44]. In vitro studies showed that the use of polymeric nanoparticles enhanced drug delivery to the brain, with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and plaque load through the improved delivery of curcumin for treating Alzheimer's disease [42], and efficient internalization of doxorubicin into the human glioma cells, resulting in cytotoxic effect on cancer cells [43]. Additionally, the in vivo experiment regarding the co-delivery of cisplatin and boldine, an antioxidant agent, using the poly(lactide-co-glycolic) nanocarriers resulted in an effective target-specific delivery for therapeutic use in brain cancer therapy [44]. Furthermore, the use of a positively charged polymer, poly(ethylene imine) [45], and of the poly(ethylene imine)-poly(L-lysine) copolymer [46] as gene delivery vehicles has been reported. To improve the cytocompatibility of poly(ethylene imine), L-glutathione was attached to the backbone of the polymer, which also enhanced the passage through the blood-brain barrier in vitro [45]. Thus, it has been demonstrated the potential of poly(ethylene imine)-based nanoparticles for the delivery of genes for gene therapy in brain cancer [45,46].",

Volceanov, R. Teleanu\n## Abstract\nPathologies of the brain, of which brain cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis, are some of the most prevalent, and that presently are poorly treated due to the difficulties associated with drug development, administration, and targeting to the brain. The existence of the blood-brain barrier, a selective permeability system which acts as a local gateway against circulating foreign substances, represents the key challenge for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. However, the development of nanotechnology-based approaches for brain delivery, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, and carbon nanotubes, might be the solution for improved brain therapies.\n## Polymeric Nanoparticles\nAs nanoparticles possess suitable properties for drug delivery, such as controlled drug release and targeting efficiency, they have been widely used for the development of drug delivery carriers to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, they can avoid phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, thus improving the concentration of drugs in the brain [41]. Several types of nanoparticles have been studied for the efficient blood-brain barrier crossing, including polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nRecent studies have focused on the use of poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid as a material for the synthesis of nanoparticles to encapsulate therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [42] and brain cancer [43,44]. In vitro studies showed that the use of polymeric nanoparticles enhanced drug delivery to the brain, with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and plaque load through the improved delivery of curcumin for treating Alzheimer's disease [42], and efficient internalization of doxorubicin into the human glioma cells, resulting in cytotoxic effect on cancer cells [43]. Additionally, the in vivo experiment regarding the co-delivery of cisplatin and boldine, an antioxidant agent, using the poly(lactide-co-glycolic) nanocarriers resulted in an effective target-specific delivery for therapeutic use in brain cancer therapy [44]. Furthermore, the use of a positively charged polymer, poly(ethylene imine) [45], and of the poly(ethylene imine)-poly(L-lysine) copolymer [46] as gene delivery vehicles has been reported. To improve the cytocompatibility of poly(ethylene imine), L-glutathione was attached to the backbone of the polymer, which also enhanced the passage through the blood-brain barrier in vitro [45]. Thus, it has been demonstrated the potential of poly(ethylene imine)-based nanoparticles for the delivery of genes for gene therapy in brain cancer [45,46].\n\n## Conclusions and Perspectives\nDrug targeting and delivery to the brain represent key challenges due to presence of the blood-brain barrier, which is responsible for the protection of the brain against foreign substances. In order to progress in the effective treatment of brain cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and stroke, which are highly prevalent diseases, novel strategies for the enhanced passage of the blood-brain barrier must be developed. Nanotechnology-based approaches are intensively studied at the moment, including nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, and carbon nanotubes as nanocarriers to overcome the blood-brain barrier and deliver the appropriate amount of drug to the specific brain site. Further research is needed to understand and mediate the blood-brain barrier crossing mechanisms and to improve the efficiency of brain delivery methods using nanotechnology.",

These disorders include stroke, brain cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, neuroinfections, and traumatic disorders of the nervous system, among others (http://www.who.int/en/). Because millions of people worldwide are affected by CNS disorders, they constitute 6.3% of the global burden of disease. In other words, CNS diseases are a huge world of burden of human suffering with negative economic results [1]. Most of the therapeutic molecules cannot attain the brain because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the bloodstream from the cerebral parenchyma [2]. This barrier is mainly composed by endothelial cells, which are linked by tight junctions [3]. The BBB also contains a basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes [3]. More important is the presence of efflux transporters that perform active back-transport of the therapeutic molecules to the blood lumen. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the most important efflux transporter associated to the failure of various therapies to treat CNS diseases [4]. Advances in nanomedicine have created a non-invasive strategy for the management of CNS diseases [5]. This strategy emphasizes on the encapsulation of therapeutic compounds, which are mainly P-gp substrates, in drug delivery systems, also called nanocarriers, such as liposomes, lipid nanocapsules, polymeric nanoparticles, or polymersomes [6][7][8][9][10]. Encapsulation of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems improve their solubility and protect them from the biological environment and circumvent the P-gp at the BBB yielding higher concentrations of the therapeutic compounds in the brain parenchyma [5]. Among nanocarriers, liposomes have been the most studied due to their composition, which makes them biocompatible, biodegradable, and less toxic [11].",

In other words, CNS diseases are a huge world of burden of human suffering with negative economic results [1]. Most of the therapeutic molecules cannot attain the brain because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the bloodstream from the cerebral parenchyma [2]. This barrier is mainly composed by endothelial cells, which are linked by tight junctions [3]. The BBB also contains a basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes [3]. More important is the presence of efflux transporters that perform active back-transport of the therapeutic molecules to the blood lumen. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the most important efflux transporter associated to the failure of various therapies to treat CNS diseases [4]. Advances in nanomedicine have created a non-invasive strategy for the management of CNS diseases [5]. This strategy emphasizes on the encapsulation of therapeutic compounds, which are mainly P-gp substrates, in drug delivery systems, also called nanocarriers, such as liposomes, lipid nanocapsules, polymeric nanoparticles, or polymersomes [6][7][8][9][10]. Encapsulation of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems improve their solubility and protect them from the biological environment and circumvent the P-gp at the BBB yielding higher concentrations of the therapeutic compounds in the brain parenchyma [5]. Among nanocarriers, liposomes have been the most studied due to their composition, which makes them biocompatible, biodegradable, and less toxic [11].",

However, the impermeability of the BBB to drugs is a hurdle for CNS drug development, which hinders the distribution of the most therapeutic molecules into the brain. Therefore, scientists have been striving to develop safe and effective technologies to advance drug penetration into the CNS with higher targeting properties and lower off-targeting side effects. This review will discuss the limitation of artificial nanomedicine in CNS drug delivery and the use of natural extracellular vesicles (EVs), as therapeutic vehicles to achieve targeted delivery to the CNS. Information on clinical trials regarding CNS targeted drug delivery using EVs is very limited. Thus, this review will also briefly highlight the recent clinical studies on targeted drug delivery in the peripheral nervous system to shed light on potential strategies for CNS drug delivery. Different technologies engaged in pre- and post-isolation have been implemented to further utilize and optimize the natural property of EVs. EVs from various sources have also been applied in the engineering of EVs for CNS targeted drug delivery in vitro and in vivo. Here, the future feasibility of those studies in clinic will be discussed.",

However, they are ineffective or achieve suboptimal responses while treating the pathology or symptoms related to the brain [1,2]. The suboptimal therapeutic concentration of drugs in the brain is mainly due to the relative impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to most pharmacological agents [1,2]. The lack of BBB permeability is attributed to both a tight BBB junction and efflux of these drugs, primarily via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [3][4][5]. \n\nNanotechnology has emerged to overcome unmet drug delivery barriers and to achieve site targeted drug delivery. It has contributed substantially to developing nanocarriers to treat various diseases in recent decades [6,7]. In particular, liposomes have attracted much attention in drug encapsulation and delivery, and many lab scale liposome drug preparations have been transformed into clinical formulations [8,9]. These synthetic vesicles are attached to different ligands to aid in the efficient cellular binding, uptake, and intracellular processing required for targeted delivery of the cargo [10,11]. Nevertheless, these ligands on drug carriers can trigger an immune response [12][13][14][15]. Further, the difficulty in the clearance or biodegradation of these nanoparticles (NPs), which could lead to neurotoxicity, limits their use as drug delivery vehicles [16][17][18]. \n\nRecently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) started emerging as a natural carrier system for the delivery of therapeutics [19,20]. EVs, nano-sized membranous vesicles, are released by many types of cells. The natural biocompatibility, stability, permeability across several natural barriers, as well as their inherent homing aptitudes facilitates EVs' potential for targeted therapeutic drug delivery [21,22].",

Thomas-Gooch, Asit Kumar, B. Raji, Kaining Zhi, H. Kochat, Santosh Kumar\n## Abstract\nThe blood brain barrier (BBB) maintains the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) and protects the brain from toxic substances present in the circulating blood. However, the impermeability of the BBB to drugs is a hurdle for CNS drug development, which hinders the distribution of the most therapeutic molecules into the brain. Therefore, scientists have been striving to develop safe and effective technologies to advance drug penetration into the CNS with higher targeting properties and lower off-targeting side effects. This review will discuss the limitation of artificial nanomedicine in CNS drug delivery and the use of natural extracellular vesicles (EVs), as therapeutic vehicles to achieve targeted delivery to the CNS. Information on clinical trials regarding CNS targeted drug delivery using EVs is very limited. Thus, this review will also briefly highlight the recent clinical studies on targeted drug delivery in the peripheral nervous system to shed light on potential strategies for CNS drug delivery. Different technologies engaged in pre- and post-isolation have been implemented to further utilize and optimize the natural property of EVs. EVs from various sources have also been applied in the engineering of EVs for CNS targeted drug delivery in vitro and in vivo. Here, the future feasibility of those studies in clinic will be discussed.\n## Introduction\nThe majority of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO)-approved drugs effectively treat the peripheral pathology or symptoms of a disease. However, they are ineffective or achieve suboptimal responses while treating the pathology or symptoms related to the brain [1,2]. The suboptimal therapeutic concentration of drugs in the brain is mainly due to the relative impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to most pharmacological agents [1,2]. The lack of BBB permeability is attributed to both a tight BBB junction and efflux of these drugs, primarily via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [3][4][5]. \n\nNanotechnology has emerged to overcome unmet drug delivery barriers and to achieve site targeted drug delivery. It has contributed substantially to developing nanocarriers to treat various diseases in recent decades [6,7]. In particular, liposomes have attracted much attention in drug encapsulation and delivery, and many lab scale liposome drug preparations have been transformed into clinical formulations [8,9]. These synthetic vesicles are attached to different ligands to aid in the efficient cellular binding, uptake, and intracellular processing required for targeted delivery of the cargo [10,11]. Nevertheless, these ligands on drug carriers can trigger an immune response [12][13][14][15]. Further, the difficulty in the clearance or biodegradation of these nanoparticles (NPs), which could lead to neurotoxicity, limits their use as drug delivery vehicles [16][17][18]. \n\nRecently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) started emerging as a natural carrier system for the delivery of therapeutics [19,20]. EVs, nano-sized membranous vesicles, are released by many types of cells. The natural biocompatibility, stability, permeability across several natural barriers, as well as their inherent homing aptitudes facilitates EVs' potential for targeted therapeutic drug delivery [21,22].",

            "abstract": "Our brain is protected by physio-biological barriers. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) main mechanism of protection relates to the abundance of tight junctions (TJs) and efflux pumps. Although BBB is crucial for healthy brain protection against toxins, it also leads to failure in a devastating disease like brain cancer. Recently, nanocarriers have been shown to pass through the BBB and improve patients\u2019 survival rates, thus becoming promising treatment strategies. Among nanocarriers, inorganic nanocarriers, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, polymers, micelles, and dendrimers have reached clinical trials after delivering promising results in preclinical investigations. The size of these nanocarriers is between 10 and 1000\u2005nm and is modified by surface attachment of proteins, peptides, antibodies, or surfactants. Multiple research groups have reported transcellular entrance as the main mechanism allowing for these nanocarriers to cross BBB. Transport proteins and transcellular lipophilic pathways exist in BBB for small and lipophilic molecules. Nanocarriers cannot enter via the paracellular route, which is limited to water-soluble agents due to the TJs and their small pore size. There are currently several nanocarriers in clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer. This article reviews challenges as well as fitting attributes of nanocarriers for brain tumor treatment in preclinical and clinical studies.",

Assuming that blood capillaries and cells range between 6 to 9 and 10 to 20 \u03bcm, respectively, almost all types of nano-drug delivery systems can reach and deliver therapeutics into organs and cells. ][26][27] This study aims to discuss the challenges regarding brain tumor treatment and to review the current application of nanotechnology in preclinical and clinical studies for this disease category. With careful examination of the literature, the physiological and biological aspects of the BBB were summarized along with the nanodrug delivery strategies that have been reviewed in detail based on the nanostructures. Finally, the majority of all ongoing nanodrug delivery systems which have made their way through the clinical trials were reviewed as the realistic perspective of nanomedicine for brain cancer drug delivery systems.",

Badiee, Leila Arabi, Seyedeh Hoda Alavizadeh, Seyedeh Alia Moosavian, Mahmoud Reza Jaafari\n## Abstract\nOur brain is protected by physio-biological barriers. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) main mechanism of protection relates to the abundance of tight junctions (TJs) and efflux pumps. Although BBB is crucial for healthy brain protection against toxins, it also leads to failure in a devastating disease like brain cancer. Recently, nanocarriers have been shown to pass through the BBB and improve patients\u2019 survival rates, thus becoming promising treatment strategies. Among nanocarriers, inorganic nanocarriers, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, polymers, micelles, and dendrimers have reached clinical trials after delivering promising results in preclinical investigations. The size of these nanocarriers is between 10 and 1000\u2005nm and is modified by surface attachment of proteins, peptides, antibodies, or surfactants. Multiple research groups have reported transcellular entrance as the main mechanism allowing for these nanocarriers to cross BBB. Transport proteins and transcellular lipophilic pathways exist in BBB for small and lipophilic molecules. Nanocarriers cannot enter via the paracellular route, which is limited to water-soluble agents due to the TJs and their small pore size. There are currently several nanocarriers in clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer. This article reviews challenges as well as fitting attributes of nanocarriers for brain tumor treatment in preclinical and clinical studies.\n## Introduction\nBased on the drug-loading methods and nanoparticle surface, size, and zeta potential modifications, the effector molecules can be encapsulated, adsorbed, or attached to the nano-drug delivery system. To date, the most successful nanocarriers based on clinical trials are inorganic nanoparticles (such as metal, metal oxide, carbon, and silica particles), liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, and polymers. Assuming that blood capillaries and cells range between 6 to 9 and 10 to 20 \u03bcm, respectively, almost all types of nano-drug delivery systems can reach and deliver therapeutics into organs and cells. ][26][27] This study aims to discuss the challenges regarding brain tumor treatment and to review the current application of nanotechnology in preclinical and clinical studies for this disease category. With careful examination of the literature, the physiological and biological aspects of the BBB were summarized along with the nanodrug delivery strategies that have been reviewed in detail based on the nanostructures. Finally, the majority of all ongoing nanodrug delivery systems which have made their way through the clinical trials were reviewed as the realistic perspective of nanomedicine for brain cancer drug delivery systems.",

            "abstract": "For brain protection, the blood\u2013brain barrier and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier limit the traffic of molecules between blood and brain tissue and between blood and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Besides their protective function, brain barriers also limit the passage of therapeutic drugs to the brain, which constitutes a great challenge for the development of therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. This problem has led to the emergence of novel strategies to treat neurological disorders, like the development of nanoformulations to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, functional molecular clocks have been identified in the blood\u2013brain barrier and in the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In fact, circadian rhythms in physiological functions related to drug disposition were also described in brain barriers.

Albuquerque, A. Neves, C. Santos, Diana Costa, T. Quintela\n## Abstract\nFor brain protection, the blood\u2013brain barrier and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier limit the traffic of molecules between blood and brain tissue and between blood and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Besides their protective function, brain barriers also limit the passage of therapeutic drugs to the brain, which constitutes a great challenge for the development of therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. This problem has led to the emergence of novel strategies to treat neurological disorders, like the development of nanoformulations to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, functional molecular clocks have been identified in the blood\u2013brain barrier and in the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In fact, circadian rhythms in physiological functions related to drug disposition were also described in brain barriers. This opens the possibility for chronobiological approaches that aim to use time to improve drug efficacy and safety. The conjugation of nanoformulations with chronobiology for neurological disorders is still unexplored. Facing this, here, we reviewed the circadian rhythms in brain barriers, the nanoformulations studied to deliver drugs to the brain, and the nanoformulations with the potential to be conjugated with a chronobiological approach to therapeutic strategies for the brain.\n## Nanoformulations as Therapy for Central Nervous System Diseases\nAdditionally, NP surfaces can be functionalized with specific moieties for targeted delivery to a region of interest [106]. Indeed, one of the main advantages is the potential to optimize nanoparticle design through size, shape, and surface modifications to improve interaction and diffusion through cells and tissues. There is also the possibility of conjugating two or more therapeutic compounds for combination therapy, including nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, and anticancer drugs [107]. \n\nFor brain targeting, some requirements must be met: non-toxicity, small size, biocompatibility, high targeting efficiency, long and stable blood circulation, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and biodegradability.

                    "text": "Nanotechnology in drug delivery is categorized into two approaches: direct nanonization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or the drug itself, and encapsulation of the drug within nanocarriers. Utilizing the ultra-small scale of nanoparticles allows drugs to overcome physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and nasal transport barriers, offering novel administration routes. Nanocarriers, with their large surface area and ease of surface modification, can be attached with numerous functional groups, facilitating enhanced cellular entry and therapeutic efficacy, thus improving drug delivery efficiency. 91,92 or instance, nasal drug delivery systems utilizing materials such as liposomes and nanoemulsions, enhanced for mucosal penetration, can improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, significantly enhancing mucosal diffusion and absorption, 93 thereby making nasal delivery more efficient as demonstrated in Figure 3A. This innovation provides new pathways and therapeutic methods in clinical medicine.Direct nanonization of drugs typically involves passive diffusion and unsaturated transport primarily through the pores of capillary endothelial cells. In contrast, the application of nanocarriers primarily utilizes receptor-mediated transport and adsorption-mediated transport under electric charge, constituting saturated transport methods to breach the BBB. 94 For example, Sun et al 95 developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, Lu et al 96 found that cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles exhibited an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts, as depicted in Figure 3B.",

We explore various nanoscale drug delivery systems (NDDSs), including lipid-based, polymer-based, nanoemulsions, nanogels, and inorganic carriers. These systems offer improved drug efficacy, targeting, and reduced side effects. Emphasizing the crucial role of nanoparticle size and surface modifications, the review discusses the advancements in NDDSs for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Challenges such as production cost and safety are acknowledged, yet the potential of NDDSs in transforming drug delivery methods is highlighted. This contribution underscores the importance of nanotechnology in pharmaceutical engineering, suggesting it as a significant advancement for medical applications and patient care.\n## Mechanisms of Nanomedicine Drug Delivery Systems for Improving Solubility of Poorly Soluble Drugs Nanotechnology\nNanotechnology in drug delivery is categorized into two approaches: direct nanonization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or the drug itself, and encapsulation of the drug within nanocarriers. Utilizing the ultra-small scale of nanoparticles allows drugs to overcome physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and nasal transport barriers, offering novel administration routes. Nanocarriers, with their large surface area and ease of surface modification, can be attached with numerous functional groups, facilitating enhanced cellular entry and therapeutic efficacy, thus improving drug delivery efficiency. 91,92 or instance, nasal drug delivery systems utilizing materials such as liposomes and nanoemulsions, enhanced for mucosal penetration, can improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, significantly enhancing mucosal diffusion and absorption, 93 thereby making nasal delivery more efficient as demonstrated in Figure 3A. This innovation provides new pathways and therapeutic methods in clinical medicine.Direct nanonization of drugs typically involves passive diffusion and unsaturated transport primarily through the pores of capillary endothelial cells. In contrast, the application of nanocarriers primarily utilizes receptor-mediated transport and adsorption-mediated transport under electric charge, constituting saturated transport methods to breach the BBB. 94 For example, Sun et al 95 developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, Lu et al 96 found that cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles exhibited an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts, as depicted in Figure 3B.",

The brain is protected by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by the endothelial cells of the cerebral microvessels, which at the same time acts as a bottleneck for drug delivery by preventing the vast majority of drugs to reach the brain. To overcome this obstacle, drugs can be loaded inside nanoparticles that can carry the drug through the BBB. However, not all particles are able to cross the BBB and a multitude of factors needs to be taken into account when developing a carrier system for this purpose. Depending on the chosen pathway to cross the BBB, nanoparticle material, size and surface properties such as functionalization and charge should be tailored to fit the specific route of BBB crossing.",

                    "text": "Crossing the BBB remains one of the most challenging tasks for drug delivery to the brain. Different physiological pathways can be employed for crossing the BBB including receptor-mediated transcytosis or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. To reach this goal, a multitude of nanocarrier systems, such as polymeric, lipid-based or inorganic nanoparticles, have been developed and shown able to cross the BBB owing to their tailored surface properties. In numerous studies, the physical coating of nanoparticles with surfactants and the chemical functionalization with specific ligands have been proven to be successful strategies to enhance the BBB crossing through RMT or AMT. Size and charge of the nanoparticles are also aspects that can influence their penetration into the brain. Smaller nanoparticles are able to cross the BBB more easily and to diffuse better through the brain. However, bigger nanoparticles, if correctly functionalized, are also able to cross the BBB, although to a slightly lower extent. Thus, key to increase the amount of drug delivered to the brain is finding the optimal particle size. Larger particles can be loaded with larger amounts of drugs but will reach the brain in lower concentrations, smaller nanoparticles cannot contain large amounts of API but will reach the brain in higher concentrations. By rationally designing nanoparticle systems, the crossing of the BBB in preclinical studies has been successfully demonstrated repeatedly. However, very few clinical data are available on the efficacy of these strategies in the human body. More efforts should now be taken to accelerate the translation of these results into clinical stages, for instance, by focusing on the behavior of the nanoparticles in human blood and investigating the protein corona forming around them, by investigating the particle-cell interactions or by looking for biomimetic solutions. \n\nFigure 2",

Lombardo, Marc Schneider, A. T\u00fcreli, Nazende G\u00fcnday T\u00fcreli\n## Abstract\nCentral nervous system diseases are a heavy burden on society and health care systems. Hence, the delivery of drugs to the brain has gained more and more interest. The brain is protected by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by the endothelial cells of the cerebral microvessels, which at the same time acts as a bottleneck for drug delivery by preventing the vast majority of drugs to reach the brain. To overcome this obstacle, drugs can be loaded inside nanoparticles that can carry the drug through the BBB. However, not all particles are able to cross the BBB and a multitude of factors needs to be taken into account when developing a carrier system for this purpose. Depending on the chosen pathway to cross the BBB, nanoparticle material, size and surface properties such as functionalization and charge should be tailored to fit the specific route of BBB crossing.\n## Conclusion\nCrossing the BBB remains one of the most challenging tasks for drug delivery to the brain. Different physiological pathways can be employed for crossing the BBB including receptor-mediated transcytosis or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. To reach this goal, a multitude of nanocarrier systems, such as polymeric, lipid-based or inorganic nanoparticles, have been developed and shown able to cross the BBB owing to their tailored surface properties. In numerous studies, the physical coating of nanoparticles with surfactants and the chemical functionalization with specific ligands have been proven to be successful strategies to enhance the BBB crossing through RMT or AMT. Size and charge of the nanoparticles are also aspects that can influence their penetration into the brain. Smaller nanoparticles are able to cross the BBB more easily and to diffuse better through the brain. However, bigger nanoparticles, if correctly functionalized, are also able to cross the BBB, although to a slightly lower extent. Thus, key to increase the amount of drug delivered to the brain is finding the optimal particle size. Larger particles can be loaded with larger amounts of drugs but will reach the brain in lower concentrations, smaller nanoparticles cannot contain large amounts of API but will reach the brain in higher concentrations. By rationally designing nanoparticle systems, the crossing of the BBB in preclinical studies has been successfully demonstrated repeatedly. However, very few clinical data are available on the efficacy of these strategies in the human body. More efforts should now be taken to accelerate the translation of these results into clinical stages, for instance, by focusing on the behavior of the nanoparticles in human blood and investigating the protein corona forming around them, by investigating the particle-cell interactions or by looking for biomimetic solutions. \n\nFigure 2",

Nevertheless, as research progressed, EVs were found to stably carry important signaling molecules such as proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and lipids, which have important roles in intercellular communication [15,16], disease diagnosis [17][18][19], disease development [20,21], and disease therapy [22,23].",

Yet, it represents one of the most difficult and complicated routes. Accordingly, scientists are in a continuous search for novel drug delivery vehicles such as the lipid and polymeric nanoparticles that are apt to enhance the bioavailability of the administered drugs to reach the brain. In this study, a certain number of publications were selected from different databases and literature. Meta-analysis studies using two different algorithms (DerSimonian\u2013Laird and inverse variance) followed aiming to explore the published studies and confirm by evidence the superiority of nanocarriers in enhancing the brain bioavailability of various drugs. Furthermore, the quantitative comparison of lipid versus polymeric nanosystems was performed. Methods: The area under the curve (AUC) as an important pharmacokinetic parameter extracted from in vivo animal studies was designated as the \u201ceffect\u201d in the performed meta-analysis after normalization. Forest plots were generated. Key findings and Conclusions: The meta-analysis confirmed the augmentation of the AUC after the comparison with traditional preparations such as solutions and suspensions. Most importantly, lipid nanoparticles were proven to be significantly superior to the polymeric counterparts.",

                    "text": "Several drug delivery researchers and formulators have attempted the nose-to-brain drug delivery as it offers several merits and advantages. The ease of administration, noninvasiveness, proximity to the target organ (the brain), and many other benefits such as the circumvention of one of the hardest barriers for drugs to penetrate, viz. the blood-brain barrier, together with the first-pass effect (liver metabolism) avoidance [1,2] are among the most important pros of this route of administration. The last two aforementioned advantages specifically lead to a remarkable increase in the drug brain bioavailability compared with other conventional pathways of drug administration such as the oral and intravenous routes [3]. \n\nTo enhance drug absorption and permeability through the nasal mucosa and bloodbrain barrier, several attempts have been adopted. Among these attempts are the use of permeation enhancers and drug nanocarriers. The correct selection of the nanoparticulate materials can provide a very successful means of delivering the drug molecule to the brain via the nose. Exploiting the trigeminal and olfactory nerves for the nose-to-brain delivery warrants the usage of several hydrophobic or amphiphilic nanosystems such as the solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid nanocapsules, liposomes, microemulsions, PLGA, Pullulan and chitosan polymeric nanoparticles, and gelatin as protein nanocarriers [4][5][6]. \n\nFurthermore, the controlled manner of delivery of drugs currently poses a subject of high significance at both the industrial and academic levels due to its great benefits in the therapy of serious diseases [7][8][9][10]. In a previous and recent meta-analysis study, lipid-based nanosystems were proven to be more capable of increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs after the comparison with conventional systems and formulations [11]. More recently, the use of polymeric nanoparticles was also proven to significantly increase the bioavailability of the aforementioned drugs despite its different nature and chemical structure [12]. Regarding the nose-to-brain delivery, both carrier types have their pros and cons.",

El-Marakby\n## Abstract\nObjectives: The intranasal route represents a high promising route of administration aiming for brain delivery. Yet, it represents one of the most difficult and complicated routes. Accordingly, scientists are in a continuous search for novel drug delivery vehicles such as the lipid and polymeric nanoparticles that are apt to enhance the bioavailability of the administered drugs to reach the brain. In this study, a certain number of publications were selected from different databases and literature. Meta-analysis studies using two different algorithms (DerSimonian\u2013Laird and inverse variance) followed aiming to explore the published studies and confirm by evidence the superiority of nanocarriers in enhancing the brain bioavailability of various drugs. Furthermore, the quantitative comparison of lipid versus polymeric nanosystems was performed. Methods: The area under the curve (AUC) as an important pharmacokinetic parameter extracted from in vivo animal studies was designated as the \u201ceffect\u201d in the performed meta-analysis after normalization. Forest plots were generated. Key findings and Conclusions: The meta-analysis confirmed the augmentation of the AUC after the comparison with traditional preparations such as solutions and suspensions. Most importantly, lipid nanoparticles were proven to be significantly superior to the polymeric counterparts.\n## Introduction\nSeveral drug delivery researchers and formulators have attempted the nose-to-brain drug delivery as it offers several merits and advantages. The ease of administration, noninvasiveness, proximity to the target organ (the brain), and many other benefits such as the circumvention of one of the hardest barriers for drugs to penetrate, viz. the blood-brain barrier, together with the first-pass effect (liver metabolism) avoidance [1,2] are among the most important pros of this route of administration. The last two aforementioned advantages specifically lead to a remarkable increase in the drug brain bioavailability compared with other conventional pathways of drug administration such as the oral and intravenous routes [3]. \n\nTo enhance drug absorption and permeability through the nasal mucosa and bloodbrain barrier, several attempts have been adopted. Among these attempts are the use of permeation enhancers and drug nanocarriers. The correct selection of the nanoparticulate materials can provide a very successful means of delivering the drug molecule to the brain via the nose. Exploiting the trigeminal and olfactory nerves for the nose-to-brain delivery warrants the usage of several hydrophobic or amphiphilic nanosystems such as the solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid nanocapsules, liposomes, microemulsions, PLGA, Pullulan and chitosan polymeric nanoparticles, and gelatin as protein nanocarriers [4][5][6]. \n\nFurthermore, the controlled manner of delivery of drugs currently poses a subject of high significance at both the industrial and academic levels due to its great benefits in the therapy of serious diseases [7][8][9][10]. In a previous and recent meta-analysis study, lipid-based nanosystems were proven to be more capable of increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs after the comparison with conventional systems and formulations [11]. More recently, the use of polymeric nanoparticles was also proven to significantly increase the bioavailability of the aforementioned drugs despite its different nature and chemical structure [12]. Regarding the nose-to-brain delivery, both carrier types have their pros and cons.",

Tan, Jialiu Zeng, Chih Hung Lo\n## Abstract\nOvercoming the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant hurdle in effective drug delivery to the brain. While the BBB serves as a crucial protective barrier, it poses challenges in delivering therapeutic agents to their intended targets within the brain parenchyma. To enhance drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, several delivery technologies to circumvent the BBB have been developed in the last few years. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most versatile and promising tools. Here, we summarize the characteristics of NPs that facilitate BBB penetration, including their size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and importantly, their conjugation with various biological or synthetic molecules such as glucose, transferrin, insulin, polyethylene glycol, peptides, and aptamers. Additionally, we discuss the coating of NPs with surfactants. A comprehensive overview of the common in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB for NP penetration studies is also provided. The discussion extends to discussing BBB impairment under pathological conditions and leveraging BBB alterations under pathological conditions to enhance drug delivery. Emphasizing the need for future studies to uncover the inherent therapeutic properties of NPs, the review advocates for their role beyond delivery systems and calls for efforts translating NPs to the clinic as therapeutics. Overall, NPs stand out as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for precise BBB targeting and drug delivery in neurological disorders.\n",

Despite the significant advancement in drug development technology with emerging biopharmaceuticals like gene therapy or recombinant protein, the clinical translational rate of such biopharmaceuticals to treat CNS disease is extremely poor. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which separates the brain from blood and protects the CNS microenvironment to maintain essential neuronal functions, poses the greatest challenge for CNS drug delivery. Many strategies have been developed over the years which include local disruption of BBB via physical and chemical methods, and drug transport across BBB via transcytosis by targeting some endogenous proteins expressed on brain-capillary. Drug delivery to brain is an ever-evolving topic, although there were multiple review articles in literature, an update is warranted due to continued growth and new innovations of research on this topic. Thus, this review is an attempt to highlight the recent strategies employed to overcome challenges of CNS drug delivery while emphasizing the necessity of investing more efforts in CNS drug delivery technologies parallel to drug development.",

                    "text": "Bioinspired carriers such as blood cells, cell-membrane-coated nanocarriers, exosomes, etc., are being explored recently for drug delivery across BBB due to their longer circulation life and biocompatibility [79]. Leukocytes such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils are most explored for brain delivery due to their inherent chemotactic recruitment property, especially brain diseases with inflammation. In such methods, drugs are first loaded in nanocarriers which are then incorporated into cells to facilitate delivery across the BBB. For instance, Xue et al. have used neutrophils to deliver paclitaxel loaded liposomes in residual tissue post-surgery which have suppressed the recurrence of glioma growth [166]. To treat ischemic stroke, Xu et al. have developed a 'nanoplatelet' by coating a neuroprotective agent loaded dextran-based nanocarrier with platelet membrane surface-engineered with thrombin-responsive anti-ischemic drug and TAT peptide. This 'nanoplatelet' crosses the BBB, clears the thrombus clog at the ischemic site in the brain and delivers neuroprotective agent to combat ischemic stroke [167]. In another study, to combat encephalitis Yuan et al. have utilized a macrophage-derived exosome for delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to inflamed brain [168]. Such BDNF-loaded exosomes crosses BBB via intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) which is upregulated under encephalitis-related inflammation. However, cell-based carriers suffer from some common limitations such as viability of cell-based carriers arising due to leaching of drug from nanocarriers. In addition, there are some cell-specific limitations like risk of immune activation while using leukocytes or activation of platelets while using it as drug carrier that may cause undesired thrombosis or bleeding. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles which show ~0.5% passive brain accumulation and have attracted attention for drug delivery to brain and treating neurological conditions.",

Despite the significant advancement in drug development technology with emerging biopharmaceuticals like gene therapy or recombinant protein, the clinical translational rate of such biopharmaceuticals to treat CNS disease is extremely poor. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which separates the brain from blood and protects the CNS microenvironment to maintain essential neuronal functions, poses the greatest challenge for CNS drug delivery. Many strategies have been developed over the years which include local disruption of BBB via physical and chemical methods, and drug transport across BBB via transcytosis by targeting some endogenous proteins expressed on brain-capillary. Drug delivery to brain is an ever-evolving topic, although there were multiple review articles in literature, an update is warranted due to continued growth and new innovations of research on this topic. Thus, this review is an attempt to highlight the recent strategies employed to overcome challenges of CNS drug delivery while emphasizing the necessity of investing more efforts in CNS drug delivery technologies parallel to drug development.\n## Cell-Based Biomimetic Strategy of BBB Crossing\nBioinspired carriers such as blood cells, cell-membrane-coated nanocarriers, exosomes, etc., are being explored recently for drug delivery across BBB due to their longer circulation life and biocompatibility [79]. Leukocytes such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils are most explored for brain delivery due to their inherent chemotactic recruitment property, especially brain diseases with inflammation. In such methods, drugs are first loaded in nanocarriers which are then incorporated into cells to facilitate delivery across the BBB. For instance, Xue et al. have used neutrophils to deliver paclitaxel (E) Schematic for potential simultaneous delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic payload to the brain using MENP-liposome composed of a lipid coating embedded with hydrophobic drug onto the hydrophilic drug-loaded MENP. Adopted with permission from Refs. [148,157,158,161].\n...\nBioinspired carriers such as blood cells, cell-membrane-coated nanocarriers, exosomes, etc., are being explored recently for drug delivery across BBB due to their longer circulation life and biocompatibility [79]. Leukocytes such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils are most explored for brain delivery due to their inherent chemotactic recruitment property, especially brain diseases with inflammation. In such methods, drugs are first loaded in nanocarriers which are then incorporated into cells to facilitate delivery across the BBB. For instance, Xue et al. have used neutrophils to deliver paclitaxel loaded liposomes in residual tissue post-surgery which have suppressed the recurrence of glioma growth [166]. To treat ischemic stroke, Xu et al. have developed a 'nanoplatelet' by coating a neuroprotective agent loaded dextran-based nanocarrier with platelet membrane surface-engineered with thrombin-responsive anti-ischemic drug and TAT peptide. This 'nanoplatelet' crosses the BBB, clears the thrombus clog at the ischemic site in the brain and delivers neuroprotective agent to combat ischemic stroke [167]. In another study, to combat encephalitis Yuan et al. have utilized a macrophage-derived exosome for delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to inflamed brain [168]. Such BDNF-loaded exosomes crosses BBB via intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) which is upregulated under encephalitis-related inflammation. However, cell-based carriers suffer from some common limitations such as viability of cell-based carriers arising due to leaching of drug from nanocarriers. In addition, there are some cell-specific limitations like risk of immune activation while using leukocytes or activation of platelets while using it as drug carrier that may cause undesired thrombosis or bleeding. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles which show ~0.5% passive brain accumulation and have attracted attention for drug delivery to brain and treating neurological conditions.",

            "abstract": "Nanocarriers (NCs) are promising tools to improve drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) for more effective treatment of brain disorders, although there is a scarcity of clinical translation of brain-directed NCs. In order to drive the development of brain-oriented NCs toward clinical success, it is essential to understand the prerequisites for nanodelivery to be successful in brain treatment. In this Perspective, we present how pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), formulation and nanotoxicity factors impact the therapeutic success of brain-specific nanodelivery. Properties including high loading efficiency, slow in vivo drug release, long systemic circulation, an increase in unbound brain-to-plasma concentration/exposure ratio (Kp,uu,brain), high drug potency, and minimal nanotoxicity are prerequisites that should preferably be combined to maximize the therapeutic potential of a brain-targeted NC. The PK of brain-directed NCs needs to be evaluated in a more therapeutically relevant manner, focusing on the released, unbound drug. It is more crucial to increase the Kp,uu,brain than to improve the ability of the NC to cross the BBB in its intact form. Brain-targeted NCs, which are mostly developed for treating brain tumors, including metastases, should aim to enhance drug delivery not just to tumor regions with disrupted BBB, but equally important to regions with intact BBB where the drugs themselves have problems reaching. This article provides critical insights into how a brain-targeted nanoformulation needs to be designed and optimized to achieve therapeutic success in the brain.",

                    "text": "Chronic and acute central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation, primary and metastatic brain tumors, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, etc., represent a growing medical problem globally. 1,2 To date, it remains very challenging to achieve effective treatment for these diseases, owing to the presence of the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB), which efficiently regulates the transport of endogenous and exogenous molecules between blood and brain. 3,4 Due to the tight junctions between the brain capillary endothelial cells and the extensively expressed efflux transporters, the BBB plays a pivotal role in protecting the CNS, preventing blood-derived toxic molecules from reaching the brain. 5,6 However, this protective nature of the BBB also poses an enormous challenge to neurotherapeutic agents, limiting their access to the brain targets at effective concentrations. \n\nThe limited success in developing BBB-penetrating drugs has promoted the innovation of various strategies to improve brain drug delivery. Among these strategies, nanocarriers (NCs), e.g., liposome, nanoparticle, micelle, nanoemulsion, nanocrystal, and dendrimer, have emerged as promising approaches that have received increasing research attention from both academia and pharmaceutical industry. 7,8 Although many nanoformulations for non-CNS therapies are widely used in clinical practice, clinical development of brain-directed nanoformulations is considerably lagging behind with no clinically approved CNS nanomedicines to date. 2,9 Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials of NCs specifically for CNS indications only account for 4% of the total numbers of trials of NCs (data extracted in August 2020) (Table 1). Together, these facts imply that current nanodelivery approaches may be inefficient in surmounting the BBB to an extent that significantly improves the therapeutic index compared to the drug itself.",

Hammarlund-Udenaes\n## Abstract\nNanocarriers (NCs) are promising tools to improve drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) for more effective treatment of brain disorders, although there is a scarcity of clinical translation of brain-directed NCs. In order to drive the development of brain-oriented NCs toward clinical success, it is essential to understand the prerequisites for nanodelivery to be successful in brain treatment. In this Perspective, we present how pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), formulation and nanotoxicity factors impact the therapeutic success of brain-specific nanodelivery. Properties including high loading efficiency, slow in vivo drug release, long systemic circulation, an increase in unbound brain-to-plasma concentration/exposure ratio (Kp,uu,brain), high drug potency, and minimal nanotoxicity are prerequisites that should preferably be combined to maximize the therapeutic potential of a brain-targeted NC. The PK of brain-directed NCs needs to be evaluated in a more therapeutically relevant manner, focusing on the released, unbound drug. It is more crucial to increase the Kp,uu,brain than to improve the ability of the NC to cross the BBB in its intact form. Brain-targeted NCs, which are mostly developed for treating brain tumors, including metastases, should aim to enhance drug delivery not just to tumor regions with disrupted BBB, but equally important to regions with intact BBB where the drugs themselves have problems reaching. This article provides critical insights into how a brain-targeted nanoformulation needs to be designed and optimized to achieve therapeutic success in the brain.\n## \u25a0 INTRODUCTION\nChronic and acute central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation, primary and metastatic brain tumors, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, etc., represent a growing medical problem globally. 1,2 To date, it remains very challenging to achieve effective treatment for these diseases, owing to the presence of the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB), which efficiently regulates the transport of endogenous and exogenous molecules between blood and brain. 3,4 Due to the tight junctions between the brain capillary endothelial cells and the extensively expressed efflux transporters, the BBB plays a pivotal role in protecting the CNS, preventing blood-derived toxic molecules from reaching the brain. 5,6 However, this protective nature of the BBB also poses an enormous challenge to neurotherapeutic agents, limiting their access to the brain targets at effective concentrations. \n\nThe limited success in developing BBB-penetrating drugs has promoted the innovation of various strategies to improve brain drug delivery. Among these strategies, nanocarriers (NCs), e.g., liposome, nanoparticle, micelle, nanoemulsion, nanocrystal, and dendrimer, have emerged as promising approaches that have received increasing research attention from both academia and pharmaceutical industry. 7,8 Although many nanoformulations for non-CNS therapies are widely used in clinical practice, clinical development of brain-directed nanoformulations is considerably lagging behind with no clinically approved CNS nanomedicines to date. 2,9 Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials of NCs specifically for CNS indications only account for 4% of the total numbers of trials of NCs (data extracted in August 2020) (Table 1). Together, these facts imply that current nanodelivery approaches may be inefficient in surmounting the BBB to an extent that significantly improves the therapeutic index compared to the drug itself.",

Recently, we showed the allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib (MEK162) to inhibit cell proliferation and to enhance the effect of radiation in preclinical human GBM models. Because the free drug cannot pass the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), we investigated the use of nanocarriers for transport of the drug through the BBB and its efficacy when combined with radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) in glioma spheroids. Methods In vitro studies were performed using multicellular U87 human GBM spheroids. Polymeric nanocarriers (polymersomes) were loaded with MEK162. The interaction between nanocarrier delivered MEK162, irradiation and TMZ was studied on the kinetics of spheroid growth and on protein expression in the MAPK/ERK pathway. BBB passaging was evaluated in a transwell system with human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells. Results MEK162 loaded polymersomes inhibited spheroid growth. A synergistic effect was found in combination with fractionated irradiation and an additive effect with TMZ on spheroid volume reduction. Fluorescent labeled polymersomes were taken up by human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and passed the BBB in vitro. Conclusion MEK162 loaded polymersomes are taken up by multicellular spheroids. The nanocarrier delivered drug reduced spheroid growth and inhibited its molecular target. MEK162 delivered via polymersomes showed interaction with irradiation and TMZ. The polymersomes crossed the in vitro BBB model and therewith offer exciting challenges ahead for delivery of therapeutics agents to brain tumours.",

For many years, different strategies have been investigated to facilitate BBB crossing of therapeutic agents [9]. A promising novel avenue is the use of nanotechnology, i.e. the use of molecular devices (nanocarriers) with a diameter ranging from 5 to 500 nm for drug delivery to the brain [10,11]. Various nanotechnology-based approaches like micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, dendrimers and solid lipid nanoparticles have been studied and tested for glioma treatment [9,unpublished]. Liposomes have extensively been tested for drug delivery and various formulations are tested in clinical trials [12]. Polymeric carriers (polymersomes) are superior over liposomes in terms of a better loading capability, longer blood circulation time, less drug leakage and larger storage capacity [9]. Further advantages include the lower drug toxicity by controlled drug release and improved drug pharmacokinetics via increased drug stability and solubility [13]. Polymeric vesicles are characterized with an aqueous core surrounded by a hydrophobic bi-layer membrane composed of amphiphilic block copolymers (Fig. 1, [14]), allowing loading of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents. Polymersomes are highly versatile and biologically stable, and drug encapsulation and release capabilities can be modulated [15]. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated MEK162 loaded polymeric nanocarriers in combination with irradiation and TMZ on human brain U87MG tumour cells growing as 3D spheroid. Blood-brain barrier passaging was studied in an in vitro transwell BBB model with human vascular endothelial cells.",

Methods In vitro studies were performed using multicellular U87 human GBM spheroids. Polymeric nanocarriers (polymersomes) were loaded with MEK162. The interaction between nanocarrier delivered MEK162, irradiation and TMZ was studied on the kinetics of spheroid growth and on protein expression in the MAPK/ERK pathway. BBB passaging was evaluated in a transwell system with human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells. Results MEK162 loaded polymersomes inhibited spheroid growth. A synergistic effect was found in combination with fractionated irradiation and an additive effect with TMZ on spheroid volume reduction. Fluorescent labeled polymersomes were taken up by human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and passed the BBB in vitro. Conclusion MEK162 loaded polymersomes are taken up by multicellular spheroids. The nanocarrier delivered drug reduced spheroid growth and inhibited its molecular target. MEK162 delivered via polymersomes showed interaction with irradiation and TMZ. The polymersomes crossed the in vitro BBB model and therewith offer exciting challenges ahead for delivery of therapeutics agents to brain tumours.\n## Introduction\nA major problem is that the delivery of most chemotherapeutic and molecular targeted agents, including MAPK inhibitors, is abrogated by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [7,8]. For many years, different strategies have been investigated to facilitate BBB crossing of therapeutic agents [9]. A promising novel avenue is the use of nanotechnology, i.e. the use of molecular devices (nanocarriers) with a diameter ranging from 5 to 500 nm for drug delivery to the brain [10,11]. Various nanotechnology-based approaches like micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, dendrimers and solid lipid nanoparticles have been studied and tested for glioma treatment [9,unpublished]. Liposomes have extensively been tested for drug delivery and various formulations are tested in clinical trials [12]. Polymeric carriers (polymersomes) are superior over liposomes in terms of a better loading capability, longer blood circulation time, less drug leakage and larger storage capacity [9]. Further advantages include the lower drug toxicity by controlled drug release and improved drug pharmacokinetics via increased drug stability and solubility [13]. Polymeric vesicles are characterized with an aqueous core surrounded by a hydrophobic bi-layer membrane composed of amphiphilic block copolymers (Fig. 1, [14]), allowing loading of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents. Polymersomes are highly versatile and biologically stable, and drug encapsulation and release capabilities can be modulated [15]. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated MEK162 loaded polymeric nanocarriers in combination with irradiation and TMZ on human brain U87MG tumour cells growing as 3D spheroid. Blood-brain barrier passaging was studied in an in vitro transwell BBB model with human vascular endothelial cells.",

The TAT-MPLs were designed to target the brain by magnetic guidance and TAT conjugation. The drugs hesperidin (HES), naringin (NAR), and glutathione (GSH) were encapsulated in MPLs with drug loading capacity (>10%) and drug encapsulation efficiency (>90%). The therapeutic efficacy of the drug-loaded TAT-MPLs in bEnd.3 cells was compared with that of drug-loaded MPLs. The cells accumulated higher levels of TAT-MPLs than MPLs. In addition, the accumulation of QD-loaded fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled TAT-MPLs in bEnd.3 cells was dose and time dependent. Our results show that TAT-conjugated MPLs may function as an effective drug delivery system that crosses the blood brain barrier to the brain.",

Many potential drugs have been abandoned during their development for their poor ability to cross the BBB in sufficient quantities to produce a therapeutic effect [1]. The BBB is not only an anatomical barrier to the free movement of solutes between the blood and brain, but also a transport and metabolic barrier [2]. Consequently, developing tools and methods that allow the therapeutic agents to delivery to the brain safely and effectively in vivo is important. \n\nNanocarrier systems, such as micelles, liposomes [3,4], and polymeric nanoparticles [5,6], have been investigated for delivering therapeutic agents to the brain [7]. Magnetically driven Nanocarrier drug delivery systems are powerful tools for delivering drugs, genes and cells to a target organ, and may be suitable for delivering drugs to the brain. These systems have many unique characteristics, including the delivery of a range of biomolecules in vivo, such as DNA and siRNA [8]; non-invasive magnetic targeting with therapeutic biomolecules by using external magnetic fields over the target organ or injury site, and trackability in vivo with various imaging systems [9][10][11]. Furthermore, carrying capacity could be improved by magnetic guidance to target the drug to the brain parenchyma. In order to increase the uptake efficiency, magnetic nanoparticles can be modified with specific ligands such as cationic albumin [12], thiamine [13], or transferrin [14], surfactant coatings [15], proteins and peptides [16][17][18]. The HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide [19], which is a cell penetrating peptide, has been widely used to increase the transport efficiency of drug-loaded NPs across the BBB to the CNS [20]. TAT has been used to form the Chitosan-PEG-TAT nanoparticles for complexing siRNA to be delivered in neuronal cells [21].",

Sun, Fang Zhang, Jian Wu, Yan-yan Fu, Yang Du, Lei Zhang, Ying Sun, Yonghai Liu, Kai Ma, Hongzhi Liu, Yuan-Jian Song\n## Abstract\nMagnetic poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)/lipid nanoparticles (MPLs) were fabricated from PLGA, L-\u03b1-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-amino (polyethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG-NH2), and magnetic nanoparticles (NPs), and then conjugated to trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide. The TAT-MPLs were designed to target the brain by magnetic guidance and TAT conjugation. The drugs hesperidin (HES), naringin (NAR), and glutathione (GSH) were encapsulated in MPLs with drug loading capacity (>10%) and drug encapsulation efficiency (>90%). The therapeutic efficacy of the drug-loaded TAT-MPLs in bEnd.3 cells was compared with that of drug-loaded MPLs. The cells accumulated higher levels of TAT-MPLs than MPLs. In addition, the accumulation of QD-loaded fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled TAT-MPLs in bEnd.3 cells was dose and time dependent. Our results show that TAT-conjugated MPLs may function as an effective drug delivery system that crosses the blood brain barrier to the brain.\n## Introduction\nDeveloping an effective drug delivery system with the ability of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) is the crucial point in treating diseases of the human central nervous system (CNS) effectively. Many potential drugs have been abandoned during their development for their poor ability to cross the BBB in sufficient quantities to produce a therapeutic effect [1]. The BBB is not only an anatomical barrier to the free movement of solutes between the blood and brain, but also a transport and metabolic barrier [2]. Consequently, developing tools and methods that allow the therapeutic agents to delivery to the brain safely and effectively in vivo is important. \n\nNanocarrier systems, such as micelles, liposomes [3,4], and polymeric nanoparticles [5,6], have been investigated for delivering therapeutic agents to the brain [7]. Magnetically driven Nanocarrier drug delivery systems are powerful tools for delivering drugs, genes and cells to a target organ, and may be suitable for delivering drugs to the brain. These systems have many unique characteristics, including the delivery of a range of biomolecules in vivo, such as DNA and siRNA [8]; non-invasive magnetic targeting with therapeutic biomolecules by using external magnetic fields over the target organ or injury site, and trackability in vivo with various imaging systems [9][10][11]. Furthermore, carrying capacity could be improved by magnetic guidance to target the drug to the brain parenchyma. In order to increase the uptake efficiency, magnetic nanoparticles can be modified with specific ligands such as cationic albumin [12], thiamine [13], or transferrin [14], surfactant coatings [15], proteins and peptides [16][17][18]. The HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide [19], which is a cell penetrating peptide, has been widely used to increase the transport efficiency of drug-loaded NPs across the BBB to the CNS [20]. TAT has been used to form the Chitosan-PEG-TAT nanoparticles for complexing siRNA to be delivered in neuronal cells [21].",

            "abstract": "Significance Drug delivery via nanocarriers is a groundbreaking approach. However, the in vivo behaviors of these nanocarriers remain largely unknown due to the lack of techniques. Here, we develop an optical method to image nanocarriers in tissues. Our method offers unique advantages including single-particle sensitivity, chemical specificity, and particle counting capability. With this method, we observe individual nanocarriers that cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and count their absolute number in the brain. We find that the fate of nanocarriers varies substantially across multiple scales and the transport of nanocarriers to the brain decreases with age. This technology has the potential to greatly advance the development and translation of nanocarrier-based treatment.",

However, the in vivo behaviors of these nanocarriers remain largely unknown due to the lack of techniques. Here, we develop an optical method to image nanocarriers in tissues. Our method offers unique advantages including single-particle sensitivity, chemical specificity, and particle counting capability. With this method, we observe individual nanocarriers that cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and count their absolute number in the brain. We find that the fate of nanocarriers varies substantially across multiple scales and the transport of nanocarriers to the brain decreases with age. This technology has the potential to greatly advance the development and translation of nanocarrier-based treatment.\n## nanomedicine | single particle imaging | blood-brain barrier | stimulated Raman microscopy\nCentral nervous system (CNS) diseases such as clinical depression, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors are among the most destructive and poorly treated diseases (1)(2)(3).Drug development for CNS diseases suffers from long development time and low success rate (3).One major challenge is to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (4)(5)(6)(7)(8).In fact, more than 98% of small-molecule drugs and ~100% of macromolecule drugs failed to cross the BBB (5).To this end, nanomedicine has emerged as a promising method (9)(10)(11).Encapsulation of drugs into functionalized nanocarriers can improve drug bioavailability, realize controlled release, and reduce immune response (12,13).The first nanocarriers that achieved successful drug delivery across the BBB were poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanoparticles through intravenous (IV) injection to mice in 1995 (14).Various aspects of this process have been documented (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22), making PBCA the best-studied model system.After this pioneering study, various nanocarrier systems, including polymer nanoparticles (10,(23)(24)(25)(26)(27), liposomes (28)(29)(30)(31)(32), and albumin-or chitosan-based nanoparticles (33)(34)(35)(36)(37), have been explored.\n\nDespite its rapid progress, nanomedicine has yet to deliver on its promise for treating CNS diseases.Clinically, development of brain-targeted nanomedicine seems to have reached an impasse: there is still no FDA-approved CNS nanomedicine up to now (11).Scientifically, the understanding of nanomedicine for CNS diseases remains primitive.",

Teleanu\n## Abstract\nThe field of neuronanomedicine has recently emerged as the bridge between neurological sciences and nanotechnology. The possibilities of this novel perspective are promising for the diagnosis and treatment strategies of severe central nervous system disorders. Therefore, the development of nano-vehicles capable of permeating the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and reaching the brain parenchyma may lead to breakthrough therapies that could improve life expectancy and quality of the patients diagnosed with brain disorders. The aim of this review is to summarize the recently developed organic, inorganic, and biological nanocarriers that could be used for the delivery of imaging and therapeutic agents to the brain, as well as the latest studies on the use of nanomaterials in brain cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and stroke. Additionally, the main challenges and limitations associated with the use of these nanocarriers are briefly presented.\n## Nanocarriers for Brain Targeting\nDelivering drugs to the brain represents a challenge because conventional neuropharmaceuticals do not possess the appropriate physicochemical characteristics regarding molecular size, lipid solubility, and surface charge [24]. Hence, owing to the capacity to modulate their interactions with endothelial Pharmaceutics 2019, 11, 101 3 of 23 cells in the brain through surface functionalization, various nanocarriers have been employed [25]. Therefore, the encapsulation of therapeutic and imaging agents into specific nanocarriers might overcome the challenges associated with the conventional delivery methods across the BBB [26]. Additionally, after intravenous administration, nanocarriers are capable of crossing the tissues in the organism and reach the central nervous system [27]. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages associated with each nanocarrier type, as well as the surface functionalization strategies is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the specific pathways to cross the BBB for each nanocarrier is presented in Figure 2.

The pharmacokinetics of the encapsulated agents is mainly influenced by the structure of the polymer and the entrapping method [31]. \n\nThe mechanisms for brain uptake and drug release of polymeric nanoparticles have been intensively studied in order to design nanocarriers that can efficiently deliver therapeutics to the central nervous system through systemic and local administration.",

            "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most frequent case of neurodegenerative disease and is becoming a major public health problem all over the world. Many therapeutic strategies have been explored for several decades; however, there is still no curative treatment, and the priority remains prevention. In this review, we present an update on the clinical and physiological phase of the AD spectrum, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for AD treatment with a focus on prevention strategies, then research models used in AD, followed by a discussion of treatment limitations. The prevention methods can significantly slow AD evolution and are currently the best strategy possible before the advanced stages of the disease. Indeed, current drug treatments have only symptomatic effects, and disease-modifying treatments are not yet available. Drug delivery to the central nervous system remains a complex process and represents a challenge for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Studies are underway to test new techniques to facilitate the bioavailability of molecules to the brain. After a deep study of the literature, we find the use of soft nanoparticles, in particular nanoliposomes and exosomes, as an innovative approach for preventive and therapeutic strategies in reducing the risk of AD and solving problems of brain bioavailability. Studies show the promising role of nanoliposomes and exosomes as smart drug delivery systems able to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier and target brain tissues. Finally, the different drug administration techniques for neurological disorders are discussed. One of the promising therapeutic methods is the intranasal administration strategy which should be used for preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "text": "Another challenge in AD treatments is the efficient delivery and targeting of molecules of interest to the brain due to the protective barriers of the central nervous system [27,28]. With the brain as the target tissue, one obstacle that needs to be overcome is the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). BBB protects the CNS from potential neurotoxins, toxic organisms, and chemical substances in the blood, but that also limits its accessibility for many therapeutic drug molecules [27]. \n\nThe use of nanoparticles (NP), with sizes between 10 and 1000 nm, capable of encapsulating therapeutic molecules by targeting transport processes in the CNS, can improve the crossing of molecules through the BBB in neurological disorders and reach targeted brain regions [29][30][31]. Soft NP, such as nanoliposomes (NL) or exosomes, represent one of the most effective drug delivery processes to be able to protect therapeutic agents and deliver them to the target tissues [32,33]. A growing number of studies report a restorative effect of NL on cellular and animal models of neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, AD) [34][35][36], suggesting improved NP-mediated bioavailability in the CNS. \n\nFurthermore, nanotechnology can be used to improve the bioavailability of PUFA in the form of NL [34,37]. NLs are spherical and closed vesicles with diameters in the nanometer range, formed by phospholipid bilayers dispersed in an aqueous medium [38,39]. NL can be designed to contain n-3 PUFA-rich phospholipids with beneficial neuroprotective properties. Moreover, NL can be used to encapsulate a variety of molecules, including hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs, proteins, or DNA [40]. They represent an excellent drug delivery process because of their biofilm characteristics which closely resemble those of cell membranes. In addition, NL forms a protective barrier that protects the molecules from degradation by enzymes in the mouth and stomach, digestive juices, bile acid, and intestinal microorganisms [41,42].",

Elkhoury, Margreet Morsink, K. Broersen, M. Linder, A. Tamayol, C. Malaplate, F. Yen, E. Arab-Tehrany\n## Abstract\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most frequent case of neurodegenerative disease and is becoming a major public health problem all over the world. Many therapeutic strategies have been explored for several decades; however, there is still no curative treatment, and the priority remains prevention. In this review, we present an update on the clinical and physiological phase of the AD spectrum, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for AD treatment with a focus on prevention strategies, then research models used in AD, followed by a discussion of treatment limitations. The prevention methods can significantly slow AD evolution and are currently the best strategy possible before the advanced stages of the disease. Indeed, current drug treatments have only symptomatic effects, and disease-modifying treatments are not yet available. Drug delivery to the central nervous system remains a complex process and represents a challenge for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Studies are underway to test new techniques to facilitate the bioavailability of molecules to the brain. After a deep study of the literature, we find the use of soft nanoparticles, in particular nanoliposomes and exosomes, as an innovative approach for preventive and therapeutic strategies in reducing the risk of AD and solving problems of brain bioavailability. Studies show the promising role of nanoliposomes and exosomes as smart drug delivery systems able to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier and target brain tissues. Finally, the different drug administration techniques for neurological disorders are discussed. One of the promising therapeutic methods is the intranasal administration strategy which should be used for preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases.\n## Introduction\nAnother challenge in AD treatments is the efficient delivery and targeting of molecules of interest to the brain due to the protective barriers of the central nervous system [27,28]. With the brain as the target tissue, one obstacle that needs to be overcome is the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). BBB protects the CNS from potential neurotoxins, toxic organisms, and chemical substances in the blood, but that also limits its accessibility for many therapeutic drug molecules [27]. \n\nThe use of nanoparticles (NP), with sizes between 10 and 1000 nm, capable of encapsulating therapeutic molecules by targeting transport processes in the CNS, can improve the crossing of molecules through the BBB in neurological disorders and reach targeted brain regions [29][30][31]. Soft NP, such as nanoliposomes (NL) or exosomes, represent one of the most effective drug delivery processes to be able to protect therapeutic agents and deliver them to the target tissues [32,33]. A growing number of studies report a restorative effect of NL on cellular and animal models of neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, AD) [34][35][36], suggesting improved NP-mediated bioavailability in the CNS. \n\nFurthermore, nanotechnology can be used to improve the bioavailability of PUFA in the form of NL [34,37]. NLs are spherical and closed vesicles with diameters in the nanometer range, formed by phospholipid bilayers dispersed in an aqueous medium [38,39]. NL can be designed to contain n-3 PUFA-rich phospholipids with beneficial neuroprotective properties. Moreover, NL can be used to encapsulate a variety of molecules, including hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs, proteins, or DNA [40]. They represent an excellent drug delivery process because of their biofilm characteristics which closely resemble those of cell membranes. In addition, NL forms a protective barrier that protects the molecules from degradation by enzymes in the mouth and stomach, digestive juices, bile acid, and intestinal microorganisms [41,42].",

The BBB also protects brain tissues and neural cells from pathogenic toxins and is selective for the transport of large size drug molecules via lacking fenestrations for drug uptake. 7,8 It is evident from previous prestigious research that nanocarriers (NCs) targeting is the exceptional approach to treating brain diseases by overcoming the barriers, ie, the BBB. Drug delivery systems (DDS) based on nanocarriers has revolutionized therapeutic applications by improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic patterns of various drugs, allowing them to cross the BBB without disrupting its functionalization. 9 Furthermore, DDS based on nanocarriers have some promising physicochemical and biological characteristics, including long blood circulation time, capacity to cross different barriers, cellular uptake, small size and large surface area, advanced pharmacokinetic features, ability to attach different molecules to their surface, and particular structural characteristics. Additionally, the utilization of nanocarriers led to the development of a highly effective regimen by increasing the therapeutic index and drug concentrations at the target site. 10,11 Furthermore, the latest advances in nanotechnology have anticipated the development of novel nanotherapeutics. For example, by binding to an appropriate ligand, NCs can sustain and target drug cargo directly into the brain, thereby reducing peripheral toxicity. Furthermore, researchers have highlighted some exciting approaches to NCs to increase the drug residence time (DRT) by coupling them with preactivated and thiolated polymers to constrain the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) outflow efficiently. In this regard, various types of nanocarriers, including polymeric micelles, polymeric nanocarriers, dendrimers, liposomal systems (active-targeting, cationic, stimulisensitive conventional and long-circulating), gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots (QDs), were utilized for brain targeting via coupling with identified receptors to cross the BBB proficiently.

Various drug delivery systems are focused on drug-targeting of brain cells. However, the manifestation of the brain barrier is the main hurdle for the effective delivery of chemotherapeutics, ultimately causing treatment failure of various drugs. To solve this problem, various nanocarrier-based drug delivery system has been developed for brain targeting. This review outlines nanocarrier-based composites for different brain diseases and highlights nanocarriers for drug targeting towards brain cells. It also summarizes the latest developments in nanocarrier-based delivery systems containing liposomal systems, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, polymeric nanocarriers, quantum dots (QDs), and gold nanoparticles. Besides, the optimal properties of nanocarriers and therapeutic implications for brain targeting have been extensively studied. Finally, the potential applications and research opportunities for nanocarriers in brain targeting are discussed.\n## Introduction\nB. 5,6 BCECs are classically considered a significant opportunity for brain drug targeting due to a wide-ranging network of receptors and transporters that enable the transport of essential components, including small solutes and large hydrophilic compounds (insulin, transferrin, etc.). The BBB also protects brain tissues and neural cells from pathogenic toxins and is selective for the transport of large size drug molecules via lacking fenestrations for drug uptake. 7,8 It is evident from previous prestigious research that nanocarriers (NCs) targeting is the exceptional approach to treating brain diseases by overcoming the barriers, ie, the BBB. Drug delivery systems (DDS) based on nanocarriers has revolutionized therapeutic applications by improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic patterns of various drugs, allowing them to cross the BBB without disrupting its functionalization. 9 Furthermore, DDS based on nanocarriers have some promising physicochemical and biological characteristics, including long blood circulation time, capacity to cross different barriers, cellular uptake, small size and large surface area, advanced pharmacokinetic features, ability to attach different molecules to their surface, and particular structural characteristics. Additionally, the utilization of nanocarriers led to the development of a highly effective regimen by increasing the therapeutic index and drug concentrations at the target site. 10,11 Furthermore, the latest advances in nanotechnology have anticipated the development of novel nanotherapeutics. For example, by binding to an appropriate ligand, NCs can sustain and target drug cargo directly into the brain, thereby reducing peripheral toxicity. Furthermore, researchers have highlighted some exciting approaches to NCs to increase the drug residence time (DRT) by coupling them with preactivated and thiolated polymers to constrain the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) outflow efficiently. In this regard, various types of nanocarriers, including polymeric micelles, polymeric nanocarriers, dendrimers, liposomal systems (active-targeting, cationic, stimulisensitive conventional and long-circulating), gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots (QDs), were utilized for brain targeting via coupling with identified receptors to cross the BBB proficiently.

Zhou\n## Abstract\nPolyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats encoding proteins with abnormally expanded polyglutamine tract. A total of nine polyQ disorders have been identified, including Huntington\u2019s disease, six spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). The diseases of this class are each considered rare, yet polyQ diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. While each subtype of polyQ diseases has its own causative gene, certain pathologic molecular attributes have been implicated in virtually all of the polyQ diseases, including protein aggregation, proteolytic cleavage, neuronal dysfunction, transcription dysregulation, autophagy impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although animal models of polyQ disease are available helping to understand their pathogenesis and access disease-modifying therapies, there is neither a cure nor prevention for these diseases, with only symptomatic treatments available. In this paper, we analyze data from the CAS Content Collection to summarize the research progress in the class of polyQ diseases. We examine the publication landscape in the area in effort to provide insights into current knowledge advances and developments. We review the most discussed concepts and assess the strategies to combat these diseases. Finally, we inspect clinical applications of products against polyQ diseases with their development pipelines. The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge regarding the class of polyQ diseases, to outline challenges, and evaluate growth opportunities to further efforts in combating the diseases.\n## \u25a0 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES\nDrug Delivery Systems.

Such nanoscopic drug carriers have more excellent abilities over conventional nanomaterials for permeating to brain parenchyma in vitro and in vivo. Nanogel-based system can be nanoengineered to bypass physiological barriers via non-invasive treatment, rendering it a most suitable platform for the management of neurological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumors, epilepsy and ischemic stroke, etc. Therapeutics of central nervous system (CNS) diseases have shown marked limited site-specific delivery of CNS by the poor access of various drugs into the brain, due to the presences of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Hence, the availability of therapeutics delivery strategies is considered as one of the most major challenges facing the treatment of CNS diseases. The primary objective of this review is to elaborate the newer advances of nanogel for CNS drugs delivery, discuss the early preclinical success in the field of nanogel technology and highlight different insights on its potential neurotoxicity.",

Such nanoscopic drug carriers have more excellent abilities over conventional nanomaterials for permeating to brain parenchyma in vitro and in vivo. Nanogel-based system can be nanoengineered to bypass physiological barriers via non-invasive treatment, rendering it a most suitable platform for the management of neurological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumors, epilepsy and ischemic stroke, etc. Therapeutics of central nervous system (CNS) diseases have shown marked limited site-specific delivery of CNS by the poor access of various drugs into the brain, due to the presences of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Hence, the availability of therapeutics delivery strategies is considered as one of the most major challenges facing the treatment of CNS diseases. The primary objective of this review is to elaborate the newer advances of nanogel for CNS drugs delivery, discuss the early preclinical success in the field of nanogel technology and highlight different insights on its potential neurotoxicity.\n## Strategies Across the Brain Barriers\nA variety of strategies have been developed to overcome the challenge of transporting the drugs across the BBB; however, the discoveries of most of strategies have not resulted in significant advances.Table 2 describes the strategies to improve the BBB penetration of active drugs/agents.New advances in nanotechnology have produced various opportunities in the field of CNS disorders because nanocarrier systems have been shown to load poorly distributed drugs in the brain, traverse the cellular/metabolic barrier regions of the BBB, and efficiently deliver the drugs into the brain parenchyma (Poovaiah et al., 2018;Prasanna and Upadhyay, 2021;Wang et al., 2021).For example, Harbi et al. designed sertraline (Ser-HCl)-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes.The results of analysis of the transport in endothelial polyoma cells of the mouse brain showed that glycosylated liposomes have a greater ability to target the cerebellum than PEGylated liposomes (Harbi et al., 2016).\n\nThe transport of drug nanocarrier systems across the BBB mainly involves the following mechanisms: 1) receptormediated endocytosis; 2) adsorptive-mediated endocytosis; 3) carrier-mediated transport; 4) passive diffusion; 5) efflux pump inhibition; and 6) the transient opening of the TJs of BBB.Surface functionalization of nanocarriers is a potential strategy to facilitate crossing of the BBB, enabling their entry into the brain via a transcellular pathway due to their specific targeting.Thus, the development of optimal drug delivery systems for CNS diseases should consider not only the ability to cross the BBB but also the ability to target and accumulate the drugs.Nanoscale particles can traverse the smallest capillaries, previous studies have demonstrated that after intravenous administration, the particles in the range of 5-10 nm are rapidly removed by the kidney, whereas the particles ranging from 10 to 50 nm are small enough to traverse the capillaries.",

Surmounting this barrier is crucial for delivering drugs effectively and targeting precise areas of the brain affected by conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors.

                    "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a formidable opposition to effectively treating many brain diseases because it limits the passage of cells and molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. Successfully overcoming this barrier is essential for delivering pharmacologically active molecules to targeted sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Multiple strategies have been suggested to enhance drug delivery through BBB. These include locally bypassing the barrier with direct injections or nasal applications of drugs and enhancing overall delivery through the bloodstream [1]. \n\nAn emerging frontier in pharmaceutical research entails the development of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, which hold particular significance in addressing CNS disorders while surmounting the formidable BBB. This barrier, primarily constituted of brain microvascular endothelial cells endowed with tight junctions (TJs), poses formidable difficulties to the passage of therapeutic compounds from the systemic circulation into the brain parenchyma [1]. To confront this challenge, innovative strategies such as nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems have been devised, offering the capability to encapsulate drugs and augment their transport across the BBB. Moreover, molecular targeting methodologies employing ligands specifically tailored to receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells present a promising avenue for facilitating enhanced drug penetration into the CNS [1]. These advancements are significant for elevating the therapeutic efficacy and mitigating off-target effects in treating neurological conditions, encompassing neurodegenerative diseases and brain malignancies. Nevertheless, continued research and development endeavors are imperative to refine the design and performance of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, thereby ensuring their safety, efficacy, and translational viability. \n\nA tightly regulated microenvironment is vital for the normal operations of the CNS. A biological membrane at the blood-brain interface effectively separates the brain and the rest of the body. Paul Ehrlich initially discovered this barrier when he observed that a dye injected peripherally failed to stain brain tissue [2]. Subsequent experiments by Ehrlich's colleague, Goldmann, using the same dye in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), further validated this finding by demonstrating selective staining of brain tissue without leakage into the surrounding areas [2].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a vital checkpoint in neuropharmacology, safeguarding the central nervous system (CNS) from potentially harmful substances while also presenting a formidable barrier to therapeutic agents [1,2].The CNS is effectively safeguarded by physiological barriers, specifically the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.The BBB's selective permeability is governed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which exhibit a phenotype that is finely tuned to the CNS environment.BBB is impermeable to many molecules, with less than 2% of most drugs reaching the CNS, by creating continuous tight junctions and overexpressing several types of molecular efflux pumps [3][4][5].This results in a barrier that is virtually impenetrable to most molecules, including a vast majority of pharmaceutical compounds [6].\n\nIt is well known that nanotechnology has led to the emergence of various types of nanomaterials that are being considered as promising carriers due to their unique advantages.Many approaches including functionalized nanocarriers were widely used to transport drugs or other molecules (such as nucleic acids, proteins, or imaging agents) across the BBB [7].\n\nThe types of nanoparticles (NPs) were categorized as inorganicbased nanocarriers, polymer-based, and biomimetic-based [8].The further application of brain drug delivery is still limited by the large size of NPs, poor targeting efficacy, and difficulties in production [9,10].Hence, the design of a noninvasive approach for the delivery of macromolecules or therapeutics to the brain has been still at the forefront of research [11,12].\n\nIn the past few decades, numerous therapeutic delivery strategies have been demonstrated to effectively transport drug molecules across the BBB [13].Among these strategies, modification of drug molecules has exhibited promising potential [14].Recently, among the available CNS drugs, small molecules constitute the majority of successful CNS therapeutics owing to their capacity to traverse the BBB via passive or carrier-mediated mechanisms [15].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains homeostasis in the brain by selective transport of metabolic compounds, while excluding harmful compounds from the blood circulation. These barrier properties prevent adequate BBB crossing of many high potential ''would-be'' central nervous system (CNS) drugs. Most hydrophilic molecules are not able to cross the BBB due to the presence of tight junctions between the brain endothelial cells preventing paracellular transport. Transport of other more lipophilic small molecules that could potentially cross the barrier is often limited because they are substrate for efflux transporters like the p-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug related protein (MRP) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters [1][2][3]. Many strategies to enhance the BBB transport of drugs have therefore been investigated. These strategies are either focused on locally circumventing the BBB by direct injections in the brain or through the blood stream for widespread delivery [4][5][6][7].\n\nFor the blood-to-brain delivery of drugs via the blood stream, advanced drug delivery systems like nanocarriers can best be used. Some examples of commonly used nanocarriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, albumin nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles [8]. Drug delivery using nanocarriers may increase the bioavailability and stability of drugs and decrease the (peripheral) toxicity. Furthermore, drugs delivered by liposomes are described to be able to bypass the efflux transporters at the BBB [9,10]. Moreover, liposomal formulation allows a wide range of compounds, like small molecules, peptides, proteins and RNA to be encapsulated without changing their function and protecting them against degradation and potential immune responses. Coating of liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) further ensures a prolonged circulation time in plasma allowing prolonged dosing intervals. As a result, liposomes have been used in clinical practice for several years and are shown to be effective and safe for human use (e.g. Doxil \u00d5 , Ambisome \u00d5 ). Liposomes can furthermore be functionalized with ligands to target specific cell types",

            "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of the neurological ailments which continue to represent a major public health challenge, owing to increased life expectancy and aging population. Progressive memory loss and decrease in cognitive behavior, owing to irreversible destruction of neurons along with expensive therapeutic interventions, call for an effective, alternate, yet affordable treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Safe and effective delivery of neurotherapeutics in Alzheimer\u2019s like central nervous system (CNS) disorders still remains elusive despite the major advances in both neuroscience and drug delivery research. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) with its tight endothelial cell layer surrounded by astrocyte foot processes poses as a major barrier for the entry of drugs into the brain. Nasal drug delivery has emerged as a reliable method to bypass this blood\u2013brain barrier and deliver a wide range of neurotherapeutic agents to the brain effectively. This nasal route comprises the olfactory or trigeminal nerves originating from the brain and terminating into the nasal cavity at the respiratory epithelium or olfactory neuroepithelium. They represent the most direct method of noninvasive entry into the brain, opening the most suitable therapeutic avenue for treatment of neurological diseases. Also, drugs loaded into nanocarriers can have better interaction with the mucosa that assists in the direct brain delivery of active molecules bypassing the BBB and achieving rapid cerebrospinal fluid levels. Lipid particulate systems, emulsion-based systems, vesicular drug delivery systems, and other nanocarriers have evolved as promising drug delivery approaches for the effective brain delivery of anti-Alzheimer\u2019s drugs with improved permeability and bioavailability via the nasal route. Charge, size, nature of neurotherapeutics, and formulation excipients influence the effective and targeted drug delivery using nanocarriers via the nasal route. This article elaborates on the recent advances in nanocarrier-based nasal drug delivery systems for the direct and effective brain delivery of the neurotherapeutic molecules. Additionally, we have attempted to highlight various experimental strategies, underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis and therapy of central nervous system diseases, computational approaches, and clinical investigations pursued so far to attain and enhance the direct delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain via the nose",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a formidable challenge to drug delivery in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The BBB consists primarily of brain endothelial cells, forming a tight monolayer connected by intricate junctional complexes. Its precise functioning hinges on ongoing interactions with additional cellular constituents, including pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, or microglia, forming altogether the neurovascular unit (NVU) [1]. This cellular arrangement, along with the presence of efflux transporters and the lack of fenestrations, restricts the transport of molecules. While this barrier serves a crucial protective role for maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS microenvironment, it also poses a significant obstacle to brain drug delivery. Hence, effectively delivering drugs across the BBB represents a pivotal challenge in developing treatments for CNS disorders. Some of the most troublesome CNS diseases that could benefit from enhanced brain drug delivery include brain tumours, neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury or stroke. \n\nThe clinical demand for strategies facilitating brain delivery has prompted the exploration of diverse approaches to ensure safe and efficient targeted brain drug delivery. While the most advanced projects have progressed to clinical trials, none has resulted in the launch of new drugs thus far [2]. \n\nIn this context, nanomedicine emerges as a delivery platform with the potential to elevate the levels of therapeutic agents in the brain by improving the distribution of drugs across the cerebral endothelium [3]. The development of nanocarriers capable of effectively crossing the BBB can be achieved through passive, active, or physical targeting [4]. Passive targeting relies on exploiting the paracellular transport through fenestrations of damaged BBB, while active targeting involves the use of ligands that specifically bind to receptors overexpressed on the brain endothelium to drive BBB crossing. However, designing targeted delivery systems based on either of these inherent biophysical characteristics of the BBB can pose challenges given the heterogeneous idiosyncrasy of the brain vasculature. Alternatively, physical targeting utilizes external stimuli to enhance the delivery of nanoparticles to the brain.",

These nanocarriers can have an organic or inorganic core and a surface coating with organic moieties able to interact with the biological system at a molecular level for crossing the BBB. 31 Modification of nanocarrier surface by adsorption or covalent linking of hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG, polysorbate 80, or polysaccharides, leads to an increase in nanocarrier circulation in the blood, whereas the surface derivatization with molecules that recognize cellular receptors facilitates the penetration of nanoparticles through the BBB. 32 he strategy often termed active targeting involves two types of transports: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) and receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). The AMT has gained considerable attention because several studies assess that this strategy has the possibility to enhance the transport of nanocarriers across the BBB, using cationic proteins or cell-penetrating peptides. 33 However, as AMT is a nonspecific process, conjugation of such cationic proteins will also increase the adsorptive uptake process of nanocarriers in other parts of the body, which may possibly create toxic and immunogenic concerns.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a formidable opposition to effectively treating many brain diseases because it limits the passage of cells and molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. Successfully overcoming this barrier is essential for delivering pharmacologically active molecules to targeted sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Multiple strategies have been suggested to enhance drug delivery through BBB. These include locally bypassing the barrier with direct injections or nasal applications of drugs and enhancing overall delivery through the bloodstream [1]. \n\nAn emerging frontier in pharmaceutical research entails the development of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, which hold particular significance in addressing CNS disorders while surmounting the formidable BBB. This barrier, primarily constituted of brain microvascular endothelial cells endowed with tight junctions (TJs), poses formidable difficulties to the passage of therapeutic compounds from the systemic circulation into the brain parenchyma [1]. To confront this challenge, innovative strategies such as nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems have been devised, offering the capability to encapsulate drugs and augment their transport across the BBB. Moreover, molecular targeting methodologies employing ligands specifically tailored to receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells present a promising avenue for facilitating enhanced drug penetration into the CNS [1]. These advancements are significant for elevating the therapeutic efficacy and mitigating off-target effects in treating neurological conditions, encompassing neurodegenerative diseases and brain malignancies. Nevertheless, continued research and development endeavors are imperative to refine the design and performance of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, thereby ensuring their safety, efficacy, and translational viability. \n\nA tightly regulated microenvironment is vital for the normal operations of the CNS. A biological membrane at the blood-brain interface effectively separates the brain and the rest of the body. Paul Ehrlich initially discovered this barrier when he observed that a dye injected peripherally failed to stain brain tissue [2]. Subsequent experiments by Ehrlich's colleague, Goldmann, using the same dye in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), further validated this finding by demonstrating selective staining of brain tissue without leakage into the surrounding areas [2].",

            "text": "Surface modified fluorescent silica nanoparticle derivatives have shown potential for applying them as nano-vehicles for drug delivery to the brain considering the possibility of attaching various types of molecules to the core [86]. By attaching lactoferrin on the surface of the polyethylene glycol-coated silica nanoparticles, the process of receptor-mediated transcytosis of these nanosystems has been enhanced, with a maximum transport efficiency observed for nanoparticles with 25 nm in diameter. Thus, these nanosystems could be employed for drugs and imaging probes delivery across the blood-brain barrier [87]. The application of silica nanoparticles to deliver nootropics, such as piracetam, pentoxifylline, and pyridoxine, that are designed to enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier has been reported. The efficiency of silica nanoparticles as nanocarriers for drugs in comparison to the unencapsulated drugs has been demonstrated, since the latter were not detected in the brains of the mice [58]. \n\nA comparative study between spherical and rod-shaped bare mesoporous silica nanoparticles and poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ethylene imine)-coated mesoporous nanoparticles has been conducted. Although the effect of the shape on the blood-brain barrier permeability, coating the nanoparticles greatly enhanced the cellular uptake for the in vitro models. However, the in vivo imaging experiments on mice showed no blood-brain barrier penetration, which could be associated to the large dimensions of the particles, ranging from 50 to 240 nm [88]. Another study on zebrafish embryos demonstrated that blood-brain barrier penetration is dependent on the surface charge and the size of the nanoparticles, with enhanced transport capacity related to negative charges and reduced sizes [Chen C-T, Chen Y-P, Wu S-H, Chang T-Y, Chou C-M. Negatively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles penetrate through the Zebrafish larval blood-brain barrier. EuroSciCon Conference on Nanotech and Nanobiotechnology Nano; Paris.

            "text": "Limited drug delivery to the brain is one of the major reasons for high failure rates of central nervous system (CNS) drug candidates. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) with its tight junctions, membrane transporters, receptors and metabolizing enzymes is a main player in drug delivery to the brain, restricting the entrance of the drugs and other xenobiotics. Current knowledge about the uptake transporters expressed at the BBB and brain parenchymal cells has been used for delivery of CNS drugs to the brain via targeting transporters. Although many transporter-utilizing (pro)drugs and nanocarriers have been developed to improve the uptake of drugs to the brain, their success rate of translation from preclinical development to humans is negligible. In the present review, we provide a systematic summary of the current progress in development of transporter-utilizing (pro)drugs and nanocarriers for delivery of drugs to the brain. In addition, we applied CNS pharmacokinetic concepts for evaluation of the limitations and gaps in investigation of the developed transporter-utilizing (pro)drugs and nanocarriers. Finally, we give recommendations for a rational development of transporter-utilizing drug delivery systems targeting the brain based on CNS pharmacokinetic principles.",

Polymeric nanocarriers are also able to protect drugs that normally would be subject to degradation by blood proteins or by enzymes of the BBB (Kabanov & Batrakova, 2017). These enhancements of drug pharmacokinetics upon encapsulation in polymer NPs are usually attributed to the masking effect of the polymeric matrix, which shields the physicochemical properties of the drug. As a result, drug stability and pharmacokinetics will be predominantly determined by the characteristics of the NP delivery system itself (Chigumira et al., 2015). \n\nFor pharmaceutical applications, both natural and synthetic polymers can be utilized (Lockman et al., 2002).

            "text": "Under the most pathological circumstances of diseases such as strokes, seizures, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, diabetes, glioma, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted [103]. An important reason for the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is the remodeling of the protein complex in intra-endothelial junctions under the pathological conditions [104]. Normally, the blood-brain barrier acts to maintain blood-brain homeostasis by preventing entry of macromolecules and micromolecules from the blood [105]. If a drug crosses the BBB, it restricts accumulation of the drug in the intracerebral region of brain, and bioavailability is reduced, due to which brain diseases cannot be treated [106]. Therefore, the optimal drug delivery system (DDS) is a cell membrane DDS, virus-based DDS, or exosome-based DDS designed for BBB penetrability, lesion-targeting ability, and standard safety [107]. For the cure of brain diseases, the nanocarrier-assisted intranasal drug carriage system is widely used [108]. Now, at the advanced level, drugs poorly distributed to the brain can be loaded into a nanocarrier-based system, which would interact well with the endothelial micro vessel cells at the BBB and nasal mucosa to increase drug absorption time and the olfactory nerve fibers to stimulate straight nose-to-brain delivery [109], thus greater drug absorption in brain parenchyma through the secondary nose-to-blood-to-brain pathway [110]. The current strategies used are viral vectors, nanoparticles, exosomes, brain permeability enhancers, delivery through active transporters in the BBB, alteration of administration route, nanoparticles for the brain, and imaging/diagnostics under diseased conditions [111].",

            "text": "The nanomedicine drug delivery strategies aim at the improvement of drug therapeutic efficacy. Some of them affect the drug stability and by this, its kinetics, some its specificity. In more than 70% of high-grade gliomas, the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted allowing passive targeting by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, since high-grade gliomas rapidly infiltrate the surrounding brain tissue, the drug carriers still need to deal with efficient and tumor-selective drug delivery across the intact BBB. This barrier acts as a neuroprotective shield that protects the brain by restricting the free passage of molecules from the blood into the central nervous system (CNS) and hence it regulates homeostasis. [1] While intrathecalbased drug delivery is considered inefficient, the transvascular route of drug administration, following systemic injection, could virtually treat all neurons in the brain, considering that almost every neuron in the human brain has its capillary. [2] Another possible strategy is to choose nasal administration, which in combination with a suitable delivery system (e.g., poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-based nanogels) exploits retrograde axonal transport. [3] In the development of drug delivery systems, the most cited strategies to circumvent the BBB refers either to an invasive modulation of the barrier like temporal ultrasound-mediated disruption via microbubbles [4] or active transport across it. [5] Recently, May et al. presented the potential of opening BBB via sonopermeation as a safe and efficient delivery option of nanomedicine formulations to and into the brain. [6] However, the transvascular route to the brain is virtually impenetrable for the majority of therapeutic substances. [1,7] Therefore, for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson, or brain tumors, the drug or drug delivery system should: i) have the ability for efficient and selective crossing the BBB, ii) be unrecognized by efflux pumps, and iii) be protected from early degradation.

Site-specific targeting across the BBB using nanotechnology has the potential to be tailored to perform specific functions as required [142]. Nanomedicines comprise different polymeric or lipidic carriers, containing a different range of medicines. Nanomedicine possesses a size between 50 and 200 nm, which is too large to diffuse freely through the BBB [143]. To solve this problem, specific targeting moieties, such as ligands that imitate the endogenous moiety, are decorated on the surface of nanoparticles.

Both types of nanoparticles have been engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier effectively, thus providing a potential avenue for the direct administration of therapeutic agents into affected regions of the brain, therefore improving the overall PD prognosis and treatment outcome [7]. \n\nSeveral novel techniques have been proposed for target-site drug delivery in the brain using polysorbate-80 coated nanocarriers. After administration, nanocarriers aggregate in the CNS's blood capillaries. The adsorption and retention of nanocarriers on the capillary walls results in a concentration gradient. The nanocarriers diffuse through the endothelial cell layer as a result of this. Higher fluidization of the membrane is caused by the breakdown of endothelial cell layer fluids [58]. Until the discovery of drug-loaded nanocarriers administration, researchers had a difficult time inserting neurotherapeutics into the brain. Researchers are interested in this form of drug delivery because of its several advantages, including the crossing of the BBB, noninvasiveness, hepatic first-pass metabolism, ease of administration, safety, and practicality. Particle size, Zeta potential, and other surface features are some of the role-determining factors in the manufacturing of nanocarriers. For nanocarriers to establish static repulsion on surfaces and for nanocarriers and cells to interact in vivo, a minimum of 30 mV electric potential is required [63]. Nanocarriers administration through oral route must be biocompatible, cost-effective, scalable for fabrication, suited for the reticuloendothelial milieu, non-toxic, physically stable, demonstrate regulated drug release, and show little drug modification due to nanocarriers-excipient interaction. The nanocarriers must also be able to momentarily disrupt the epithelial layer of the mucosa's tight junctions, allowing the medication to pass freely or be bound with nanocarriers. The process of endocytosis or transcytosis can also be employed to transport nanocarriers across the endothelium.",

            "text": "Developing an effective drug delivery system with the ability of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) is the crucial point in treating diseases of the human central nervous system (CNS) effectively. Many potential drugs have been abandoned during their development for their poor ability to cross the BBB in sufficient quantities to produce a therapeutic effect [1]. The BBB is not only an anatomical barrier to the free movement of solutes between the blood and brain, but also a transport and metabolic barrier [2]. Consequently, developing tools and methods that allow the therapeutic agents to delivery to the brain safely and effectively in vivo is important. \n\nNanocarrier systems, such as micelles, liposomes [3,4], and polymeric nanoparticles [5,6], have been investigated for delivering therapeutic agents to the brain [7]. Magnetically driven Nanocarrier drug delivery systems are powerful tools for delivering drugs, genes and cells to a target organ, and may be suitable for delivering drugs to the brain. These systems have many unique characteristics, including the delivery of a range of biomolecules in vivo, such as DNA and siRNA [8]; non-invasive magnetic targeting with therapeutic biomolecules by using external magnetic fields over the target organ or injury site, and trackability in vivo with various imaging systems [9][10][11]. Furthermore, carrying capacity could be improved by magnetic guidance to target the drug to the brain parenchyma. In order to increase the uptake efficiency, magnetic nanoparticles can be modified with specific ligands such as cationic albumin [12], thiamine [13], or transferrin [14], surfactant coatings [15], proteins and peptides [16][17][18]. The HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide [19], which is a cell penetrating peptide, has been widely used to increase the transport efficiency of drug-loaded NPs across the BBB to the CNS [20]. TAT has been used to form the Chitosan-PEG-TAT nanoparticles for complexing siRNA to be delivered in neuronal cells [21].",

Within these general issues, recent progress in drug delivery approaches stimulated the development of novel nanocarriers encapsulating CUR, such as polymer nanoparticles (and micelles), lipid-based (and liposome) nanocarriers, liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCNs) andcyclodextrins ( Figure 6).\n\nCUR encapsulation into nanocarriers improves not only its bioavailability and solubility, but also increases its colloidal stability by protecting it from the influence of the tissue microenvironment, thus enhancing the sustained release of CUR at target sites. There are a number of key factors that govern the distribution parameters of drugs within brain tissues, including the plasma protein binding, drug-tissue interactions (and binding) in the brain region, blood (influx/efflux) flow rate at the BBB level and the rate of drug metabolism in the brain region.\n\nNowadays, newer formulations of nanocarriers are designed with the aim to achieve efficient transport and improved the therapeutic efficacy of CUR.

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) which is considered as a tight connection made up from connecting the blood capillaries comprising endothelial cell with the tight junction of pericytes, astrocytes, and basal membrane [115]. Being hardest to cross, the major barrier, i.e., BBB, provides several limitations such as insufficient delivery of the therapeutic agent. Therefore, the number of central nervous system disorder remains untreated or difficult to treat. Moreover, the restriction imposed on the infiltration of the drug molecules' brain barrier allows the entry of only a small molecule having a molecular weight (especially less than 400 Da) or for the lipid-soluble drug [116]. Thus, the scenario created the necessity to develop techniques for crossing the BBB. Several advances have been made to explore the properties of BBB for the effective treatment of brain diseases, like the delivery of drug-using nanocarrier or NPs as noninvasive techniques to enhance brain drug uptake. In the past few decades, syringe injection has been used for the delivery of drugs to the brain. But these approaches are entitled with smoke limitations like serious issues regarding the probability of infection and inflammation at the site of injection together with the occurrence of pain and anxiety, which has drawn attention toward some alternative mode of drug delivery and incompetency toward the patient [117]. Kearney et al. investigated the donepezil hydrochloride (Alzheimer's drug)-loaded MN patch. In brief, MNs are made up of PVP or poly(methyl vinyl ether co-maleic anhydride/acid) polymers. Furthermore, in vitro permeation of donepezil hydrochloride across neonatal porcine skin from the patches was investigated, with 854.71 lg \u00b1 122.71 lg donepezil hydrochloride delivered after 24 h, using patch formulation, signifying the accomplishment of this delivery proposal for donepezil hydrochloride to take care of brain disorder [118]. Another study reported that the silicon-based MNs for drug delivery in the deep brain. In this regard, MN array fabricated on silicon intended for infusion of activity in the brain to recognize connections as well as neuronal activities [119].",

            "text": "Neurotherapeutics are classes of drugs used in the treatment of brain or central nervous system disorders. The effectiveness of these actives is generally compromised due to failure reaching the site of action sufficiently. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered the most dominant physiological barrier impeding the passage of neuropharmaceuticals to the brain cells. It is a highly fortified membrane system, composed of specialized capillary endothelial cells, that protects the brain from extraneous organisms and harmful chemicals, and supplies the brain with the nutrients required (Salunkhe et al., 2015). Overcoming the difficulty in crossing BBB is the key strategy for efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain. \n\nSeveral delivery approaches were implemented aiming to target drugs to the brain via enhancing their transport across BBB. The application of nanotechnology coupled with surfactant coating is one of these propitious tactics. \n\nFor a long time, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug transport to the brain has been governed by particle coating with surfactants. The surfactant Tween V R 80 (polyethylene glycol sorbitan monooleate) is considered the gold standard effectively crossing BBB. The fact is due to the preferential adsorption of apolipoprotein E (Apo E), present in blood, on NP surfaces coated with Tween 80, rendering particles resembling the low density lipoproteins (LDL), hence interacting with LDL receptors on BBB and enhancing their cellular uptake via receptor-mediated transcytosis mechanism (Gessner et al., 2000;G\u20ac oppert & M\u20ac uller, 2003). Other surfactants were investigated for their capabilities to transport drugs across BBB, from which D-a-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Solutol V R HS 15 (polyethylene glycol-15-hydroxy stearate) (Lamprecht & Benoit, 2006;Wa Kasongo, 2010;Agrawa et al., 2017;Meng et al., 2017).",

In this method, immune cells or platelets are incorporated with drug-loaded nanocarriers which then cross BBB and navigate towards the inflammation sites within the brain by responding to chemotaxis signals and undergoing diapedesis [79]. More recently, extracellular vesicles, e.g., exosomes, have attracted significant attention as biomimetic drug carrier for CNS drug delivery.

Nanocarriers can utilize different physiological mechanisms for drug delivery across the BBB and can be modified to achieve the desired kinetics and efficacy. Consequentially, several nanocarriers have been reported to act as functional nanomedicines in preclinical studies using animal models for human diseases.

In contrast to other tissues, brain endothelial cells are more intimately associated and that prevent access of any potentially toxic substances into the brain (Pardridge, 1999). Any molecule enters through the blood into the brain is restricted by this barrier made up of endothelial cells' ''Tight Junctions\" or ''Zonula Occludens\" or also called as blood brain barrier (BBB) (Misra et al., 2003). Owing to its stringent penetrability, it is presumed to be the key obstacle in the development of central nervous system (CNS) targeted drug delivery (Pathan et al., 2009). Various strategies to use different routes of drug administration than oral or parenteral route such as intranasal and olfactory route and like to use drug nanocarriers have been applied to cope with the problem of the transportation across the blood brain barrier (Abbott and Romero, 1996).\n\nThe historical backdrop of nasal drug transportation goes once again to prior topical applications of medications proposed for local effects (Alsarra et al., 2010). Intranasal drug delivery has numerous focal compensation over other routes of drug administration (Behl et al., 1998;Costantino et al., 2007;Illum, 2000). Late improvements in nasal drug delivery have recommended intranasal administration as a safe and adequate course for brain targeting, especially for drugs with biological consequences on the CNS and constrained BBB permeability (Watts et al., 2002). The Olfactory region is of significant interest toward medication conveyance in light of the fact that it evades the BBB, conveying restorative drugs to the CNS (Frey, 2002). Nasal delivery is easily accessible, convenient, and a dependable system, with a porous endothelial membrane, and a profoundly vascularized epithelium that provides a quick assimilation of the compound into the systemic circulation, circumventing the hepatic first pass disposal (Parmar et al., 2011;Tu\u00a8rker et al., 2004). In addition to that, intranasal drug delivery enables reduction in the dose, quick therapeutic level attainment of the drug into the blood, speedier",

The characteristic features of nanogels which make them unique are their high stability in physiological solutions, high drug encapsulation efficiency, biodegradability, biocompatibility, core-shell structures, and high permeability and stimuli responsiveness. These properties make them better nanocarriers than other existing nanocarriers and can thus cross the blood-brain barrier to a greater extent. Nanogels are a promising carrier for achieving effective therapeutic doses across the BBB. Nanogels have been deployed for managing various brain diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, and neuroAIDS. The presence of tough BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) makes brain drug delivery very challenging. In this regard, nanogels can be engineered so that they can be transmigrated across BBB in a non-invasive manner (Cuggino et al. 2019). It is well known that therapeutics > 500 Da cannot cross the BBB. The therapeutic has to transmigrate across the BBB to treat brain diseases effectively. In one exciting study, fluorescently labeled poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) (p(NIPMAM)) nanogels were tested for their stiffness and their transport. It was observed that the more densely cross-linked nanogels were uptaken by brain endothelial cells. On the contrary, the less densely cross-linked nanogels showed the highest transcytosis property (Ribovski et al. 2021). Figure 3 demonstrates that nanogels with different stiffnesses tend to interact with the apical region of polarized brain endothelial cells (Ribovski et al. 2021). Another essential aspect in these years is nasal delivery of the nanogels for enhanced brain drug delivery. Hydrogen bond-enhanced nanogel for delivery of albiflorin to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) was reported. Glycyrrhizic acid was utilized as a hydrogen bond crosslinker, preventing the drug's premature release.",

These obstacles include physiological barriers, such as the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, as well as various efflux transporter proteins. In current clinical applications, ~98% of chemical drugs and 100% of protein peptide drugs cannot directly enter the brain. Because of their small size and functionalization potential, NPs can be utilized as carriers for drug delivery through the human physiological barriers. For example, the solubility of a poorly soluble drug can be improved by utilizing a drug delivery system containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. NPs have significant advantages over other currently available drug delivery systems for the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Intensive research and development is being conducted to exploit the biological effects of engineered NMs for therapeutic applications in the CNS. \n\nThe NMs used in drug-delivery systems can be divided into two types: soft NMs (lipid-or polymer-based) and hard NMs (often metals, metal oxides, or ceramics). Soft NMs have been widely applied in clinics for over a decade, and many new formulations are currently undergoing clinical trials. 14  contrast, hard NPs are not being widely implemented in clinical settings despite their substantial scientific improvements. 15 Some current NP-based strategies for brain-targeted drug delivery are listed in Table 2. The preparation of a flake-shell microcapsule is illustrated in Figure 1. \n\nNanoscaffolds for neuroregeneration: application of NPs in neural tissue engineering (neural tissue regeneration) \n\nA large proportion of the world's population suffer from traumatic injuries to the brain and spinal cord, which lead to permanent disability and thus a significant global health burden. However, only a few effective treatments are available because the CNS is refractory to axonal regeneration and relatively inaccessible to most drugs. 16 Nanoscaffolding is a medical process used for tissue regrowth, including limbs and organs. A nanoscaffold is a three-dimensional nanoscale structure composed of polymer fibers that allows damaged cell adherence and helps rebuild missing tissue. As the tissue grows, the scaffold is absorbed into the body and disappears completely. 17 Advances in nanotechnology have increased the potential for axonal regeneration after a brain injury.",

BBB is a highly complex structure that tightly regulates the movement of ions of a limited number of small molecules and of an even more restricted number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain, protecting it from injuries and diseases. However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described.

The treatment of neurological conditions, including brain tumors, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), may be greatly influenced by nanotechnology. Numerous studies on neurodegeneration have demonstrated the effective application of nanomaterials in the treatment of brain illnesses. Nanocarriers (NCs) have made it easier to deliver drugs precisely to where they are needed. Thus, the most effective use of nanomaterials is in the treatment of various brain diseases, as this amplifies the overall impact of medication and emphasizes the significance of nanotherapeutics through gene therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, and blood-barrier mechanisms. Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of multifunctional nanotherapeutic agents, a promising treatment for brain disorders. This novel method reduces the side effects and improves treatment outcomes. This review critically assesses efficient nano-based systems in light of obstacles and outstanding achievements. Nanocarriers that transfer medications across the blood-brain barrier and nano-assisted therapies, including nano-immunotherapy, nano-gene therapy, nano enzyme replacement therapy, scaffolds, and 3D to 6D printing, have been widely explored for the treatment of brain disorders. This study aimed to evaluate existing literature regarding the use of nanotechnology in the development of drug delivery systems that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic agents to treat various brain disorders.",

            "text": "Crossing the BBB remains one of the most challenging tasks for drug delivery to the brain. Different physiological pathways can be employed for crossing the BBB including receptor-mediated transcytosis or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. To reach this goal, a multitude of nanocarrier systems, such as polymeric, lipid-based or inorganic nanoparticles, have been developed and shown able to cross the BBB owing to their tailored surface properties. In numerous studies, the physical coating of nanoparticles with surfactants and the chemical functionalization with specific ligands have been proven to be successful strategies to enhance the BBB crossing through RMT or AMT. Size and charge of the nanoparticles are also aspects that can influence their penetration into the brain. Smaller nanoparticles are able to cross the BBB more easily and to diffuse better through the brain. However, bigger nanoparticles, if correctly functionalized, are also able to cross the BBB, although to a slightly lower extent. Thus, key to increase the amount of drug delivered to the brain is finding the optimal particle size. Larger particles can be loaded with larger amounts of drugs but will reach the brain in lower concentrations, smaller nanoparticles cannot contain large amounts of API but will reach the brain in higher concentrations. By rationally designing nanoparticle systems, the crossing of the BBB in preclinical studies has been successfully demonstrated repeatedly. However, very few clinical data are available on the efficacy of these strategies in the human body. More efforts should now be taken to accelerate the translation of these results into clinical stages, for instance, by focusing on the behavior of the nanoparticles in human blood and investigating the protein corona forming around them, by investigating the particle-cell interactions or by looking for biomimetic solutions. \n\nFigure 2",

            "text": "Drug Delivery Systems. Traditional drug delivery vectors exhibit physicochemical characteristics that limit their ability to pass through biological barriers, in particular the blood-brain barrier, to reach the brain, which is the main target of the polyQ disease therapeutics. To improve the brain bioavailability of therapeutic active agents, new formulations based on nanocarriers have emerged. \n\nEssential requirements for such nanocarriers are high stability and specificity, suitable tissue distribution, satisfactory cell penetration and efficient cytoplasmic or nuclear delivery. 182 Due to the advantage of their size, nanoscale systems have been shown to be efficient drug delivery systems and may be useful for encapsulating drugs, enabling more precise targeting with a controlled release. Their use may address some of the most pressing challenges in drug delivery, such as solubilizing poorly water-soluble drugs, protecting labile drugs from degradation, and delivering drugs selectively to disease sites. These nanosized structures penetrate tissue, facilitate efficient uptake of the drug by cells, enable successful drug delivery, and ensure activity at the targeted location. The uptake of nanostructures by cells is much higher than that of large particles. 188,189 Modifying or functionalizing nanoparticles to deliver drugs through the bloodbrain barrier for targeting maladies of the central nervous system has been one superb outcome of medical nanotechnology. 190 ince a wide variety of nanoparticles made of biological and/or synthetic materials are available, selecting suitable particles relies mainly on the type of therapeutic molecule to be delivered. \n\nNanoparticular carrier systems designed for brain delivery of therapeutic drugs are composed of different materials, including mainly polymers, lipids, metals, or a combination of these materials (Figure 4). In addition, nanoparticle (NP) formulations must provide high biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and protein-mediated opsonization. \u2212195 Lipid-based NPs are widely used as carriers in drug and gene delivery. 193 Various nanostructures have been utilized including solid lipid NPs, liposomes, and micelles (Figure 4).",

It was suggested that the constructed LbL-microcapsules could be suitable for the delivery of NGF to specific populations of brain neurons. In another publication, Fay et al., presented a novel method for the preparation of PEG-free polyion complex nanocarriers for the delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to its target receptor in the brain following intranasal administration [19]. When used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, this new formulation is expected to have a lower immunogenic profile than the previously reported PEG-containing polyion complex. Crucially, this Special Issue is supplemented with a comprehensive review demonstrating that nose-to-brain delivery of therapeutic agents using nanoparticle-based carriers has great potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system disorders [20]. In this article, Lee et al., provided a detailed analysis of the current status of nose-to-brain delivery for nanotherapeutics from various perspectives, including mechanistic biology, transport kinetics, formulations, and clinical applications. \n\nThis Special Issue concludes with two articles that offer a comprehensive overview of nanotoxicology and the characterization techniques used to control and predict the behavior of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Alshawwa et al., discussed the benefits and limitations of commonly used methods for assessing various properties of nanocarriers, such as physicochemical parameters, stability, drug loading efficiency, tissue permeability, and so on [21]. Moreover, the authors discussed the current status and future prospects of the application of artificial intelligence to the development and optimization of nanocarriers. In another review article, Ahmad et al., summarized the trends and challenges in the assessment of nanocarrier safety and toxicity, both in vitro and in vivo [22].

            "text": "Pharmaceutical research aims at identifying new strategies to modify the course of diseases and improve the patient's quality of life. This is certainly an important challenge, especially for therapeutic applications that involve the administration of the drug in specific anatomical sites, such as the central nervous system (CNS). In this region, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which protects the brain parenchyma from the bloodstream, constitutes a major obstacle that impedes therapeutics to carry out their pharmacological action in situ [1,2]. The most immediate strategy to reach the brain is to physically overcome the BBB through direct intrathecal administration. However, this type of method is certainly invasive, painful, and may produce some unfortunate side effects. The use of biocompatible polymer nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery systems is an alternative approach that is gaining growing interest among the possible strategies for the targeted transport of drugs and molecules to the brain for the treatment of all those degenerative diseases involving the CNS [3][4][5]. NPs generally have a diameter between 1 and a few hundred nanometers but NPs with radii of about 100 nm are those with the best pharmacokinetic properties [3,6]. NPs can convey the therapeutic molecule internally (nanocapsules) or by adsorption on their surface (nanospheres). The advantages deriving from the use of nanoparticulate systems concern the possibility of obtaining a controlled and prolonged release of the drug and modifying its distribution and consequent clearance, in order to have, on the one hand, an increase in therapeutic efficacy and on the other hand, a reduction in side effects [3,5]. Moreover, the use of biopolymer-based NPs guarantees, in addition to the specific targeting of the drug or molecule of interest, extremely important peculiarities such as the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the system [3,[7][8][9]. The use of nanocarriers has a very high potential for the administration of therapeutic molecules to the brain as, by virtue of their size, are prone to overcoming anatomical barriers such as BBB.",

            "text": "Summary The delivery of chemotherapies to brain tumors faces the difficult task of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB).1-4 The brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) along with other cell lines, such as astrocytes and pericytes, form the BBB. This highly selective semipermeable barrier separates the blood from the brain parenchyma. The BBB controls the movement of drug molecules in a selective manner5 and maintains central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Depending on the properties of drugs such as their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), some can cross the BBB through passive diffusion.6 However, this approach alone has not led to successful drug developments due to low net diffusion rates and systemic toxicity. Although the use of nanomedicine has been proposed to overcome these drawbacks, many recent studies still rely on the so-called \u2018enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)\u2019 effect though there is a realization in the field of drug delivery that EPR effect may not be sufficient for successful drug delivery to brain tumors. Since, compared to many other solid tumors, brain tumors pose additional challenges such as more restrictive blood-tumor barrier as well as the well-developed lymphatic drainage, the selection of functional moieties on the nanocarriers under consideration must be carried out with care to propose better solutions to this challenge.",

            "text": "B. 5,6 BCECs are classically considered a significant opportunity for brain drug targeting due to a wide-ranging network of receptors and transporters that enable the transport of essential components, including small solutes and large hydrophilic compounds (insulin, transferrin, etc.). The BBB also protects brain tissues and neural cells from pathogenic toxins and is selective for the transport of large size drug molecules via lacking fenestrations for drug uptake. 7,8 It is evident from previous prestigious research that nanocarriers (NCs) targeting is the exceptional approach to treating brain diseases by overcoming the barriers, ie, the BBB. Drug delivery systems (DDS) based on nanocarriers has revolutionized therapeutic applications by improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic patterns of various drugs, allowing them to cross the BBB without disrupting its functionalization. 9 Furthermore, DDS based on nanocarriers have some promising physicochemical and biological characteristics, including long blood circulation time, capacity to cross different barriers, cellular uptake, small size and large surface area, advanced pharmacokinetic features, ability to attach different molecules to their surface, and particular structural characteristics. Additionally, the utilization of nanocarriers led to the development of a highly effective regimen by increasing the therapeutic index and drug concentrations at the target site. 10,11 Furthermore, the latest advances in nanotechnology have anticipated the development of novel nanotherapeutics. For example, by binding to an appropriate ligand, NCs can sustain and target drug cargo directly into the brain, thereby reducing peripheral toxicity. Furthermore, researchers have highlighted some exciting approaches to NCs to increase the drug residence time (DRT) by coupling them with preactivated and thiolated polymers to constrain the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) outflow efficiently. In this regard, various types of nanocarriers, including polymeric micelles, polymeric nanocarriers, dendrimers, liposomal systems (active-targeting, cationic, stimulisensitive conventional and long-circulating), gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots (QDs), were utilized for brain targeting via coupling with identified receptors to cross the BBB proficiently.

            "text": "Similar results were rendered using chitosan nanocarriers designed for pH-sensitive release and enhanced mucoadhesive potential, resulting in improved absorption of anti-diabetic drugs (Wong, 2010). A combination of classical oral delivery formulations and nanotechnologies, e.g., chitosan nanocarriers encased within enteric-coated capsules for insulin delivery, has shown enhanced results, reflecting the potential of nanomedicine to impact oral delivery of active therapeutics (Cui, et al., 2009, Sonaje, et al., 2010). \n\nAnother important cellular barrier encountered by some small molecule therapies is that of the blood-brain interface, which forces more invasive means of local delivery, including direct injection or implantation of the naked therapeutic agent or different scaffolds containing said therapeutic into the brain, e.g., by intracerebral or intraventricular, administration (Menei, et al., 2000, Nakaji-Hirabayashi, et al., 2009, Emerich, et al., 2010). In this regard, prolonged circulation and stability rendered by nanocarriers can enhance the chances of drug diffusion into the brain parenchyma. As discussed in section 2.2.3, carriers targeted to particular transporters of the blood-brain barrier can also improve entry into the central nervous system. Examples illustrating this are those that capitalize on targeting the transferrin receptor, which provides transendothelial transport by a clathirn-mediated mechanism. This has been explored for delivery of nerve growth factor for Huntingon's disease (Kordower, et al., 1994). Nanocarriers have also been used as vehicles to assist in transporting chelating agents into the brain for iron capture and removal in Alzheimer's disease, also with potential in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases (Liu, et al., 2009). Similar nanomedicine strategies can improve delivery of other small molecule therapies for genetic diseases, including hormones to control regulatory pathways, antibiotics, growth factors, cofactors, inhibitors or activators that act upstream or downstream of affected pathways, chaperones that favor proper protein folding, and other chemicals.",

            "text": "Most importantly, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the protective barrier of the central nervous system, limits the delivery of drugs to the brain parenchyma and the sensitivity of the brain to therapeutic effects. Even with the progress of the tumor, the structure and function of BBB are changed after the rupture of the tumor membrane and the deterioration of the tumor. Eventually, BBB is replaced by the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), which hinders the delivery of most anti-tumor drugs (Ningaraj et al., 2002;Zhan and Lu, 2012). About 98% of small molecules and almost all biological macromolecule drugs (such as growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, etc.) cannot enter the central nervous system to exert therapeutic effects (Ren\u00e9 and Parks, 2021). This directly led to the failure of many drugs in clinical trials. \n\nTo circumvent these limitations, researchers have developed various strategies and methods to enhance drug delivery efficiency to the CNS, which mainly include bypassing the BBB, crossing the BBB, and BBB manipulation. A few reviews have summarized the nanotherapeutics for GBM treatment based on the classifications of material types, drug targets, and BBB-penetration mechanisms (Jena et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020). In this review, based on the classification of therapeutic molecule types, we summarize recent progress in this field from the perspective of tailormaking nanotherapeutics for GBM treatment. An overview of BBB and drug delivery strategies to the CNS (Figure 1), examples of nanocarriers for drug delivery, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimer, nanocapsule, and so on (Figure 2), as well as nanotherapeutics that can be delivered across the BBB/ BBTB to effectively treat GBM will be provided (Table 1). At last, perspectives on the future development of nanotherapeutics for GBM management will be also provided.",

            "text": "Transcytosis holds a great potential for drug delivery across different endothelial barriers. Designing efficient 'vectors' (antibodies, protein carriers, viruses, nanoparticles) to deliver therapeutics, especially to the disease-affected brain tissue, in a controlled and non-invasive manner remains one of the key goals of drug development [1]. Careful regulation of material exchange into and out of the brain is essential for the survival of neurons, which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate. This transport is regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. However, it also very efficiently prevents the brain uptake of most therapeutically active compounds. Because of this, many diseases of central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, are undertreated. As a result, various strategies have been developed to improve the access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically necessary concentrations to effectively manage diseases [2,3]. Various drug delivery systems such as: liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles [4], microspheres, nanogels, and bionanocapsules were tested for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS with different efficiancies [5][6][7][8]. Even though transcytosis is often thought to be a selective process, endothelial cells of microvasculature move macromolecular cargo rather nonselectively within the fluid phase of the transport vesicle or by absorption to the vesicle membrane [9]. Using vectors promoting transcytosis in such nonspecific manner can be more widely applied, especially in combination with nanoparticles or liposomes, into which large amounts of a drug can be incorporated [10]. Liposomes seem to be a promising delivery system, which enable high cellular uptake and efficient transcytosis across cellular barriers including the BBB, as their composition can be easily adjusted according to the properties of targeted cells and tissues [11]. It is expected that by a proper choice of liposome composition an efficient transcytosis of liposome entrapped drugs across",

It has been difficult  for drug delivery systems to cross the BBB and ingress into the neural region despite considerable advancement in the field. This makes the treatment of brain diseases very challenging and the success rate with regards to encephalopathy stands very low (Li et al., 2021). RBC membrane cloaking will make it trouble-free for any molecule or nanoparticle to have their way across the BBB as their membrane properties possess the privilege of passing through all the systems of the body. \n\nCurcumin, a multitarget drug, wielded its neuroprotective effects by activating several neurotrophic factors in the brain through various mechanisms. But due to its low water solubility, it has poor bioavailability. The use of curcumin in Alzheimer's disease to make use of its protective effects was achieved by RBCcloaked nanoparticles. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with curcumin was cloaked with RBC membrane and functionalized with DSPE-PEG-T807 with a size of 170 nm which could target at neuronal tau. The RBC protects curcumin by increasing its bioavailability while the T807 helps crossing the BBB with good biocompatibility, and sustained curcumin release (Figure 8B) and prolonged circulation (Figure 10) (Gao et al., 2020a). Another study has been designed with the same nanoparticle for Alzheimer's disease except that human serum albumin was used as a carrier in place of PLGA with a particle size less than 120 nm (Gao et al., 2020b). Both studies have shown good uptakes of the nanoparticles with desired targeting for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Immunotherapeutic effect in glioblastoma therapy was also achieved by using RBC-cloaked nanogels with a size about 131 nm carrying miRNAs. Reinforcement of microglia and macrophages by miRNAs reprograms the immunotherapeutic impact.",

            "text": "The therapeutic potential of NPs exposure depends chiefly on the rate of NP penetration when delivered from the external environment to the internal bio-compartments. Thus, biological barriers are central in determining the biological impact of NP exposure. Nanomaterials offer enormous potential for therapeutics and diagnosis, but also raise the possibility of unintended access to the brain (Herda et al., 2014). In vivo studies showed that NP could be found in the CNS upon various ways of administration (Semmler-Behnke et al., 2008;Zensi et al., 2009Zensi et al., , 2010. In parallel, in vitro models of human and murine BBB have been used and developed for the investigation of NP translocation (Andrieux and Couvreur, 2009;Ragnaill et al., 2011;Bramini et al., 2014;Herda et al., 2014;Raghnaill et al., 2014).\n\nNumerous nano-delivery systems have been proposed and tested for therapeutic purposes, both in vitro and in vivo (Pandey et al., 2015). Amongst the state-of-the-art systems, polymeric NPs are promising because of their high drug encapsulation capacity, so they protect and transport hydrophobic drugs without damaging the BBB structure (Tosi et al., 2008). Binding apolipoprotein E to NPs has been suggested as a mechanism via which NPs could utilize existing pathways to access the brain (Kreuter et al., 2002;Wagner et al., 2012), and it indeed enhances the uptake of drugs (Michaelis et al., 2006). This approach is particularly promising with liposomes, which are highly biocompatible (Re et al., 2011). In general, exploiting receptor-mediated transcytosis by linking specific peptides to the NP surface has been the most studied system in the field of BBB crossing. Various molecules, such as transferrin, insulin, lectin and lipoproteins, physiologically use this route to pass from the blood stream to the brain; thus these ligands could increase the passage ratio of drug-loaded NPs through the BBB for therapeutic purposes (Herda et al., 2014;Pande",

            "text": "The blood\u2013brain barrier acts as a physical barrier that prevents free entry of blood-derived substances, including those intended for therapeutic applications. The development of molecular Trojan horses is a promising drug targeting technology that allows for non-invasive delivery of therapeutics into the brain. This concept relies on the application of natural or genetically engineered proteins or small peptides, capable of specifically ferrying a drug-payload that is either directly coupled or encapsulated in an appropriate nanocarrier, across the blood\u2013brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Specifically, in this process the nanocarrier\u2013drug system (\u201cTrojan horse complex\u201d) is transported transcellularly across the brain endothelium, from the blood to the brain interface, essentially trailed by a native receptor. Naturally, only certain properties would favor a receptor to serve as a transporter for nanocarriers, coated with appropriate ligands. Here we briefly discuss brain microvascular endothelial receptors that have been explored until now, highlighting molecular features that govern the efficiency of nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery into the brain.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles can be delivered past the BBB using various strategies (Fig. 1) and typically can be engineered to help drugs cross the blood-brain barrier without the need to modify the drug itself. Delivery of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier is broadly mediated by two methods: passive accumulation of plain nanocarriers or active targeting of the BBB via ligands on their exosurface that imitate biological entities. Polybutylcyanoacrytlate (PBCA) nanoparticles, for example, can be coated with a surfactant pilysorbate 80, which causes absorption of plasma apolipoprotein E, enabling recognition by LDL-receptor expressed in the brain endothelial cells, and ultimately transcytosis. The diverse nature of nanoparticles and their abilities to cross the BBB and to potentially respond to the tumor microenvironment make them a versatile platform for drug delivery. \n\nLimitations to the use of nanoparticles include poor stability of liposomes, poor biocompatibility, low tumor retention, and suboptimal drug release control. Additionally, characterization and validation of complex nanoparticles can be challenging due to the number of parameters to address, such as size, morphology, charge, purity, drug encapsulation Fig. 1 Drug delivery mechanisms for GBM treatment can be broadly categorized into diffuse delivery (e.g., intravenous or via an Ommaya catheter into the CSF) and targeted delivery (e.g., intra-arterial delivery via selective catheterization, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) targeting the tumor, or polymeric wafers implanted in the resection cavity). These methods can be utilized to deliver traditional chemotherapeutic agents as well as novel drugs, such as nanoparticles, antibody-drug conjugates, or radioimmunotherapy. Focused ultrasound can be utilized to disrupt the blood-brain barrier and ultimately increase delivery of these molecules efficiency, coating efficiency, and density of conjugated ligands. Despite these challenges, ongoing efforts continue to optimize this approach.",

With the help of cutting-edge technology, a variety of natural and synthetic polymers have been successfully engineered to deliver drugs with improved efficiency. Though nanoparticles offer higher drug loading, better bioavailability, etc., nanoparticle-mediated toxicity is yet to be resolved to satisfaction. Hence, extensive research and development is currently focused on initiating controlled drug delivery with less toxicity. Polymers like chitosan are commonly used for drug delivery owing to their biodegradable, biocompatible and mucoadhesive properties. For the past decennium, the concept of biomimetic has been introduced in material design to create more biologically attractive nanocarriers. This could either be achieved by introducing suitable ligands to the CNT surface or by fabricating chitosan nanoparticle with the desired chemical molecule or moiety promoting selfassembly for increased cellular uptake. The successful delivery of a drug to the target region requires not only an ideal nanocarrier but also an effective route of drug administration that enables crossing the blood-brain barrier. However, each route of administration has its advantages and disadvantages when it comes to targeted drug delivery. To overcome the limitations of different administration routes, superior understanding of intercellular, transcellular and other carrier-mediated transporting pathways are essential to develop the next-generation of futuristic nanocarriers. The creation of such an advanced nanotherapeutic system will mark the beginning of a new era in nanotechnology-based drug delivery.",

            "text": "Systemic administration of nanoparticles provides a promising and effective approach towards therapeutics delivery to the brain. The many different synthetic pathways towards polymeric nanoparticles enable careful design of new nanocarriers. The modular fashion in which desired features can be incorporated allows exquisite control over physicochemical properties, which can effectively contribute to overcoming barriers and can help to direct particle interactions with cellular/biological environments. The blood-brain barrier and the mononuclear phagocytic system are critical barriers to deliberate in order to accomplish successful delivery and tissue accumulation. The influences of some nanoparticle properties have been documented extensively-in particular, nanoparticle size, where smaller nanoparticles favor transport across the BBB and brain accumulation, provided that they are not too small (<5 nm) and can avoid clearance by the kidneys. Other nanoparticle properties that affect cell-nanoparticle interactions are still underexplored. Ligand density and stiffness are excellent examples. Their influence on biodistribution, transcytosis, and brain accumulation have been addressed and demonstrated to be relevant parameters, though most literature reports on brain delivery do not characterize or optimize nanocarriers regarding these parameters. The examples discussed in this review also illustrate how good design and thorough characterization are valuable in the development of delivery systems. \n\nWe have brought here an overview of the properties of polymeric nanoparticles that influence brain delivery, illustrated with examples that point out the importance of comprehensive particle characterization. Particularly in view of targeting ligands, much remains to be explored and understood concerning avidity, ligand density, and protein corona formation. Importantly, no property can singly outline the brain delivery capabilities of a drug delivery system, making every particle unique. Valuable trends can, however, be extrapolated, unraveling important design criteria for novel nanocarriers that can reliably gain access to the brain.",

            "text": "Because of their ability to transport bioactive molecules like proteins and encoding and non-coding RNAs between cells and organs, extracellular vesicles play a crucial role in cellular signaling [15]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) [16], AAV vectors [17], erythrocyte membrane-encapsulated nanocarriers [18], cell-based delivery nanocarriers [19], injectable hydrogels [20], immunomodulators [21], and many other drug delivery technologies have been created to bypass the BBB. Surprisingly, EVs outperformed them all. \n\nRecently, exosomes have been identified as the most reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and the most efficient drug transporters for treating diseases [22][23][24]. Exosomes are endogenous, have good pharmacokinetics and unique immunological characteristics, and may pass physiological barriers, making them superior to synthetic drug delivery vectors like liposomes and nanoparticles [25]. Additional functionalities can be used upon exosomes and for site-specific medication delivery to surface changes [26]. When taken as a whole, these characteristics of exosomes make them helpful in identifying and treating central nervous system disorders. \n\nExosomes can deliver bioactive substances through a variety of pathways and safely and efficiently transfer bioactive substances to participate in cell metabolisms, such as tissue repair [27], immune regulation [28], and tumor therapy [29]. Exosomes can carry genetic material, have stable lipid membrane structure, and are widely distributed in body fluids and other essential characteristics of delivery carriers. These have gradually become an important direction of disease research as therapeutic carriers. The complex blood-brain barrier (BBB) exists in the central nervous system, which means the treatment of its diseases has certain limitations [30]. To some extent, the brain is shielded by a semipermeable but highly selective barrier called the blood-brain barrier. However, some therapeutic medications have trouble crossing the blood-brain barrier [31]. Exosomes' delivery carrier benefits allow them to traverse the blood-brain barrier with their cargo. Consequently, it is imperative to research medicine delivery based on exosomes [32,33].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology can provide many advantages to modern medicine. This includes highly specific targeted drug delivery, better biocompatibility, increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced toxicity, multi-functionalization, long circulation time, and controlled drug release at the targeted site (Choi and Han, 2018;Padmanabhan et al., 2020). Possible approaches to treating PD can be through inhibition of \u03b1-syn expression, inhibition of aggregation process, immunotherapy, and the promotion of \u03b1-syn degradation. Table 1 lists the different nanocarriermediated strategies of targeting PD.\n\nA major challenge in designing a therapeutic strategy for the brain is the crossing of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a semi-permeable membrane that selectively restricts the diffusion of foreign materials from the peripheral blood to the CNS (Daneman and Prat, 2015). Many drugs have shown promise in PD treatment but failed to cross the BBB. The inability to cross BBB prevents the drugs from reaching their target sites and an adequate accumulation of drugs at the sites to exert significant therapeutic effect. The development of nanocarriers may help in overcoming this challenge. Nanocarriers can be functionalized to cross the BBB, target desired cells, and allow a sustained release of therapeutics to specific brain targets . Moreover, nanocarriers can protect encapsulated drugs from premature degradation to maximize the drug therapeutic efficacy. Hence, an increasing number of nanocarriers have been approved for clinical uses (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2019). Several studies have successfully used nanocarriers to improve the delivery of PD therapeutic drugs and dopamine across BBB (Barcia et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018;Jahansooz et al., 2020). The use of nanocarriers was reported to not only help improve the therapeutic efficacy, but also reduce drug side effects. Although these results are commendable, delivery of PD drugs and dopamine only work to relieve PD symptoms but do not resolve \u03b1-syn aggregation. Considering this, recent studies have turned to the employment of nanocarriers to deliver antioxidants that are capable of inhibiting \u03b1-syn fibrillation and reducing inflammation in the brain. Accumulation of toxic \u03b1-syn aggregates",

During the last decade, several new technologies were developed to overcome barrier properties of cerebral capillaries. This review gives a short overview of the structural elements and anatomical features of the blood\u2013brain barrier. The various in vitro (static and dynamic), in vivo (microdialysis), and in situ (brain perfusion) blood\u2013brain barrier models are also presented. The drug formulations and administration options to deliver molecules effectively to the central nervous system (CNS) are presented. Nanocarriers, nanoparticles (lipid, polymeric, magnetic, gold, and carbon based nanoparticles, dendrimers, etc.), viral and peptid vectors and shuttles, sonoporation and microbubbles are briefly shown. The modulation of receptors and efflux transporters in the cell membrane can also be an effective approach to enhance brain exposure to therapeutic compounds. Intranasal administration is a noninvasive delivery route to bypass the blood\u2013brain barrier, while direct brain administration is an invasive mode to target the brain region with therapeutic drug concentrations locally. Nowadays, both technological and mechanistic tools are available to assist in overcoming the blood\u2013brain barrier. With these techniques more effective and even safer drugs can be developed for the treatment of devastating brain disorders.",

            "text": "Despite the presence of potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), efficient treatment of central nervous system-(CNS-) related diseases remains a major challenge in pharmacotherapy. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) that maintains the homeostasis of the brain excludes many small and large molecule drugs from the CNS [1,2]. To reach therapeutic concentrations of systemic administered drugs in the CNS, high doses are often required. This is linked with an increased risk for toxic side effects. Therefore, different strategies for effective drug transfer across the BBB are currently under investigation [3]. Besides chemical optimization of the API and invasive delivery techniques, targeting of transporters and receptors expressed on BBB endothelial cells is a promising way to specifically deliver drugs to the CNS [3]. Endogenous macromolecules can cross the BBB by receptormediated transport and thus reach the brain despite their size as shown for insulin [4,5] and transferrin [6]. Antibodies can mimic these endogenous ligands and transport bound drugs, macromolecules, or nanoparticles across the BBB in vivo. For example, the enzyme N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH) was conjugated to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the human insulin receptor (HIR). Recombinant SGSH was not able to cross the BBB. However, it was possible to reach therapeutic concentrations in the brain after injection of the mAb fusion protein in Rhesus monkeys [7]. While antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) provide specific targeting to a distinctive tissue or cell type, their drug carrying capacity is very limited. Nanocarriers can exceed the drug payload of ADCs by three to four orders of magnitude [8]. Within these nanocarriers, self-assembled micelles consisting of biodegradable diblock copolymers are extensively studied as drug delivery systems (DDS) [9]. Their hydrophobic core serves as a reservoir for poorly soluble drugs, sterically stabilized by a hydrophilic corona [10]. Polymeric micelles can prevent premature drug degradation, reduce off-target effects, and increase bioavailability.",

            "text": "in nanomedicine the nanocarriers are generally biocompatible, biodegradable with rapid biodistribution in the body and can be used to carry drugs or therapeutic genes. thus, new drug delivery systems have been heavily exploited in the treatment of CNS disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and glioma, since the CNS is a major challenge for therapeutic approaches due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB). Thus, the scientific community together with government and private industry has added efforts to generate new formulations in nanoscale in order to achieve an appropriate therapeutic approach, satisfying, and that is within the principles of health monitoring for cerebral affections. this article aims to summarize the knowledge about the main barriers to drug delivery to the CNS, Nanomedicine, glioma, Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and sanitary surveillance.

            "text": "A major problem is that the delivery of most chemotherapeutic and molecular targeted agents, including MAPK inhibitors, is abrogated by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [7,8]. For many years, different strategies have been investigated to facilitate BBB crossing of therapeutic agents [9]. A promising novel avenue is the use of nanotechnology, i.e. the use of molecular devices (nanocarriers) with a diameter ranging from 5 to 500 nm for drug delivery to the brain [10,11]. Various nanotechnology-based approaches like micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, dendrimers and solid lipid nanoparticles have been studied and tested for glioma treatment [9,unpublished]. Liposomes have extensively been tested for drug delivery and various formulations are tested in clinical trials [12]. Polymeric carriers (polymersomes) are superior over liposomes in terms of a better loading capability, longer blood circulation time, less drug leakage and larger storage capacity [9]. Further advantages include the lower drug toxicity by controlled drug release and improved drug pharmacokinetics via increased drug stability and solubility [13]. Polymeric vesicles are characterized with an aqueous core surrounded by a hydrophobic bi-layer membrane composed of amphiphilic block copolymers (Fig. 1, [14]), allowing loading of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents. Polymersomes are highly versatile and biologically stable, and drug encapsulation and release capabilities can be modulated [15]. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated MEK162 loaded polymeric nanocarriers in combination with irradiation and TMZ on human brain U87MG tumour cells growing as 3D spheroid. Blood-brain barrier passaging was studied in an in vitro transwell BBB model with human vascular endothelial cells.",

            "text": "One of the main obstacles that inhibit the development of effective medications for the prevention and treatment of AD is the selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents brain penetration of a large number of central nervous system (CNS) drugs [14,15,18]. As a consequence, only less than 5% of APIs are able enter the brain by passive diffusion [19]; mainly molecules with low molecular weight (Mw), lipid solubility and a small, positive charge [1,[20][21][22][23][24][25]. The other major obstacle in the systemic treatment of brain diseases is that many CNS drugs have to be administered at high doses to reach satisfactory therapeutic efficacy, which results in severe peripheral side-effects [26,27]. In an attempt to overcome limitations represented by the BBB, various colloidal delivery systems have been developed in the last two decades that exploit the benefits of particle size reduction, such as polymeric NPs, liposomes, metal NP-based carriers, solid-lipid NPs, cubosomes and emulsions [28]. Among these nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles (NP) seem to be particularly suitable for the enhancement of drug pharmacokinetics, as they are able to mask the BBB transport limiting physicochemical properties of API molecules [24]. Polymeric nanocarriers are also ideal tools to reduce peripheral side effects, either by facilitating sustained drug discharge [29][30][31] or by enabling controlled API release via the incorporation of stimuli-responsive building blocks [32]. Polymeric carriers can bind drugs either covalently and non-covalently, as well as are able to carry both hydrophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic compounds [33]. Furthermore, polymer-based NPs exhibit an array of additional benefits, such high stability, facile production, high encapsulation efficacy, possibility for sterilization, easy modification with targeting ligands and multifunctional nature [19].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprises a specialized network of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, acting as a defense mechanism to prevent the extravasation of materials. Tight junctions between adjacent brain endothelial cells limit paracellular transport, restricting the passive entry of molecules to a narrow range of size and lipophilicity. These formidable physical and functional barriers impede the exposure of drugs to intracranial tissues. Tight junctions commonly exclude hydrophilic small molecules from entering the brain, and although many lipophilic drugs can passively diffuse, their penetration into diseased brain tissue is often inefficient. This inefficiency typically necessitates high drug doses, leading to dose-limiting systemic toxicity [105,106]. In light of the numerous challenges associated with the passage of small molecules through the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles have been investigated as a potential means to enhance drug delivery to brain tissues [107]. Much of the current research has concentrated on improving the passive transport mechanisms of drug-loaded nanoparticles across the BBB. For example, in diseases where the BBB is compromised, such as glioblastoma, nanostructures have been observed to extravasate through leaky vasculature, accumulating at tumor sites. \n\nSimilarly, strategies have been developed to enhance drug delivery across an intact BBB by initially disrupting this barrier [108][109][110][111]. However, such approaches, while allowing unregulated passage across the BBB, may compromise the BBB's homeostatic functions and expose the brain to harmful toxins and pathogens [112]. In contrast, alternative approaches for diseases like SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, where the BBB remains intact, involve the use of nontargeting nanocarriers to prolong the systemic circulation of small-molecule drugs, and over a relatively long time, an appreciable number of drugs would cross the BBB. Nevertheless, this has only partially improved on-target toxicity profiles at high doses [112].",

            "text": "Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) acts as a highly impermeable barrier, presenting an impediment to the crossing of most classical drugs targeted for neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). About the nature of drugs and other potential molecules, they impose unavoidable dose-restricted limitations eventually leading to the failure of therapy. However, many advancements in formulation technology and modification of delivery approaches have been successful in delivering the drug to the brain in the therapeutic window. The nose to the brain (N2B) drug delivery employing the nanoformulation, is one such emerging delivery approach, overcoming both classical drug formulation and delivery-associated limitations. This latter approach offers increased bioavailability, greater patient acceptance, lesser metabolic degradation of drugs, circumvention of BBB, ample drug loading along with the controlled release of the drugs. In N2B delivery, the intranasal (IN) route carries therapeutics firstly into the nasal cavity followed by the brain through olfactory and trigeminal nerve connections linked with nasal mucosa. The N2B delivery approach is being explored for delivering other biologicals like neuropeptides and mitochondria. Meanwhile, this N2B delivery system is associated with critical challenges consisting of mucociliary clearance, degradation by enzymes, and drug translocations by efflux mechanisms. These challenges finally culminated in the development of suitable surface-modified nano-carriers and Focused- Ultrasound-Assisted IN as FUS-IN technique which has expanded the horizons of N2B drug delivery. Hence, nanotechnology, in collaboration with advances in the IN route of drug administration, has a diversified approach for treating PD. The present review discusses the physiology and limitation of IN delivery along with current advances in nanocarrier and technical development assisting N2B drug delivery.",

            "text": "In parallel, for those drug candidates that are not capable of successfully crossing the blood-CNS barriers, there is the possibility of transvascular delivery to the brain. It has been demonstrated that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can actively transport lipophilic drugs out of the capillary endothelial cells in brain, leading to minimizing or avoiding neurotoxic adverse effects of drugs. However, efflux transporters may also limit the central distribution of drugs that are beneficial to treat CNS diseases. Therefore, modulation of efflux transporters at the BBB can be considered as a novel strategy to enhance the penetration of drugs into the brain, especially for drug-resistant CNS diseases (10,11). \n\nAn alternative way for drug delivery to the brain is to use delivery systems that facilitate the movement of drug candidate across the blood-CNS barrier (8,9,12). Polymeric micelles are one of the promising nanomedicine-based technologies which have been evaluated as nanocarriers for anticancer drugs (13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18). Polymeric micelles are kinetically stable nanoparticles with a core-shell structure which are made from amphiphilic block copolymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains that self-assemble in water above the critical micelle concentration. The hydrophobic core of these nano-carriers could serve as a microenvironment for solubilizing poorly water soluble drugs through hydrophobic interaction and/or hydrogen bonding and protect the enclosed compounds from inactivation in biological media, while exposing their hydrophilic shells to the external environment (9, 13). In addition, these systems exhibit many advantages, among which small particle size (less than 100 nm), targeting ability, ease of preparation and prolonged circulation time (the ability to escape from renal exclusion and reticuloendothelial system) could be mentioned (9,13,(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24).",

However, the presence of BBB complicates the pharmacotherapy for CNS disorders as the most chemical drugs and biopharmaceuticals have been impeded to enter the brain. Insufficient drug delivery into the brain leads to low therapeutic efficacy as well as aggravated side effects due to the accumulation in other organs and tissues. Recent breakthrough in materials science and nanotechnology provides a library of advanced materials with customized structure and property serving as a powerful toolkit for targeted drug delivery. In-depth research in the field of anatomical and pathological study on brain and BBB further facilitates the development of brain-targeted strategies for enhanced BBB crossing. In this review, the physiological structure and different cells contributing to this barrier are summarized. Various emerging strategies for permeability regulation and BBB crossing including passive transcytosis, intranasal administration, ligands conjugation, membrane coating, stimuli-triggered BBB disruption, and other strategies to overcome BBB obstacle are highlighted. Versatile drug delivery systems ranging from organic, inorganic, and biologics-derived materials with their synthesis procedures and unique physio-chemical properties are summarized and analyzed. This review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive guideline for researchers in diverse fields, offering perspectives on further development of brain-targeted drug delivery system.",

In drug delivery field, nanoscale drug delivery systems have already started to exhibit immense potential due to many incomparable advantages. Such advantages include but are not limited to decreased side effects, prolonged blood circulation, and increased drug stability, bioavailability and targeting efficiency 10,11 . Besides, versatile nanocarriers could simultaneously carry imaging agents, therapeutic drugs and targeting ligands, which is beneficial for tracing drug distribution, activating drug release from an external stimulus (e.g., laser light, temperature, or ultrasound), and theoretically detecting potentially dangerous drug accumulation. Based on all these advantages, nanoscale drug delivery systems have found renowned attention in tumor-targeting imaging and drug therapy 99 . Due to the rapid expansion of nanotechnology, various types of nanocarriers have been developed, for example, liposomes, micelles and various nanoparticles (NPs, Fig. 8). \n\nNanoscale brain-targeting drug delivery systems have great perspectives for drug management of brain diseases. For this application, the nanocarriers should be capable of overcoming the BBB, and improving diagnostics and drug therapy efficiency. With subtle design, the functionalization could assist the translocation of nanocarriers across the BBB and provide satisfactory BBB permeation 100 . Endogenous and exogenous specific ligands and substrates have been extensively used to enhance the efficiency of BBB crossing and brain-targeting delivery via binding with specific CMT or RMT on the BBB 3,4,101,102 . For example, transferrin, lactoferrin, glucose, polysorbate 80 and anti-TfR antibodies have been developed as brain targeting ligands and have shown high Diseased BBB-based brain-targeting delivery strategies efficiency in amplifying BBB penetration and brain delivery of nanocarriers 41,103e110 .",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are the leading causes of death and disabilities in the world. It is quite challenging to treat CNS diseases efficiently because of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). It is a physical barrier with tight junction proteins and high selectivity to limit the substance transportation between the blood and neural tissues. Thus, it is important to understand BBB transport mechanisms for developing novel drug carriers to overcome the BBB. This paper introduces the structure of the BBB and its physiological transport mechanisms. Meanwhile, different strategies for crossing the BBB by using nanomaterial-based drug carriers are reviewed, including carrier-mediated, adsorptive-mediated, and receptor-mediated transcytosis. Since the viral-induced CNS diseases are associated with BBB breakdown, various neurotropic viruses and their mechanisms on BBB disruption are reviewed and discussed, which are considered as an alternative solution to overcome the BBB. Therefore, most recent studies on virus-mimicking nanocarriers for drug delivery to cross the BBB are also reviewed and discussed. On the other hand, the routes of administration of drug-loaded nanocarriers to the CNS have been reviewed. In sum, this paper reviews and discusses various strategies and routes of nano-formulated drug delivery systems across the BBB to the brain, which will contribute to the advanced diagnosis and treatment of CNS diseases.",

            "text": "The tight junctions of the microvascular endothelial cell lining in the cerebral capillary walls form the BBB [14]. The presence of various cell types (astrocytes, pericytes, microglia and endothelial cells) and the high selectivity of the BBB maintain a highly controlled environment in the brain. The entry of pathogens, large or hydrophilic molecules and the diffusion of solutes in the blood is restricted, whereas some small molecules (such as O2 and CO2) can move across the BBB through diffusion. Despite this, only approximately 2% of all small molecules can cross the BBB [14]. Therefore, due to difficulties in crossing the BBB and the removal of drugs by efflux pumps, drug delivery into the brain via the oral and intravenous routes is particularly challenging. Nanoparticles present unique opportunities in crossing the BBB owing to the flexibility in the modifications of their sizes, shapes, surfaces and physiochemical properties based on different synthesis and functionalisation processes. Nanoparticles are small particles (typically 1 to 100 nm in diameter) that can be synthesised from a range of organic, inorganic and carbon-based materials. Nanoparticles show size-dependent permeation across the BBB. A 2020 study investigated the optimal brain delivery size using gold nanoparticles enhanced by focused-ultrasound-induced BBB opening. It was reported that nanoparticles ranging from 3 to 200 nm are able to permeate through the BBB, and while smaller nanoparticles show greater permeation across the BBB, larger nanoparticles (200 nm) show greater accumulation in the brain due to slower clearance from the blood [15]. Furthermore, different functionalisation and conjugation strategies, for instance, the incorporation of specific ligands, have been shown to improve the targeting effects of drug delivery nanosystems. Here, we review various nanosystems that have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents against AD and summarise their key properties (Table 1). Liposomes are small, spherical vesicles that contain one or multiple phospholipid bilayers, which can be synthesised from cholesterol or non-toxic phospholipids.",

Brain-targeted drug delivery systems has been developed in last few recent years and gained large attention. The obstruction posed by BBB toward therapeutic drugs against diseased part of brain tissues, braintargeted drug delivery systems seems to be the most promising strategy to address our natural defense system. A clear perceptive toward the functions of brain cells such as microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and neural stem cells in neurodisorders pathology is requisite in order to develop successful novel targeted-drug delivery systems. Even though, several nanoformulations have shown great efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, their clinical translation from bench to bedside is not very successful due to inadequate information about their final fate in terms of toxicity, and other problems like aggregation and rapid clearance due to nano-size. Indepth and complete toxicological studies of brain targeting nanoformulations with their clear mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics with and without therapeutics should be essentially investigated. Besides this, more research has to be done in order to determine the fate of nanocarriers inside body, their systemic toxicity, biocompatibility, and RES elimination. The therapeutic potential of nanomedicine will rely on the rational approach and further designing of nanomaterials based on detailed and comprehensive knowledge of obtained from biological processes. Several basic concerns should be addressed in the future to achieve the successful clinical translation of nanoformulations: \n\n(i) The nanomaterials should be biodegradable in nature and provide effective and safe brain-targeted drug delivery systems. (ii) An eco-friendly green approach should be developed for preparation of nanoformulations. (iii) The factors like shape, size, charge and moiety attached to nanomaterials should be well elucidated and evaluated, which is essential for crossing and developing braintargeted drug delivery systems. (iv) A non-invasive alternative method for nanocarrier drug delivery should be developed in order to avoid complications such as poor patient compliance associated with i.v., and other invasive routes.",

            "text": "Nanocarriers demonstrate potential as a drug delivery system for treating brain dysfunction. They possess the ability to resist drug degradation, enhance drug metabolism kinetics, and improve neurovascular pathways. Nevertheless, the blood-brain barrier poses a significant challenge in the therapeutic process by restricting drug transportation into the brain. To overcome this obstacle, nanoparticles are modified to enhance the likelihood and concentration of drug delivery to the ischemic site by crossing the blood-brain barrier. 80 The primary methods for nano-delivery systems to traverse the blood-brain barrier include passive diffusion, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated transport, and carrier-mediated transport. 81 rombolysis therapy. Encapsulated thrombolytic agents have been developed to deliver the enzyme tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the target area at a controllable rate. This helps temporarily inhibit tPA activity in the circulation, extending its half-life and improving its contact with the clot. 3][84] Researchers have also developed silicon-coated magnetic nanoparticles (SiO 2 -MNP) as biocompatible carriers for targeted delivery of tPA. 25 In addition, SPIONs stabilized by a dextran shell have been created as a magnetite drug carrier for targeted thrombolysis under an applied magnetic field. 26 Cyclic RGD (cRGD) functionalized liposomes have been employed to encapsulate thrombolytic drugs 27 (Figure 3D). In 2018, Vankayala et al. identified a nanostructured system that consists of vesicles from erythrocytes encapsulated with near-infrared fluorophores (ICGs) and a tPA affixed to the vesicle surface. This system effectively prolongs the half-life of tPA and reduces the risk of bleeding. 85 Xu et al. developed platelet membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles (nanoplatelets) that deliver tPA to localized thrombus sites. In an animal model of thrombosis, these tailored nanoplatelets aggregated efficiently at the thrombus and demonstrated significantly enhanced thrombolytic activity compared to free rt-PA (Figures 3A and 3B). 28,30",

            "text": "However, the presence of the BBB and the Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier (BCSFB) limits the therapeutic success of these pharmaceutical formulations. These barriers serve as the brain's biochemical and physiological defense mechanisms (Sharma et al., 2012). The presence of the BBB, along with enzyme interactions and restricted entry of pharmaceutical agents, renders various treatments ineffective (Whiting, 2013). For effective therapy of neuronal disorders, drugs must be highly lipophilic and have a molecular weight ranging from 400 to 600 Da (Wong et al., 2012). Moreover, nanoparticles, in combination with pharmaceutical active ingredients, offer an efficient brain targeting approach for multiple therapies (Alam et al., 2010). Crossing the BBB remains a major challenge in drug delivery. Hydrophilic drugs are transported through specific carrier-mediated endocytosis and the paracellular route, while lipid-soluble drugs are transported via diffusion and P-glycoprotein (Jyoti et al., 2018). Nanogels, known for their non-toxic nature, high drug loading efficiency, and improved BBB permeability, present a promising option (Leonard and G\u00e9rard, 2010).

These carriers have been investigated in nano-medicine; they not only help in the formulation of drugs but also provide the sustained release of drugs at the targeted sites. For the enhanced delivery of drugs, these nanoparticles are combined with diagnostic probes and designed to target sites which are hard to reach (Xu et al., 2013). Nanoparticles are important in biomedical applications because of their small sizes as the blood-brain barrier prevents crossing of drugs with large sizes such as proteins, chemicals, and peptides. To pass drugs from the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles and CQDs can be used to deliver drugs in targeted sites, but it is essential to keep the sizes of these nanoparticles less than the size of the capillaries for use in the living body. These nano-sized particles stop the blockage of blood vessels and eliminate them from the body by the reticuloendothelial system. In brain tumors, the delivery of imaging probes to the tumor is difficult because of the blood-brain barrier. It is dependent upon the size of this imaging probe and its topography. According to Li et al., CQDs have been observed in different organs of mice after 6 h of their injection and showed bright fluorescence. Some of them are also observed in the brain, which indicates that CQDs can enter the brain and have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (Li N. et al., 2012). For the in vivo fluorescence imaging, polymer-coated nitrogen-doped CQDs can also be used, and these CQDs have the ability to enter the glioma cells. Because of the presence of hydrophilic polymer coating on the nitrogendoped CQD surface, they have enhanced ability to circulate in the bloodstream and target the site of interest of the cancerous area. This suggests that polymer-coated N-doped CQDs can enhance the blood-brain barrier crossing and then increase their accumulation for glioma imaging .",

As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.",

            "text": "Comprised of hundreds of various highly organized subtypes of neurons and glia, the central nervous system is the most complex and specialized body system. Similarly, the central nervous system disorders are equally complex, with each causing a collection of diagnostically definitive disruptions in behavior [32]. Consequently, the strategies for the treatment of these disorders are insufficient due to the existence of the blood brain barrier, which is comprised of various cell types, cellular interfaces with tight junctions, extracellular matrix components, and transporter mechanisms. The blood brain barrier is a selective permeability system that is responsible for the protection of the brain tissue against the exposure to foreign substances through the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid [33]. Hence, a limited amount of drug enters the central nervous system, which is insufficient for the treatment of brain diseases. Therefore, novel strategies for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain, such as nanotechnology approaches, are necessary for an effective treatment of central nervous system disorders [34]. The use of nanoparticles to diagnose brain diseases or to assist the delivery of drugs across the blood brain barrier has gained a great interest, since they offer a series of advantages, namely targeting efficiency, non-invasiveness, biodegradability, stability, and controllability to load and release drugs [35].",

            "text": "Consequently, lipid-soluble compounds can pass freely through all endothelial membranes and easily cross the BBB [61]. Various different strategies are mentioned in recent studies, including direct injection, nose-to-brain route, the opening of BBB, inhibition of efflux transporters, and use of nanocarrier [62]; however, among these strategies, nanocarrier seems to be the most appropriate and result-oriented. \n\nUsing cutting-edge therapeutic nano-delivery devices may solve the problem of crossing the BBB [63][64][65][66][67]. Because of their distinctive physicochemical features and capacity to penetrate the BBB, engineered NPs < 100 nm have multiple applications in resolving these biological and pharmacological problems [68]. The ability of NP to cross the BBB increases the likelihood of early diagnosis and successful treatment of neurological diseases [69]. However, six different access routes that could be used to cross the BBB are paracellular diffusion (hydrophilic molecule), transcellular diffusion, carrier-mediated transport, receptor-mediated transport, adsorptive-mediated transport, and cell-mediated transport [62]. Paracellular transport is a passive transport process that results in the transport of substances across an epithelium. Tight junctions are the major rate-limiting pathway in the paracellular transport of large molecules across the epithelium [70]. Large molecules such as polypeptides are generally excluded from paracellular diffusion due to their hydrophilicity and high molecular mass. Adsorption-mediated transcytosis has attracted much attention because of its potential for large-molecule drug delivery to the brain. Cationic albumin-mediated brain DDS is commonly used; however, coupling this component with NP DDS is proven to be successful in cross-BBB for CNS delivery. Polymeric NPs are commonly used for adsorption-mediated transcytosis [71]. Immunocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes have a high degree of mobility, and they can cross various barriers to reach the target site and release their medication cargo. To enhance drug delivery, these cells can be loaded with nanocarriers such as polymeric NPs.",

With regard to RA therapies, the possible application of HA-based polymeric nanocarriers is closely linked to the ability of HA to bind CD44, which is overexpress in synovial fibroblasts and tissue [80]. Another possible application of HA-based polymeric nanoparticles that has not been explored yet is the delivery of drugs through the BBB, mainly for brain cancer treatment, given HA ability to target these cells. It is a well-known fact that delivery of drugs to the brain is a major challenge due to the inability of drugs, mainly the hydrophilic ones, to cross BBB. Nanocarriers have come as a possible solution to this problem. In particular, polymeric nanosystems have proven to be capable of crossing this barrier, [5,7,32] thus making HA-based polymeric nanocarriers excellent candidates for therapies against glioblastoma.",

            "text": "Decades of dedicated efforts have led to scientific advances in understanding the physiology of many diseases and development of a wide array of therapeutic materials. To fulfil their intended purpose, therapeutic materials must have adequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can allow them to accumulate in the diseased site in their therapeutically effective concentration. Advances in the treatment of infections or malignancies residing in peripheral tissues are growing at a faster pace compared to their CNS-associated equivalents. In large part, this phenomenon is due to the inability of the therapeutic material to cross brain barriers from the systemic circulation into brain parenchymal tissues. In this review, we describe the anatomical structure of brain barriers with a focus on the major contributor to the brain's strict permeability. We review excerpts of CNS drug delivery approaches available for clinical use or still undergoing clinical or preclinical trials. We also highlight the principles underlying their mechanism of action and bring out some of their advantages and limitations. Finally, we attempt to follow their progress as they weave their way from preclinical investigation to clinical use.\n\nTargeted drug delivery has found applications in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, such as cancer [1], diabetes [2] and neurodegenerative diseases [3]. As yet, neurodegenerative diseases remain an area where targeted drug delivery is most needed, since surgical treatments are not always an option and a treatment at a molecular level is needed. Additionally, intravenously injected neurotherapeutic materials not only have to evade en route biological barriers, such as solubility in the solubility in the blood stream, stability against enzymatic degradation and phagocytosis, but also barriers interposed between the systemic circulation and brain tissues [4]. Barriers of the central nervous system (CNS) are made of specialized cells that lie at the interface between blood and nervous tissues, forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and between blood and cerebrospinal fluid, forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) Figure 1 [5][6][7][8][9]. These specialized cells express transmembrane proteins with which they can seal off the intercellular space protecting brain tissues from micro-organisms, toxic",

Traditional methods of delivering drugs to the CNS face considerable limitations. Nose-to-brain targeting offers a promising alternative that bypasses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling targeted drug administration to the central nervous system (CNS). Nanotechnology has brought forward innovative solutions to the challenges of drug delivery in CNS disorders. Nanocarriers such as liposomes, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions and dendrimers can enhance drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery to the brain. These nanocarriers are designed to overcome physiological barriers and provide controlled and sustained drug release directly to the CNS. Nanocarrier technology has made significant strides in recent years, enabling more effective and targeted delivery of drugs to the brain. With recent advancements, intranasal delivery coupled with nanocarriers seems to be a promising combination that can provide better clinical profiles, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics for neurodegenerative disorders. This study focuses on exploring the nose-to-brain drug delivery system, emphasizing the use of various nanocarriers designed for this purpose. Additionally, the study encompasses recent advancements in nanocarrier technology tailored specifically to improve the efficiency of drug administration through the nasal route to the brain.",

The widening of BBB tight junctions via focused ultrasound (FUS) offers a promising approach for enhancing the delivery of nanoparticles into the brain. However, there is currently an insufficient understanding of how nanoparticles pass through the opened BBB gaps. \n\nHere we investigated the size-dependence of nanoparticle delivery into the brain assisted by FUSinduced BBB opening, using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of 3, 15, and 120 nm diameter. For 3-and 15-nm AuNPs, FUS exposure significantly increased permeation across an in vitro BBB model by up to 9.5 times, and the permeability was higher with smaller diameter. However, in vivo transcranial FUS exposure in mice demonstrated that smaller particles were not necessarily better for delivery into the brain. Medium-sized (15 nm) AuNPs showed the highest delivery efficiency (0.22% ID), compared with 3-and 120-nm particles. A computational model suggested that this optimum size was determined by the competition between their permeation through opened BBB gaps and their excretion from blood. Our results would greatly contribute to designing nanoparticles for their delivery into the brain for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. \n\nNanoparticles have attracted global attention in the biomedical field. It has been revealed that their interaction with cells and/or tissues can be tailored through nanoparticle design, such as their size, shape, and surface chemistry 1 . Combined with the advances in nanoparticle functionalization methods, this has opened the way for various biomedical applications of nanoparticles, including drug delivery, imaging, and therapies 2,3 .",

            "text": "Modern medicine faces a significant obstacle in developing therapies that can achieve precision, efficiency and personalization for individual patients. In particular, the demand for technologies with modulation, therapeutical and monitoring capabilities to be applied in the brain is vast and diverse and achieving successful outcomes in this field remains a formidable task, with the majority of neuroscience diseases being highly dependent on therapeutical approaches with lack of specificity and side-effects. Innovative therapeutics discussed in this review are represented in Figure 6 regarding drug-delivery, tumor-targeting and biomarker detection applications. \n\nThe transcranial delivery of central nervous system (CNS) drugs is a large challenge for translating the advances in drug development research to clinical practice, mainly related to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), with the role to protect the brain from harmful substances while regulating the entry of essential nutrients. As a consequence, the efficiency of drug delivery is commonly low, which requires high doses of most CNS-targeted drugs, applied with reduced specificity, commonly leading to severe side effects in peripheral organs (Obermeier et al., 2013). Therefore, efficient BBB-crossing brain delivery systems are crucial to enhance therapeutic outcomes while avoiding adverse systemic effects. Several nanoparticle-based approaches have been explored for localized and specific drug-delivery systems. A promising and crescently used NPs class for the goal of non-invasive targeting and monitoring strategies are MNPs. Due to its superparamagnetic properties, it became possible to target specific cells and tissues through the local application of non-invasive magnetic forces. The well-structured and rigid architecture of MNPs provides a stable binding site for various diagnostic or therapeutic agents. Besides, external control over the movement of MNPs increases their ability to reach the target site, reducing their peripheral circulation time compared to other nanocarriers (Sagar et al., 2016) 6A). The recent advances in optics and photonics have led to the development of nanoparticles combining both diagnostic and therapeutic properties -the commonly known theranostic nanoparticles -that have been exploited with great results in therapy, real-time monitoring and diagnosis.",

In line with the overall increase in knowledge and nanotechnologies, surface engineering of nano-sized carriers is now representing the cutting edge of nanomedicine, leading to the production of selectively targeted therapies based on targeted nanocarriers. In fact, achieving nanocarriers able to be stable in the blood-stream, to protect the drug from metabolism and to promote a long-lasting release of the drug is still a pivotal pre-requisite for nanomedicine, but it is now to be considered as ''not enough''. Active targeting to specific pathological cells is now the challenge of pharmaceutical nanotechnologists, who are facing with difficulties in colloidal chemistry and most of all in the characterization of the engineered nanocarriers from a technological and physiological points of view. As an example, the application of nanotechnology to brain-related disorders, called nanoneuromedicine, is surely representing one of the most stimulating challenge as well as one the most difficult due to the presence of biological barriers (BBB) and the great variability in BBB permeability depending on the chosen disease. Encouraging results have been obtained demonstrating the possibility of targeting the CNS up to an important percentage of brain localization. In this contest, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and liposomes (LPs) were formulated and specifically engineered to cross the BBB and arrive to CNS and proposed to encapsulate some drugs able to rescue from neurodegeneration, to the CNS. Our attention point on the use of polymeric nanoparticles engineered on surface by a selective ligand able to promote the NPs crossing of BBB.",

Secondly, functional groups on the surface of nanocarriers (polysorbate surfactant layer or covalent binding of apolipoprotein, etc.) can enhance the efficiency of the carrier system in penetrating through the blood-brain barrier. The nanocarrier system is easily phagocytized by mononuclear phagocyte system, and then degraded or metabolized by lysosomes. The chemical groups on the surface of inorganic nanomaterials can be metabolized by enzymes or non-enzymes. Organic nanomaterials may first decompose and then metabolize into smaller particles.

            "text": "Biomedicines 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 15 [52]. The PDI is very important in certain applications, such as cellular uptake [52], targeting specific receptors [53], or crossing biological barriers [54]. A narrow size distribution may be critical to ensure consistent and efficient interactions with biological systems, and hence a positive impact on the clinical effectiveness of the active pharmaceutical ingredient [55]. The size of lipid-based nanocarriers that have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can vary depending on the specific formulation and design of the nanocarrier. However, in general, nanocarriers for drug delivery to the brain are typically designed to be within the nanometer range. This is because the BBB is highly selective and restricts the passage of larger molecules and particles [56]. Smaller molecules, such as nanocarriers with diameters less than 100 nanometers, cross the BBB through a concentration gradient with the assistance of passable transporters, while larger molecules (such as peptides and proteins) may rely on an endocytic mechanism or other active transport mechanisms to facilitate their entry into the brain [57]. Accordingly, the three prepared formulations, NLC1, NLC2, and NLC3, demonstrated sizes of 330.47 \u00b1 22.11, 248.67 \u00b1 12.42, and 1124.21 \u00b1 12.77 nm, respectively, and were expected to cross the BBB through an endocytic mechanism. Additionally, the passage of the PA-loaded lipid-based nanocarrier formulation via a concentration gradient is also possible, since this formulation illustrated a size of 100-160 nm, as shown in the TEM image of Figure 2. Optimization of the formulation and processing parameters and surface modification of the nanocarrier surface will be conducted in our future research. Administration of this nanocarrier via a nasal gel could be another way for brain delivery, as previously described in our research [58]. \n\nA TEM image for our drug-loaded lipid-based nanocarrier formulation is illustrated in Figure 2. The results demonstrate that the studied lipid-based nanocarrier formulation is spherical in shape.",

Moreover, they can avoid phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, thus improving the concentration of drugs in the brain [41]. Several types of nanoparticles have been studied for the efficient blood-brain barrier crossing, including polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nRecent studies have focused on the use of poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid as a material for the synthesis of nanoparticles to encapsulate therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [42] and brain cancer [43,44]. In vitro studies showed that the use of polymeric nanoparticles enhanced drug delivery to the brain, with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and plaque load through the improved delivery of curcumin for treating Alzheimer's disease [42], and efficient internalization of doxorubicin into the human glioma cells, resulting in cytotoxic effect on cancer cells [43]. Additionally, the in vivo experiment regarding the co-delivery of cisplatin and boldine, an antioxidant agent, using the poly(lactide-co-glycolic) nanocarriers resulted in an effective target-specific delivery for therapeutic use in brain cancer therapy [44]. Furthermore, the use of a positively charged polymer, poly(ethylene imine) [45], and of the poly(ethylene imine)-poly(L-lysine) copolymer [46] as gene delivery vehicles has been reported. To improve the cytocompatibility of poly(ethylene imine), L-glutathione was attached to the backbone of the polymer, which also enhanced the passage through the blood-brain barrier in vitro [45]. Thus, it has been demonstrated the potential of poly(ethylene imine)-based nanoparticles for the delivery of genes for gene therapy in brain cancer [45,46].",

            "text": "Non-viral nanoparticles (NPs) have garnered considerable interest in brain drug delivery thanks to their distinctive structures and multifunctional capabilities. For successful crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the physicochemical characteristics of the nanomaterials, such as size, shape, and surface charge, must be carefully tailored. Particle size, in particular, should be given primary consideration. NPs of varying sizes exhibit distinct pharmacokinetics in vivo and tend to accumulate in different organs at different rates. In general, NPs smaller than 5 nm in diameter are considered able to cross the BBB through passive diffusion. However, their short blood circulation time and rapid renal clearance lower their residence time in brain microvessels and therefore their brain delivery. NPs larger than 100 nm undergo rapid clearance by macrophage phagocytosis in the liver and spleen, which also shortens their blood circulation, hinders their penetration across the BBB, and induces organ toxicity concerns [21]. Shape is another key factor affecting the pharmacokinetics and BBB permeability of the NPs owing to their differences in contact quality and contact areas with the target cells in the BBB. It has been reported that the rod-shaped NPs display stronger binding ability toward the BBB endothelium cells than the spherical NPs [22]. The proper length/width aspect ratio is another factor that determines the brain uptake efficiency of NPs. Zeta potential can also have an impact on the BBB-crossing ability of NPs. The positively charged NPs can more easily cross the BBB through the adsorptive-mediated transcytosis relative to the negative or neutral NPs, while they display higher cytotoxicity and tendency to absorb the serum protein in vivo, which results in a faster plasma clearance rate [23]. Based on the above discussions, it is essential to consider the benefit-to-risk ratio and adjust the physiological properties of NPs so they may easily penetrate the BBB with low side effects.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) separates the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation. The barrier characteristics of BBB depend on the properties of the brain endothelial cells that constitute the walls of the blood vessels. There are many neurological diseases such as neurological infections, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and cerebral ischemia, that require a therapy in which the drug must reach the brain. Furthermore, many of these diseases need chronic therapies. Drug targeting to the brain represents a big challenge because many of these drugs do not cross BBB. Therefore, many efforts must be done for the design of strategies to solve this problem. The use of the nose-to-brain delivery route is an important and noninvasive method of drug delivery to bypass the BBB. In fact, it is well-known that there is an intranasal direct anatomical connection between the nasal cavity and the CNS, which suggests the development of nasal formulations for brain targeting of drugs. \n\nDifferent strategies have been developed for nose-to-brain drug delivery, that also involve nanomedicine with different kinds of nanocarriers: polymeric nanoparticles, nano-emulsions, dendrimers, and nano-micelles. These systems can also be bioadhesive. The development of new nasal systems represents a great challenge in the field of controlled drug targeting and delivery. \n\nThis Special Issue was intended to highlight the current progress in the use of the nasal route for brain targeting. A series of research articles and reviews are here present and offer a summary of researches by different groups, making a significant contribution in the field. \n\nThe research section includes five papers. Bonferoni et al. proposed a chitosan salt of chitosan and oleic acid, chitosan oleate, as amphiphilic polymer to obtain polymeric nano-micelles loaded with geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene [1]. Geraniol is abundant in essential oils extracted from aromatic plants and it has anticancer and neuroprotective properties.",

            "text": "Glioma, as the most common tumor of the central nervous system (CNS), is considered a fatal brain disease. According to the World Health Organization criteria, gliomas are classified into four groups: astrocytic tumors, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the highest grade astrocytic tumor and is the most severe and aggressive type of primary brain tumor [1,2]. The median survival time in patients with GBM is approximately 12-15 months, and approximately 5% of patients survive for up to 5 years [3,4]. Surgery is currently the primary treatment for this disease; however, complete surgical resection of GBM is difficult because these tumors are frequently invasive, leading to disease progression or recurrence. Therefore, irradiation and chemotherapy play vital roles in the treatment of GBM [5,6]. Because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-brain-tumor barrier (BBTB), most chemotherapeutic drugs are severely hindered from reaching the GBM region. To date, the efficacy of therapeutic agents through the BBB and BBTB remains a major challenge [7]. \n\nNanocarriers are potential drug delivery systems for CNS therapeutic delivery. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, there has been considerable interest in utilizing nanocarriers to promote therapeutic efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of drugs. Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, nanoparticles (NPs) are believed to preferentially accumulate in tumor regions. Although the brain-targeted delivery of nanomedicines depends on the EPR effect, active brain targeting via receptor-mediated transcytosis has been extensively explored to facilitate the targeted delivery of NPs to cross the BBB and BBTB because of their high specificity [8][9][10]. \n\nHowever, recent reports have indicated only mild improvements in active targeted delivery in the brain. Although NPs have been studied in a large number of preclinical and clinical trials, few NPs have been successfully translated for clinical use [11,12].",

            "text": "Because the brain is the most important human organ, many brain disorders can cause severe symptoms. For example, glioma, one type of brain tumor, is progressive and lethal, while neurodegenerative diseases cause severe disability. Nevertheless, medical treatment for brain diseases remains unsatisfactory, and therefore innovative therapies are desired. However, the development of therapies to treat some cerebral diseases is difficult because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-brain tumor barrier prevents drugs from entering the brain. Hence, drug delivery system (DDS) strategies are required to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, brain-targeted DDS have been developed, which increases the quality of therapy for cerebral disorders. This review gives an overview of recent brain-targeting DDS strategies. First, it describes strategies to cross the BBB. This includes BBB-crossing ligand modification or temporal BBB permeabilization. Strategies to avoid the BBB using local administration are also summarized. Intrabrain drug distribution is a crucial factor that directly determines the therapeutic effect, and thus it is important to evaluate drug distribution using optimal methods. We introduce some methods for evaluating drug distribution in the brain. Finally, applications of brain-targeted DDS for the treatment of brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are explained.",

            "text": "Drug delivery to the brain has remained a significant challenge because of the restriction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is an essential diffusion barrier that protect the normal functions of the brain by impeding the transition of most compounds from the blood to the brain. In contrast, the BBB of patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is disrupted due to the remodeling of protein complexes in inter-endothelial junctions [117]. Drug delivery to the brain mostly depends on the structure and lipophilicity of the molecules. The BBB is impermeable to most macromolecules, with the exception of small molecules that are lipid soluble and have a molecular weight of less than 400 Da [117,118]. Since the population of patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders are increasing, global drug development must grow rapidly [117]. However, the development of CNS drugs has the poorest success rate compared with that of non-CNS drugs. However, a longer development time is required for CNS drugs. A recent study has reported that the development of CNS drugs becomes challenging due to the complexity of the brain, side effects, and the impermeable BBB [107]. Some BBB delivery technologies have been found to allow the entry of drugs into the brain from the blood such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) injection [119]. Nevertheless, CSF injection shows limited drug penetration into the parenchyma of the brain. Zhou et al. stated that nanocarriers have been investigated to find a mechanism that could aid in the delivery of CNS medicines [120]. There are different types of nanocarriers, such as liposomes, ethosomes, SLN, and cubosomes. The use of nanocarriers to deliver CNS drugs may aid in navigating the biological interface and change the treatment of a variety of life-threatening brain illnesses. Cubosomes have a larger lipid compartment ratio in their structure, which permits them to hold large numbers of 'fatty' molecules.",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as clinical depression, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors are among the most destructive and poorly treated diseases (1)(2)(3).Drug development for CNS diseases suffers from long development time and low success rate (3).One major challenge is to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (4)(5)(6)(7)(8).In fact, more than 98% of small-molecule drugs and ~100% of macromolecule drugs failed to cross the BBB (5).To this end, nanomedicine has emerged as a promising method (9)(10)(11).Encapsulation of drugs into functionalized nanocarriers can improve drug bioavailability, realize controlled release, and reduce immune response (12,13).The first nanocarriers that achieved successful drug delivery across the BBB were poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanoparticles through intravenous (IV) injection to mice in 1995 (14).Various aspects of this process have been documented (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22), making PBCA the best-studied model system.After this pioneering study, various nanocarrier systems, including polymer nanoparticles (10,(23)(24)(25)(26)(27), liposomes (28)(29)(30)(31)(32), and albumin-or chitosan-based nanoparticles (33)(34)(35)(36)(37), have been explored.\n\nDespite its rapid progress, nanomedicine has yet to deliver on its promise for treating CNS diseases.Clinically, development of brain-targeted nanomedicine seems to have reached an impasse: there is still no FDA-approved CNS nanomedicine up to now (11).Scientifically, the understanding of nanomedicine for CNS diseases remains primitive.",

            "text": "For larger nanocarriers, the cargo is usually incorporated into the core, and is not covalently attached to the nanoparticle. This allows a progressive controlled release, which is more useful for small drugs. More important is that the nucleic acids are better protected from enzymic degradation. Larger carriers can also incorporate targeting antibodies or peptides on the outside, and/or fluorescent or magnetic trackers, to improve localisation to target cells or imaging. Because of their size, these carriers are generally less able to cross the blood-brain barrier, although there are exceptions. Initially, the formulation of these nanoparticles has followed standard practise intended to optimise transfection of the target cell [53]. For these two reasons, treatment in vivo was usually by intrathecal or intraventricular injection. Subsequent modifications have started to address problems associated with delivery across the blood-brain barrier and distribution within the brain. Larger nanocarriers with oligonucleotide cargoes are typically based on polymers, liposomes, lipids or dendrimers. Exosomes have also been developed, although not yet tested for CNS gene delivery. \n\nPolymer nanocarriers include polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly-(lactic coglycolic acid) PLGA, chitosan and collagen [54]. Polyethyleneimine is a cationic polymer that can form nanoparticles (polyplexes) with DNA, where the positively charged PEI condenses with the negatively charged DNA [55,56]. The polyplexes enter the endosomal pathway and are released into the cell following osmotic swelling of the endosome. PLGA nanoparticles can be synthesised in various sizes [57] and have been optimised for transport across brain endothelial cells [58]. However, they have primarily been used for transport of small therapeutic molecules. Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide that can form complexes with DNA [59]. Although chitosan complexes have relatively low transfection efficiency, they are more readily degraded than other polymer complexes so can release their DNA cargo into the cells quite effectively.",

            "text": "The diseases affecting the brain are numerous, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, head trauma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain cancer, epilepsy, and stroke. The prevalence of these diseases is increasing at an alarming rate. It accounts for 11% of the total world population, which represents over 1.5 billion people globally. The threat worsens as the global burden of CNS disorder is expected to increase to 14.7% by 2020 with the change in population demographics [1]. \n\nThe treatment of brain disorders persists as a daunting challenge amidst the advances in medical technology because of the natural barrier in the brain. The barrier exists at three interfaces namely the blood-brain barrier, which occurs at the blood vessels of the brain, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus, and the blood arachnoid layer of the meninges. These barriers are absolutely a boon to keep the brain and nervous system healthy by strictly prohibiting the entry of any unwanted molecules but a bane when it comes to preventing the therapeutic agents to enter the brain and act in favor of treating the ailment [2]. \n\nNanotechnology offers great promise for revolutionizing medical imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutics [3]. The design and development of innovative nanocarriers made of lipids or polymers as drug delivery systems have been the main input of nanotechnology in pharmaceutics, which helps to carry the drug introduced through various invasive or noninvasive routes in the body in a controlled manner from the site of administration to the therapeutic target [4]. \n\nThe various nanocarriers used for CNS delivery include polymeric nanoparticles, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, nanogels, nanosuspensions, dendrimers, Carbon Nanotubes and fullerenes. Among them, dendrimers owing to their unique characteristics represent a potential therapeutic tool in biomedical and pharmaceutical science. Low dispersity, high functionality, high penetration ability, high density, and peripheral functional group reactivity are some of the featured advantages [5].",

Traditionally, treatment strategies for NDs have included oral and intravenous administration; however, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) can prevent drugs from reaching the brain, rendering the treatment incomplete and the effect unsatisfactory. Additionally, the prolonged or excessive use of drugs that can cross the BBB can damage liver and kidney function. Recent studies have shown that nose-to-brain drug delivery can noninvasively bypass the BBB, allowing drugs to enter the brain through the olfactory or trigeminal nerve pathways; additionally, nanoparticle carriers can enhance drug delivery. This review introduces drug carrier nanoparticles for nose-to-brain delivery systems, compares the advantages and disadvantages of different nanoparticles, and discusses the factors influencing nose-to-brain nanomedicine delivery and enhancement strategies. We also summarize nose-to-brain delivery and nanomedicines for treating NDs, the current challenges of this approach, and the future promise of nanomedicine-based ND treatment.",

Brain consists of natural barriers that pose difficulty for the therapeutic agents to reach the brain tissues. Blood-brain barrier is the major barrier while blood-brain tumor barrier, blood-cerebrospinal (CSF) barrier and efflux pump impart additional hindrance. Therapeutic goal is to achieve a considerable drug concentration in the brain tissues in order to obtain desired therapeutic outcomes. To overcome the barriers, nanotechnology was employed in the field of drug delivery and brain targeting. Nanopharmaceuticals are rapidly emerging sub-branch that deals with the drug-loaded nanocarriers or nanomaterials that have unique physicochemical properties and minute size range for penetrating the CNS. Additionally, nanopharmaceuticals can be tailored with functional modalities to achieve active targeting to the brain tissues. The magic behind their therapeutic success is the reduced amount of dose and lesser toxicity, whereby local-izing the therapeutic agent to the specific site. Different types of nanopharmaceuticals like polymeric, lipidic and amphiphilic nanocarriers were administered into the living organisms by exploiting different routes for improved targeted therapy. Therefore, it is essential to throw light on the properties, mechanism and delivery route of the major nanopharmaceuticals that are employed for the brain-specific drug delivery.",

Currently, by loading a drug that is poorly distributed in the brain into the nanocarrier system, good interactions with the nasal mucosa can be achieved to prolong the residence time and ultimately produce higher drug concentration in the brain parenchyma. Such a nanocarrier can be modified with targeting ligands to preferentially bind to receptors or transporters expressed at the BBB to enhance brain selectivity and permeability [50]. In addition, by crossing the barrier through the process of cell transcytosis, this system can be further used for effective drug delivery [51]. Among them, nanoparticles are one of the most researched drug delivery systems, ranking as the third most frequent keyword. Since nanoparticles can protect encapsulated drugs from degradation, chemicals, and P-gp efflux, proteins are extracellularly delivered, thus improving the nose-to-brain drug delivery [25].",

With the brain as the target tissue, one obstacle that needs to be overcome is the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). BBB protects the CNS from potential neurotoxins, toxic organisms, and chemical substances in the blood, but that also limits its accessibility for many therapeutic drug molecules [27]. \n\nThe use of nanoparticles (NP), with sizes between 10 and 1000 nm, capable of encapsulating therapeutic molecules by targeting transport processes in the CNS, can improve the crossing of molecules through the BBB in neurological disorders and reach targeted brain regions [29][30][31]. Soft NP, such as nanoliposomes (NL) or exosomes, represent one of the most effective drug delivery processes to be able to protect therapeutic agents and deliver them to the target tissues [32,33]. A growing number of studies report a restorative effect of NL on cellular and animal models of neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, AD) [34][35][36], suggesting improved NP-mediated bioavailability in the CNS. \n\nFurthermore, nanotechnology can be used to improve the bioavailability of PUFA in the form of NL [34,37]. NLs are spherical and closed vesicles with diameters in the nanometer range, formed by phospholipid bilayers dispersed in an aqueous medium [38,39]. NL can be designed to contain n-3 PUFA-rich phospholipids with beneficial neuroprotective properties. Moreover, NL can be used to encapsulate a variety of molecules, including hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs, proteins, or DNA [40]. They represent an excellent drug delivery process because of their biofilm characteristics which closely resemble those of cell membranes. In addition, NL forms a protective barrier that protects the molecules from degradation by enzymes in the mouth and stomach, digestive juices, bile acid, and intestinal microorganisms [41,42].",

            "text": "There is extensive work in the field of PEGylated nanocarriers for drug delivery to the brain.Here, we will simply highlight seminal work that, from our perspective, has opened the scope of their functionality.For example, Couvreur and his colleagues pioneered work on the performance of PEGylated polycyanoacrylate nanoparticles in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB).They hypothesized that passive diffusion across the compromised barrier and macrophage exceptions (refer to Table 1 for a non-exclusive list) [32,33].Particularly noteworthy is the emergence of PEGylated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, notably in mRNA vaccines, representing a significant milestone.The clinical success of these vaccines not only underscores the potential of PEGylated nanocarriers but also paves the way for their broader clinical application, especially in mRNA therapeutics.Furthermore, the successful large-scale production, distribution, and administration of billions of doses of PEGylated NPs underscore their potential utility on a global scale.The behavior of intramuscularly injected mRNA vaccines provides valuable insights into the role of PEG in enhancing diffusion.However, a critical area necessitating further investigation concerns the interaction of nanocarriers with proteins and other biological components within the human body.While it has been presumed that PEGylation mitigates such interactions, empirical evidence suggests that factors such as PEG detachment and the affinity of PEGylated nanocarriers for specific proteins require nuanced consideration.Consequently, additional fundamental research is warranted to elucidate optimal strategies for leveraging PEGylated biomaterials to their fullest potential.It is our contention that the forthcoming years will witness the emergence of novel PEGylated nanocarriers, fostering advancements in therapeutic modalities, particularly those centered on biological drugs.Therefore, PEGylation represents a prominent strategy in pharmaceutical technology, offering considerable potential for enhancing the performance of drug nanocarriers within biological systems.Despite its widespread adoption, the translation of PEGylated nanomedicine candidates into clinical applications has encountered certain challenges.",

Similarly, pulmonary delivery is another method that should focus on aerodynamic characteristics of delivery systems and their ability to deliver drugs with improved bioavailability. Non-invasive pulmonary delivery involves extremely large surface area for drug absorption, thin alveolar epithelium, permitting rapid absorption and absence of first-pass metabolism and thus needs special attention for developing nanostructured systems. Especially in case of central nervous system diseases, the targeted delivery capable of crossing blood-brain barrier should be examined more in detail.

            "text": "The other examined approach is focused on enhancing the bioavailability of therapeutics in the brain tissue by facilitating their way through the blood-brain barrier. Those include increasing compounds liposolubility by liposome encapsulation and modulating the blood-brain barrier itself by inhibiting efflux pumps, increasing blood-brain permeability with bradykinin receptors adenosine receptors activation, treating tight junctions physically, for example, with ultrasounds or osmotic agents [53][54][55]. Currently, engineered nanomaterials can encapsulate therapeutic compounds in a shell with programmable size, charge, and surface biochemistry, which allows for exploiting blood-brain barrier transportation pathways [56]. A variety of nanocarriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, or inorganic nanoparticles, have been formulated to overcome BBB and subjected to clinical trials [57]. Also, molecular carriers like cryptands, calixarenes, cyclophanes, spherands, cyclodextrins, and crown ethers, which can form intermolecular interactions with small molecules based on the \"host-guest\" relation, have been investigated as potential devices allowing for effective drug delivery [58]. Those types of supramolecular structures based on cyclodextrin cages, with the proven ability to cross the BBB, could be utilized as potential carriers of new aziridine-hydrazide hydrazone derivatives (ARA12 and ARA13) [59]. Presented compounds have the right substituents and are the appropriate size to form hydrogen bonds and adapt to such molecular carriers. An alternative option is linking the tested compounds to BBB-penetrating peptide shuttles so as to create peptide-drug conjugates able to get through the BBB by using the peptides with BBB-penetrating properties as vectors to deliver small therapeutic molecules to brain parenchyma [60]. This approach will require the use of a suitable ester linker but is still possible. \n\nAdditionally, the carriers can be modified to selectively target tumoral cells in order to minimize the undesired side effects of injuring the non-neoplastic microenvironment.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle drug carriers consist of solid biodegradable particles in size ranging from 10 to 1000 nm (50\u0096300 nm generally). The use of minute particles as drug carriers for targeted treatment has been studied over a long period of time. A selective accumulation of active substances in target tissues has been demonstrated for certain so-called nanocarrier systems that are administered bound to pharmaceutical drugs. Great expectations are placed on nanocarrier systems that can overcome natural barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and transport the medication directly to the desired tissue and thus heal neurological diseases that were formerly incurable. Polymeric Nanoparticle have been shown to be promising carriers for CNS drug delivery due to their potential both in encapsulating drugs, hence protecting them from excretion and metabolism, and in delivering active agents across the blood \u0096 brain barrier without inflicting any damage to the barrier. Different polymers have been used and different strategies like surface modification have been done to increase the retention time of nanoparticles.

            "text": "In addition, the use of appropriate routes of drug delivery, including nasal administration and intrathecal injection, has improved the success rate of crossing the BBB. A Nanoscale brain-targeted drug delivery system is a new type of nano drug delivery system, which can target drugs specifically to diseased tissues, organs, and even cells, with the characteristics of low dosage, high efficacy, and low toxic side effects, and the drug delivery method and speed can be easily controlled. 37 However, for effective brain drug delivery, crossing the blood-brain barrier is only the first step, how the delivery system transports the drug within the brain to its target pathological site should also consider various mechanisms such as CNS solute clearance of nanoparticles, easy aggregation of nanocarriers, for example, liposomes remain confined to the stratum corneum in the skin, 38 and also because of their small size, they will remain in the distal part of the circulatory system and enter the nucleus to cause DNA damage, 39 which will affect the effectiveness and safety of the drug. \n\nTherefore, in this study, the effect of transdermal administration of nanoparticles across the BBB into the CNS was investigated using microneedles as a vehicle, where NPs under 200 nm have a passive targeting effect, facilitating more drugs to be targeted for action in the brain. 40 In addition, the shortcomings of insufficient rigidity of NPs, poor selfdeformability, and poor transfer efficiency due to biological barriers can be solved by combining DMNs with NPs in physical permeation-promoting methods, 41 thus improving the permeation rate of drug transdermal absorption into the body. 42 We used in vivo imaging techniques to dynamically observe the penetration behavior of Rh-NPs-DMNs and analyze the results of microneedle morphological changes in combination with H&E staining of isolated skin, frozen sections, and skin healing, respectively, to evaluate whether microneedle-loaded nanoparticles and/or APIs administered transdermally can achieve adequate exposure in the distal CNS.",

Various drugs are used for its treatment, although no effective therapy has been found yet. The blood brain barrier (BBB) significantly complicates drugs delivery to the target cells in the brain tissues. One of the problem-solving methods is the usage of nanocontainer systems. In this review we summarized the data about nanoparticles drug delivery systems and their application for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Firstly, we described and characterized types of nanocarriers: inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric and lipid nanocarriers, their advantages and disadvantages. We discussed ways to interact with nerve tissue and methods of BBB penetration. We provided a summary of nanotechnology-based pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, where development of nanocontainer drugs derives the most active. We described various experimental drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease that include vector nanocontainers targeted on \u03b2-amyloid or tau-protein. Integrally, nanoparticles can substantially improve the drug delivery as its implication can increase BBB permeability, the pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of applied drugs. Thus, nanotechnology is anticipated to overcome the limitations of existing pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders and to effectively combine various treatment modalities in that direction.",

            "text": "A TEM image for our drug-loaded lipid-based nanocarrier formulation is illustrated in Figure 2. The results demonstrate that the studied lipid-based nanocarrier formulation is spherical in shape. The formulation exhibits a size that is lower than that obtained using DLS, an effect that may be attributed to sample dilution and proper dispersion prior to the sample being mounted on the grid, which prevent particle agglomeration [59]. The size of lipid-based nanocarriers that have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can vary depending on the specific formulation and design of the nanocarrier. However, in general, nanocarriers for drug delivery to the brain are typically designed to be within the nanometer range. This is because the BBB is highly selective and restricts the passage of larger molecules and particles [56]. Smaller molecules, such as nanocarriers with diameters less than 100 nanometers, cross the BBB through a concentration gradient with the assistance of passable transporters, while larger molecules (such as peptides and proteins) may rely on an endocytic mechanism or other active transport mechanisms to facilitate their entry into the brain [57]. Accordingly, the three prepared formulations, NLC1, NLC2, and NLC3, demonstrated sizes of 330.47 \u00b1 22.11, 248.67 \u00b1 12.42, and 1124.21 \u00b1 12.77 nm, respectively, and were expected to cross the BBB through an endocytic mechanism. Additionally, the passage of the PA-loaded lipid-based nanocarrier formulation via a concentration gradient is also possible, since this formulation illustrated a size of 100-160 nm, as shown in the TEM image of Figure 2. Optimization of the formulation and processing parameters and surface modification of the nanocarrier surface will be conducted in our future research. Administration of this nanocarrier via a nasal gel could be another way for brain delivery, as previously described in our research [58].",

            "text": "Unfortunately, nowadays, brain disorders, which include both neurological and mental disorders, are the main cause of years spent living with a disability worldwide. There are serious diseases with a high prevalence and a high mortality rate. However, the outmoded technical infrastructure makes their treatment difficult. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a protective mechanism for the central nervous system (CNS) and regulates its homeostatic processes. The brain is protected against injury and illness by an extremely complex system that precisely regulates the flow of ions, very few tiny molecules, and an even smaller number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain. Nevertheless, the BBB also considerably inhibits the delivery of medications to the brain, making it impossible to treat a variety of neurological diseases. Several strategies are now being studied to enhance the transport of drugs over the BBB. According to this research, nanoparticles are one of the most promising agents for brain disease treatment while many conventional drugs are also capable of crossing this barrier but there are amazing facts about nanoparticles in brain drug delivery. For example, 1. Precision Targeting: Through mechanisms such as receptor-mediated transport, ligand attachment, or the use of external stimuli (e.g., magnetic or thermal guidance), nanoparticles can deliver drugs specifically to diseased areas of the brain while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues. This targeted approach reduces side effects and enhances therapeutic outcomes. 2. Improved Drug Stability: Drugs can be encapsulated by nanoparticles, which keeps them stable and shields them from deterioration while being transported to the brain. 3. Therapeutic Payload: Nanoparticles possess a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, enabling them to encapsulate a substantial quantity of therapeutic agents relative to their size. This allows for enhanced drug delivery efficiency, maximizing therapeutic outcomes while potentially reducing the required dosage to achieve the desired effect. 4. Imaging Properties: Certain nanoparticles can also act as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for the real-time visualization of drug distribution and administration in the brain. 5. Combination Therapy Possibility: Nanoparticles can be designed to co-deliver multiple medications or therapeutic agents, which could enhance synergistic effects. There have been in vivo studies where nanoparticles",

            "text": "Several drug delivery researchers and formulators have attempted the nose-to-brain drug delivery as it offers several merits and advantages. The ease of administration, noninvasiveness, proximity to the target organ (the brain), and many other benefits such as the circumvention of one of the hardest barriers for drugs to penetrate, viz. the blood-brain barrier, together with the first-pass effect (liver metabolism) avoidance [1,2] are among the most important pros of this route of administration. The last two aforementioned advantages specifically lead to a remarkable increase in the drug brain bioavailability compared with other conventional pathways of drug administration such as the oral and intravenous routes [3]. \n\nTo enhance drug absorption and permeability through the nasal mucosa and bloodbrain barrier, several attempts have been adopted. Among these attempts are the use of permeation enhancers and drug nanocarriers. The correct selection of the nanoparticulate materials can provide a very successful means of delivering the drug molecule to the brain via the nose. Exploiting the trigeminal and olfactory nerves for the nose-to-brain delivery warrants the usage of several hydrophobic or amphiphilic nanosystems such as the solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid nanocapsules, liposomes, microemulsions, PLGA, Pullulan and chitosan polymeric nanoparticles, and gelatin as protein nanocarriers [4][5][6]. \n\nFurthermore, the controlled manner of delivery of drugs currently poses a subject of high significance at both the industrial and academic levels due to its great benefits in the therapy of serious diseases [7][8][9][10]. In a previous and recent meta-analysis study, lipid-based nanosystems were proven to be more capable of increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs after the comparison with conventional systems and formulations [11]. More recently, the use of polymeric nanoparticles was also proven to significantly increase the bioavailability of the aforementioned drugs despite its different nature and chemical structure [12].

            "text": "The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a complex physiological checkpoint that restricts the free diffusion of circulating molecules from the blood into the central nervous system. Delivering of drugs and other active agents across the BBB is one of the major technical challenges faced by scientists and medical practitioners. Therefore, development of novel methodologies to address this challenge holds the key for both the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases, such as HIV-associated encephalopathy. Bioconjugated quantum dots (QDs) are excellent fluorescent probes and nano-vectors, being designed to transverse across the BBB and visualize drug delivery inside the brain. This paper discusses the use of functionalized QDs for crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier and treating brain disease. We highlight the guidelines for using in vitro BBB models for brain disease studies. The theranostic QDs offers a strategy to significantly improve the effective dosages of drugs to transverse across the BBB and orientate to the targets inside the brain.",

            "text": "Controlling or manipulating substances or objects that are created on a nanometer (one billionth of a meter) scale is referred to as \"nanotechnology.\" The multifunctional and adaptable architectures of Nanoparticles (NPs) make them suitable for delivery of nanodrugs such as macugen and somavert to the brain. Before they can be used, though, a number of factors must be taken into account, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, shape, size, and charge, to name a few. One of the biggest obstacles in CNS-targeted therapies is crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems are crucial in addressing this issue. The BBB acts as an obstacle that keeps out various propagated molecules, along with deadly ones, so that only the right ratio of nutrients passes through instead of harmful/foreign substances. It is possible to create drug delivery systems using nanotechnology that interact with specific cellular subsets or molecules, providing more targeted treatment. With these systems, it is also possible to simultaneously achieve multifunctional qualities like bioactivity, targeting, imaging capabilities, and gene delivery. In this regard, the use of drug delivery methods based on nanotechnology for diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative purposes has been widely adopted. Numerous studies have been conducted on nanosystems with various biological characteristics and combinations for applications in gene and drug delivery. 10 oth invasive and noninvasive methods are available for increasing BBB permeability, including intraventricular or intracerebral injections or implantation, infusion, and intranasal administration using drug modification. In some situations, disruption may also work well for crossing of the BBB. The BBB is frequently ruptured to increase the effectiveness of drug delivery to the brain. The physical and chemical properties of NPs determine their path and the methods by which they can cross the BBB. Designing and creating nanoparticles that specifically target the appropriate fraction of affected neurons without damaging other healthy neurons can be tricky. This is crucial, particularly when harmful medications are used to treat aggressive brain tumors. 11",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP)-based medicines involve the use of nanoscale materials, and they can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases [1,2]. The majority of NPs have focused on the use of particles as a delivery vector for drugs, as well as mRNA sequences for vaccine therapy [3]. Multiple materials have been utilized for this delivery method; liposomes involve the use of a lipid membrane to encapsulate the therapeutic for delivery, and more recently liposomes have been altered to be able to increase circulation time by creating stealth vesicles [4,5]. Polyethylene glycol can increase the circulation time of the particle, and this is beneficial for several reasons as increased retention can increase the chance of uptake of the particle into tumor cells [4][5][6]. Although liposomes have many advantages, there are distinct disadvantages, as liposomes require special storage conditions as well as being prone to oxidative damage [7,8]. \n\nNanocarriers are also capable of delivery of drugs to areas of the body that are protected and can restrict the ability to deliver drugs to the target, such as the blood-brain barrier [9]. The blood-brain barrier is a semipermeable membrane that regulates the movement of ions and molecules, to cross into the central nervous system (CNS). This barrier can also restrict drugs from crossing into the CNS, making diseases that target the brain difficult to treat [10]. Nanocarriers can help to overcome the difficulties of delivering therapies to the brain, and niosomes are a class of NP that are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier. Niosomes can be single and multilamellar composed of lipids and nonionic surfactants that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs for delivery [9]. These NPs are generally hollow spherical particles that can be used as carriers for a therapeutic payload [11]. A further class of NP are iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) and these are naturally occurring as well as synthetically produced.",

Although many nanomaterials have gained FDA approval or entered clinical trials, the clinical usage of nanomaterial-based brain drug delivery systems remains restricted. The primary reasons include: (1) further investigation is required for in vitro and in vivo models for BBB crossing [35]; (2) nanomaterial safety and side effects necessitate additional study [35]; (3) nanocarrier properties, such as surface properties, particle size, loading agents, and host materials, still necessitate further assessment for their BBB crossing impact [35]; (4) brain-targeted delivery efficiency is inadequate, and after intravenous administration, it is quickly phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to inadequate brain drug treatment concentrations and ineffective treatment outcomes [36]; and (5) nanocarrier degradation and biocompatibility challenges [36]. To address these challenges, it is worth exploring in-depth how functional modification can reduce nanocarrier toxicity while achieving rapid in vivo degradation while still maintaining a high therapeutic concentration at the target site. This is an area that requires further investigation in brain-targeted nano drug delivery systems. Despite less than 30 years of research, the development of NDDS that can cross the BBB has demonstrated substantial potential. In the future, more resources and expertise will certainly be invested in this field of research, and NDDS for crossing the BBB will continue to evolve towards stronger targeting, higher safety, and better efficacy.",

            "text": "The emergence of nanomedicine has profoundly impacted the field of precision medicine [2,42]. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems facilitate the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues, thereby improving drug bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [2]. Numerous types of nanocarriers have been developed for drug delivery, including polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and lipid-based nanoparticles [18]. Recent advancements in nanotechnology are focused on overcoming four major biological barriers: pulmonary mucus, gastrointestinal mucus, the placental barrier, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Fig. 1) [12]. Nanocarriers are proficient at surmounting these biological obstacles, thereby enabling efficient drug delivery to targeted sites, which is essential for achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes [1,43]. For example, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier to deliver drugs directly to brain tissue, providing promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease [44]. \n\nNanocarriers exhibit significant potential in drug development, cancer therapy, gene therapy, diagnostic imaging, and vaccine development, thus becoming a central focus of biomedical research [45][46][47]. The nanocarriers composed of alginate and chitosan, demonstrate superior biocompatibility and biodegradability [48]. They are especially effective in delivering anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine [48]. Solid lipid nanocarriers and nanostructured lipid carriers improve therapeutic delivery in skin cancer treatments, enhancing systemic bioavailability and site-specific targeting [43]. Additionally, Zhao et al. proposed a smart spatiotemporal drug release system utilizing multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy of melanoma, which significantly improved tumor imaging and photothermal treatment efficacy in vivo [49]. Furthermore, nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems possess substantial potential in gene therapy [2,50,51].",

Additionally, strategies have been explored to synthesize liposomes that respond to internal and/or external stimuli to release their payload controllably. Although research into liposomes for brain cancer treatment is still in its infancy, these systems have great potential to fundamentally change the drug delivery landscape. This review paper attempts to consolidate relevant literature regarding the delivery to the brain using nanocarriers, particularly liposomes. The paper first briefly explains conventional treatment modalities for cancer, followed by describing the blood\u2013brain barrier and ways, challenges, and techniques involved in transporting drugs across the BBB. Various nanocarrier systems are introduced, with attention to liposomes, due to their ability to circumvent the challenges imposed by the BBB. Relevant studies involving liposomal systems researched to treat brain tumors are reviewed in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Finally, the challenges associated with the use of liposomes to treat brain tumors and how they can be addressed are presented.",

Among them, modifications of conventional drugs have stimulated the recent development of nanotechnology platforms for crossing the BBB to enable drug delivery to the CNS [10]. With the goal of improving blood to brain transport, nanoplatforms have incorporated modifications such as cationization in order to trigger the AMT process, modifications with small nutrients such as amino acids, hexoses, or vitamins to activate CMT, or the incorporation of endogenous large molecules such as transferrin, lactoferrin, neuropeptides, lectins, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor to activate RMT. Although the pore size in the BBB allowing a passive diffusion is usually less than one nanometer, nanoparticles that have a diameter of several nanometers can cross the BBB by means of CMT [53]. \n\nVarious types of nanoparticles (NPs) (liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid NPs, micelles, dendrimers) have been examined as drug delivery systems (DDS) for enhancing the efficacy of agents administered to the brain. As a result, there is a now a rich body of literature available concerning recent developments in promising nanotechnological approaches concerning AD [54,55]. Despite the recent European rejection of the drug aducanumab, due to its harmful side effects, the first clinical success of this monoclonal antibody, which removes amyloid plaques in the brain and slows the progression of the disease, paved the way for the development of strategies using dendrimers both as DDS and as drugs per se [53]. \n\nDendrimers are NPs of small size which represent promising candidates for noninvasive approaches and for systemic drug administration and delivery to the brain. Their special characteristics not only enable them to be modified in order to be transported through biological barriers, including the BBB, but also allow them to play a dual role as therapeutic agents and nanocarriers.",

[58], SLNs were formulated and successfully employed as a nanocarrier for FA.SLNs were prepared via a warm oil-in-water microemulsion by using Compritol 888 ATO under mechanical stirring, and FA-loaded SLNs were obtained by dissolving FA in the melted lipid matrix.The resultant nanocomplex possesses a small colloidal surface with a highly negative surface charge when dispersed in water.",

            "text": "The development of suitable drug carriers is important for improving the therapeutic efficiency of biomedical applications. Recent advances in the field of nanotechnology have paved the way for the preparation of multiple drug carriers. The treatment of ischemic stroke is not very effective due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which results in little penetration of the drug into the brain. Therefore, formulated nanoparticles should have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Lu et al. (2021) synthesized l-myostatin (LMNP) complex PLGA-functionalized magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles (MNP) loaded with dexamethasone (dm@LMNP), which were shown to be an effective drug delivery platform that could cross the blood-brain barrier to treat ischemic stroke. Experimental results have shown that nano preparations loaded with lmyostatin have greatly facilitated the passage of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (Lu et al., 2021). Furthermore, Jeong et al. (2019) synthesized a new EPO delivery system, namely bile acid-coated poly (lactic acid-hydroxy acetic acid; PLGA) nanoparticles loaded with EPO (EPO-CA-NPs), with the aim of making EPO-CA-NPs effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier. EPO-CA-NPs on animal models of stroke revealed that the newly synthesized brain-targeted EPO delivery system, by enabling EPO to enter the brain more efficiently, was more effective than EPO alone in stroke treatment (Jeong et al., 2019). In the treatment of cerebral infarction, Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has a pro-angiogenic and neuroprotective effect. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the entry of Rg1 into brain tissue. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is overexpressed in the blood-brain barrier. Shen et al. (2019) prepared a TfR-targeted nanocarrier (PATRC) to penetrate the blood-brain barrier for the treatment of cerebral infarction.",

            "text": "Neurodegenerative diseases are common, incurable neurological disorders with high prevalence, and lead to memory, movement, language, and intelligence impairments, threatening the lives and health of patients worldwide. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), a physiological barrier between the central nervous system and peripheral blood circulation, plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of the intracerebral environment by strictly regulating the transport of substances between the blood and brain. Therefore, it is difficult for therapeutic drugs to penetrate the BBB and reach the brain, and this affects their efficacy. Nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as drug transport carriers and are also known as nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDDSs). These systems not only increase the stability of drugs but also facilitate the crossing of drugs through the BBB and improve their efficacy. In this article, we provided an overview of the types and administration routes of NPs, highlighted the preclinical and clinical studies of NDDSs in neurodegenerative diseases, and summarized the combined therapeutic strategies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the prospects and challenges of NDDSs in recent basic and clinical research were also discussed. Above all, NDDSs provide an inspiring therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "BBB is a natural barrier protecting the brain from the entrance of toxins and pathogens. However, intact BBB consisted of endothelial cells and tight junctions impedes the brain permeability of therapeutic agents, which largely comprises their therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases. Along with the rapid development of materials science and nanotechnology, various strategies for BBB regulation and crossing have been developed and engineered delivery systems with unique physio-chemical properties and multifunctional motifs were prepared for enhanced drug delivery via different BBB crossing pathways. This review introduced the basic information of BBB structure and physiology and discussed the different strategies to enhance BBB crossing in detail as well as the bypassing routes and mechanisms. Recent progress of various types of drug delivery systems and their distinguishing attributes for BBB crossing were summarized. The engineered drug delivery systems with appropriate physio-chemical properties, multifunctional modules, and good biocompatibility guaranteed excellent performance of BBB penetration for enhanced drug delivery. \n\nAlthough extensive achievements have been made in this community with several FDA-approved trials, there is still a long way to go from clinical popularization and translational application. More efforts on both development of materials engineering and biomedicine are needed to bridge the gap. We list some pointel aspects for future research as following: (1) More appropriate in vitro and in vivo models for evaluation of BBB permeability. Currently, cell monolayer model (e.g., Transwell model) was widely used to verify the BBB crossing and calculate the penetration efficiency. Yet, a compliant three-dimensional BBB model is more preferred to investigate the role of blood flow transport in BBB maintenance. Recent advances in 3D printing technology may provide an alternative approach to in vitro BBB study; 377,378 (2) Targeted delivery with better spatial and temporal precision. Although abovementioned strategies provide means to improve brain targeting, none of them could complete brain region-specific delivery, which is crucial for treatment of brain disorders. Strategy of targeting ligand functionalization significantly relies on the receptor expression, and stimuli-triggered BBB disruption has limited resolution. Drug release in a time-controlled manner would also be highly favored. Treatment of paroxysmal disorders such as epilepsy required timely drug release. (3) Safety issues should be addressed clinical translation.",

            "text": "Current therapeutic vectors have physicochemical characteristics that limit their ability to pass through cellular barriers to reach the brain. To improve the brain bioavailability of therapeutic drugs, new formulations based on nanocarriers emerge. A well-designed nanocarrier system must meet several requirements, including high stability and specificity, proper tissue distribution, effective cell penetration and efficient cytoplasmic or nuclear delivery [143]. The physicochemical properties of nanocarriers including size, shape, surface charge, porosity and crystalline arrangement determine their physiological behavior. As broad types of nanoparticles (NPs) made of biological and/or synthetic materials are available, selecting suitable particles relies mainly on the type of therapeutic molecule to be transported. \n\nAlthough viral vectors exhibited high transfection efficiency, their mutagenic/oncogenic potential, as well as their limited drug loading capacity and high-cost production, has dis-couraged their use [143,144]. Conversely, NPs constitute a suitable carrier system because they show high biocompatibility and evoke virtually no immune response. Moreover, NPs provide cargoes protection against chemical and biological degradation, and their synthesis is comparatively cheaper than that of viral vectors. Additional advantages of NPs include their ability to penetrate deep tissues, tiny capillaries and cell membranes [144,145]. \n\nNP-based carrier systems designed for the brain delivery of therapeutic drugs and molecular tools are composed of different materials, including polymers (nanocapsule, nanosphere, polyplex and nanogel), lipids (solid lipid nanoparticle, nanoliposome, lipoplex and polymersome), metals (magnetic nanoparticle, gold nanoparticle and silica nanoparticle) or a combination of two of the above-mentioned materials (Figure 4). In addition, nanoparticle formulation must provide high biocompatibility, biodegradability, no toxicity and a low level of protein-mediated opsonization [145,146]. In addition, the undesired action of NPs on platelet activation and their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system are some obstacles for NPs to overcome [145,146].",

            "text": "Although nano-particle drugs specifically targeting brain metastases are still in the preclinical research stage, relevant studies have already achieved positive progress. For instance, The HER3 ligand-mimicking nanobioparticles designed by the team led by Lali K. Medina-Kauwe [122] have demonstrated outstanding advantages in preclinical studies. The team utilized organoid chips derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to mimic the humanized blood-brain barrier, conducting in-depth research on the penetration mechanism of the nanobioparticles. The research indicates that these particles can accurately recognize and bind to the HER3 re-ceptors on the surfaces of both the blood-brain barrier and brain tumor cells. With their unique structures and surface modifications, they can efficiently penetrate the blood-brain barrier and specifically accumulate in brain tumors. This achievement has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent initiation of clinical trials. It is expected that these nanobioparticles will enter the clinical treatment stage in the near future, bringing new treatment options for patients with brain tumors. In addition, another study has developed a P-selectin-targeted nanocarrier [123]. This nanocarrier can specifically bind to P-selectin on the surface of endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, inducing a caveolin-1-dependent transcytosis, thereby achieving active crossing of the blood-brain barrier. This mechanism provides a new pathway for the delivery of drugs to the brain, and it is expected to solve the problem that traditional drugs have difficulty effectively penetrating the blood-brain barrier. It offers new drug delivery strategies and research directions for the treatment of brain diseases, such as brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, and has potential application value in the clinical treatment of brain diseases. These studies all highlight the enormous potential of nanodrugs in the treatment of brain metastases. With the deepening of research, nanoparticles are expected to bring about new changes in the treatment of brain tumors and improve the prognosis of patients.",

            "text": "The polyelectrolyte microcapsules fabricated by the LbL-technique have been demonstrated as an efficient delivery system for targeting different tissue and cell types. The suitability for this type of carriers has been confirmed in animals in vivo through either systemic application [44][45][46][47] or during local injections of the microcapsule suspension into the targeted tissue [24]. However, there have been only a few attempts to explore the use of biodegradable LbL-microcapsules in the central nervous system, especially with respect to the brain where multiple and distinct cell types are densely inter-connected with high spatial specificity. Therefore, our aim was to examine the potential of LbL-microcapsules for localised delivery of neurotrophins to central neurons, a potential tool to enhance guidance and formation of functional neuronal connections. This context differs from that of systemic application which envisages blood-brain barrier permeability followed by cell targeting.\n\nOur strategy took advantage of the previous work in which fabrication protocols, release properties, and biodegradation in situ and in vivo for the LbL-fabricated microcapsules have been established [12,23,24,33]. Thus, the functional data obtained here in neuronal-astrocyte co-cultures, together with the previous reports pertaining to the encapsulation per se, suggest that LbL microcapsules meet the key requirements for applications targeting brain neurons. These include (i) high biocompatibility (no excitotoxicity) for all constitutive components of the microcapsule, (ii) gradual, prolonged release of the encapsulated compound of interest (including low molecular weight substances), and (iii) biodegradability (safe use). Monitoring primary hippocampal neurons in the present work has revealed no signs of excitotoxicity in the presence of microcapsules, at any stage of neuronal development and morphogenesis in vitro. Again, this is consistent with no effects of empty LbL-microcapsules (of the same composition) on primary hippocampal neurons or on peripheral nerve cells in vivo [24]. In addition, numerous studies have reported no toxicity produced by the Lb",

In this Perspective, we present how pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), formulation and nanotoxicity factors impact the therapeutic success of brain-specific nanodelivery. Properties including high loading efficiency, slow in vivo drug release, long systemic circulation, an increase in unbound brain-to-plasma concentration/exposure ratio (Kp,uu,brain), high drug potency, and minimal nanotoxicity are prerequisites that should preferably be combined to maximize the therapeutic potential of a brain-targeted NC. The PK of brain-directed NCs needs to be evaluated in a more therapeutically relevant manner, focusing on the released, unbound drug. It is more crucial to increase the Kp,uu,brain than to improve the ability of the NC to cross the BBB in its intact form. Brain-targeted NCs, which are mostly developed for treating brain tumors, including metastases, should aim to enhance drug delivery not just to tumor regions with disrupted BBB, but equally important to regions with intact BBB where the drugs themselves have problems reaching. This article provides critical insights into how a brain-targeted nanoformulation needs to be designed and optimized to achieve therapeutic success in the brain.",

Antioxidant enzymes can lower reactive oxygen species (ROS), but because of their transient presence in the blood and subsequent decomposition, they have a hard time crossing the blood-brain barrier [28]. Polymer nanoparticles are the most common type of medication delivery technology because they can cross cells' tight connections. Additionally, they have a high drug-loading capacity and boost the efficiency of medications taken in combination. In this aspect, nanocapsules are crucial to current drug delivery because they can preserve the medication and have a high drug-loading capacity, increasing the likelihood that the drug will reach the brain. Additionally, the reticuloendothelial system's macrophages are protected from drug detection by these nanoparticles [29].",

            "text": "The drug delivery system (DDS) can comprehensively regulate the distribution of drugs in the organism in space, time, and dose. It has multiple roles: (i) drug targeting; (ii) slow and controlled drug release; (iii) enhancing drug stability and regulating drug metabolism time; (iv) promoting drug absorption and passage through biological barriers. Modern drug delivery technology started with the advent of extended-release capsule technology in 1952, followed by oral and transdermal formulations, long-acting injectables, pegylated liposomes, drug-polymer complexes, antibody-drug conjugates, and nano-delivery systems over 70 years [1]. \n\nDelivery of drugs to the CNS has been a challenging subject to overcome. In the brain, the main biological barrier is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Various pathways have been developed to overcome the poor penetration of the BBB [2-6]. However, so far, it remains a bottleneck in CNS drug development [7]. To overcome the BBB, lots of drug delivery systems have been developed, such as adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors [8], erythrocyte membrane-encapsulated nanocarriers [9], cell-based delivery nanocarriers [10], extracellular vesicles (EVs) [11], injectable hydrogels [12], and immunomodulators [13]. Among them, EVs performed surprisingly well. \n\nEVs are small membranous vesicles released into the extracellular matrix by almost all cells and are widely present in various body fluids [14]. It was initially thought that EVs were cell-secreted garbage bags as a cellular self-cleaning mechanism. Nevertheless, as research progressed, EVs were found to stably carry important signaling molecules such as proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and lipids, which have important roles in intercellular communication [15,16], disease diagnosis [17][18][19], disease development [20,21], and disease therapy [22,23].",

The BBB is essential to maintain the microenvironment necessary for a suitable neuronal function. To this aim, the BBB is formed by the microvascular endothelium of the brain whose functions, together with some cells such as astrocytes, generate a barrier that separates circulating blood from brain nervous tissue [40].\n\nThe improvement of drug delivery to the brain through SLNs is based in the ability of these nanoparticles to stabilize molecules and to increase their bioavailability and permeability. In treatments targeting the central nervous system, the stability of a compound in plasma is essential to maintain an acceptable concentration in order to achieve the desired pharmacological effect. SLNs improve drug bioavailability, allowing the dose that reaches the brain to be higher in comparison to the administration of the free drug. SLNs can also act as vehicles that interact with the barrier, therefore favoring the penetration of drugs that initially could not cross it [41].\n\nAlthough SLNs enhance drug delivery through the BBB, other strategies based on these nanoparticles could bypass this barrier. This could be achieved by drug administration via nasal or intranasal route, exploiting a nose-to-brain drug delivery path. Nasal administration is a simple method, which would not cause as much disturbs on patients as, for instance, the parenteral route. The optimum nose-to-brain transport occurs through the olfactory epithelium, reaching the olfactory bulb and then the central nervous system [42], and there is evidence reporting that SLNs properly carry out this transport [43].\n\nFinally, there are also barriers against the systemic use of SLNs themselves. For instance, the reticuloendothelial system represents a significant limitation for nanocarriers, since it implies their elimination from blood circulation. The mechanism consists of coating the nanoparticles by plasma components such as albumin or immunoglobulin G, leading to their fast elimination",

            "text": "But these large neurotrophic protein molecules do not efficiently cross the blood-barrier into the CNS [42,43]. BBB restricts the transport of most small hydrophilic molecules and macromolecules from the cerebrovascular circulation into the brain, due to the distinct morphology and enzymatic properties of endothelial cells that enable them to form complex tight junctions with minimal endocytic activity [11,44,45]. Several approaches are being pursued to deliver drugs across BBB which include, the use of lipid carrier, tagging drugs to ligands that cross the BBB through a carrier mediated transport (CMT) or receptor mediated transport (e.g. insulin, transferrin, etc) [21]. Some in-vivo strategies for delivering neurotrophic factors to the CNS include direct injection into the brain, viral vector upregulation, [46,47], infusion pump-mediated delivery methods [48], trans-nasal drug delivery, transient disruption of BBB using hyperosomotic solutions and lipidization of small molecules. Unfortunately, these methods presently lack practical relevance for patient treatment and the transport of drugs across BBB still remains a challenge. Clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic deliveries at doses that are sufficiently high to result in therapeutic levels within the CNS parenchyma also result in significant systemic side-effects [49]. In order to solve the drug delivery problems and to comprehend the clinical promise of different neuroprotective factors, new innovative technologies or need for alternative methods of drug delivery are required. This is where nanotechnology comes into play. A significant research exploring nanocarrier drug delivery systems for crossing the BBB has focused on the delivery of anticancer drugs to brain tumors [50]. More recently, the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) has attracted significant importance in biomedical applications and this has been reported by us and others [51,52,53]. MNPs have gained significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic properties, which enable tracking through the radiology cornerstone, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Several in-vitro and in-vivo studies have been reported with magnetically guided drug targeting systems [54,55].",

            "text": "Abstract The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders always remains a challenge for the researchers. The presence of various physiological barriers, primarily the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) limits the accessibility of the brain and hinders the efficacy of various drug therapies. Hence, drug targeting to the brain, particularly to the diseased cells by circumventing the physiological barriers is essential to develop a promising therapy for the treatment of brain disorders. Presently, the investigations emphasize the role of different nanocarrier systems or surface modified target specific novel carrier system to improve the efficiency and reduce the side effects of the brain therapeutics. Such approaches supposed to circumvent the BBB or have the ability to cross the barrier function and thus increases the drug concentration in the brain. Although the efficacy of novel carrier system depends upon various physiological factors like active efflux transport, protein corona of the brain, stability, and toxicity of the nanocarrier, physicochemical properties, patient-related factors and many more. Hence, to develop a promising carrier system, it is essential to understand the physiology of the brain and BBB and also the other associated factors. Along with this, some alternative route like direct nose-to-brain drug delivery can also offer a better means to access the brain without exposure of the BBB. In this review, we have discussed the role of various physiological barriers including the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) on the drug therapy and the mechanism of drug transport across the BBB. Further, we discussed different novel strategies for brain targeting of drug including, polymeric nanoparticles, lipidic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomes, nanogels, nanoemulsions, dendrimers, quantum dots, etc. along with the intranasal drug delivery to the brain. We have also illustrated various factors affecting the drug targeting efficiency of the developed novel carrier system.",

            "text": "In the cell-mediated transcytosis pathway, positively charged nanoparticles can adsorb onto negatively charged regions of the BBB cell membrane via electrostatic interactions, leading to non-specific internalization and transcytosis into the brain tissue (Cogill et al., 2024). In cell-mediated transcytosis, drugs or nanoparticles are first engulfed or encapsulated by cells capable of crossing the BBB (e.g., monocytes, immune cells), and then enter the brain tissue by exploiting the migratory ability and interactions of these cells with the BBB endothelial cells (Zha et al., 2024). Integrating multiple BBB transport strategies is an important direction for research in brain drug delivery using nanoparticles, aiming to further enhance the efficiency and targeting of nanoparticles to the brain. For instance, studies have shown that by preparing albumin/poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) composite nanoparticle systems, leveraging the receptormediated transcytosis mechanism of albumin, optimizing the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and employing adsorptive transcytosis/lipid diffusion pathways, nanoparticles can effectively bypass the BBB and deliver drugs to specific brain regions (Monge-Fuentes et al., 2021a;Monge-Fuentes et al., 2021b). \n\nCompared to traditional drug administration modes, this emerging technology platform has unique advantages that lie in the highly customizable size, surface charge, and targeting moieties of nanocarriers, allowing precise control over drug absorption, distribution, bio-targeting, and excretion processes in the body (Majumder et al., 2019). Furthermore, nanocarriers have been proven to enhance the solubility of drugs with low solubility by dissolving them in hydrophobic or hydrophilic compartments, reducing drug loss during transport and decreasing toxicity (Begines et al., 2020;Li et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Many therapeutic agents are unable to cross this barrier, limiting their effectiveness in treating brain-related conditions. This obstacle has spurred the development of innovative strategies to overcome the BBB, with nanoparticle-based delivery systems emerging as a promising approach. Nanoparticles offer a unique solution to the challenge of drug delivery across the BBB. As shown in Scheme 2, these tiny particles can be designed to interact with the BBB in various ways, such as paracellular transport, carrier-mediated transport, and cell-mediated transport, enabling them to transport therapeutic agents into the brain. Some nanoparticles utilize adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, where their positive charge interacts with the negatively charged cell membrane of brain endothelial cells, facilitating uptake and transport. Additionally, others employ receptor-mediated transcytosis, using specific ligands to bind to receptors on the BBB and trigger internalization. The use of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery offers several advantages over traditional methods. These include improved drug stability, targeted delivery to specific brain regions or cell types, and enhanced BBB penetration [53][54][55][56]. \n\nMOFs have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB in treating brain disorders. This interest is due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high drug loading efficiency, controlled drug release, nanoscale size, ease of surface modification, stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility with low systemic toxicity. A key advantage of MOFs in crossing the BBB is their ability to be functionalized with various ligands and molecules that can target specific receptors on the BBB. This receptor-mediated transport mechanism improves the ability of MOFs to penetrate the BBB and deliver therapeutic agents directly to brain tissues. Additionally, modifying the surface of MOFs can enhance their biocompatibility, stability, and targeting capabilities, further increasing their potential as drug delivery systems [57,58]. \n\nNanomaterials 2024, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW traditional methods.

            "text": "Nanotechnology has aided in the advancement of drug delivery for the treatment of several neurological disorders including depression. Depression is a relatively common mental disorder which is characterized by a severe imbalance of neurotransmitters. Several current therapeutic regimens against depression display drawbacks which include low bioavailability, delayed therapeutic outcome, undesirable side effects and drug toxicity due to high doses. The blood\u2013brain barrier limits the entry of the drugs into the brain matrix, resulting in low bioavailability and tissue damage due to drug accumulation. Due to their size and physico-chemical properties, nanotechnological drug delivery systems present a promising strategy to enhance the delivery of nanomedicines into the brain matrix, thereby improving bioavailability and limiting toxicity. Furthermore, ligand-complexed nanocarriers can improve drug specificity and antidepressant efficacy and reduce drug toxicity. Biopolymers and nanocarriers can also be employed to enhance controlled drug release and reduce the hepatic first-pass effect, hence reducing the dosing frequency. This manuscript reviews recent advances in different biopolymers, such as polysaccharides and other nanocarriers, for targeted antidepressant drug delivery to the brain. It probes nano-based strategies that can be employed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants through the oral, intranasal, and parenteral routes of administration.",

            "text": "In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in the field of immunotherapy and numerous preclinical and clinical data about immunotherapy strategies for GBM have arisen [71,74]. Immunotherapeutic approaches include: vaccines which could be classified, according to their sensitization target, in: whole tumor vaccines, tumor-associated antigens and tumor-specific antigens; cell-based therapies, which consist of the administration to the patients of effector immune cells, already sensitized and activated against tumor targets; and immune checkpoint modulators, which consist of antibodies blocking inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PDL1 [74]. However, the principal reason of the limited success of chemotherapeutic drugs against gliomas is the inability to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and to reach the tumor tissue. Several efforts have been made to enhance drug delivery to the brain, including: tight junction opening, via infusion of hyperosmotic agents; surfactants or bioactive molecules; chemical modification of the drug, in order to create more lipophilic prodrug; inhibition of efflux transporters present at the BBB, such as P-gp; convention-enhanced drug delivery; and craniotomybased drug delivery [75]. Another recent and promising therapeutic strategy is based on nanotechnology [72,[76][77][78]. Colloidal nanocarriers, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) and lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) could ameliorate effectiveness, diminish non-specific toxicity and raise stability of drugs, and could also facilitate drug delivery to the brain tumors, which is hampered by the BBB [75]. The principal features for brain-targeted nanocarriers are represented by the size and their surface charge, as well as the presence of hydrophilic polymers and ligands on the surface. Hence, cationic nanocarriers with hydrophilic surface coating are most suitable for targeting drugs to the brain [75].",

            "text": "Despite advancements in imaging techniques and tools, the exact mechanism of nanocrystal transport into the brain remains unclear. However, nanocrystals are believed to be transported via either endocytosis or passive diffusion. Despite the potential use of nanocrystal formulations for other delivery routes, bypassing the BBB and accessing the brain remains a challenge for several drugs. Nanocrystals improve the solubility, dissolution rate and pharmacokinetics of most of the drugs, however these advantageous are often insufficient to achieve BBB permeation. Parental or orally administered brain targeting drugs may aggregate and loose effectiveness at the BBB interface. The optimal formulation necessitates ideal surface modifications, additives or targeting ligands to facilitate transport. However, various alternative invasive and non-invasive methods are available for bypassing the BBB. \n\nInvasive methods: Invasive methods, including intracerebral injection and implantation of drug-eluting devices, can be used to deliver NCs to the brain to improve the permeability of drug compared to macromolecules. Although these methods circumvent the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and provide direct access to the brain they carry a high risk of infection and tissue damage, and may not be appropriate for all individuals, they may be useful in some circumstances. However, nanocrystals showed better permeability in the brain after intraperitoneal and tail vein injections (in vivo studies). Intraperitoneal administration of Px-18 nanocrystals after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion showed the ability to alleviate delayed neuronal death caused by ischemia. Px-18 nanocrystals were formulated as nanosuspensions by highpressure homogenisation. 200 However, these trials should be expanded to the clinical setting. \n\nIntranasal administration (Non-invasive method): The BBB can be bypassed by intracarotid infusion, hyperthermia techniques, transmucosal drug delivery, and intranasal administration. 201",

            "text": "Overcoming the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant challenge with regard to drug delivery to the brain. By incorporating targeting ligands, and by carefully adjusting particle sizes, nanocarriers can be customized to improve drug delivery. Among these targeting ligands, transferrin stands out due to the high expression level of its receptor (i.e., transferrin receptor) on the BBB. Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) are a promising drug nanocarrier to the brain due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and exceptional drug-loading capacity. However, an in-depth understanding of the optimal nanoparticle size and transferrin surface density, in order to maximize BBB penetration, is still lacking. To address this gap, a diverse library of pSiNPs was synthesized using bifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) linkers with methoxy or/and carboxyl terminal groups. These variations allowed us to explore different transferrin surface densities in addition to particle sizes. The effects of these parameters on the cellular association, uptake, and transcytosis in immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were investigated using multiple in vitro systems of increasing degrees of complexity. These systems included the following: a 2D cell culture, a static Transwell model, and a dynamic BBB-on-a-chip model. Our results revealed the significant impact of both the ligand surface density and size of pSiNPs on their ability to penetrate the BBB, wherein intermediate-level transferrin densities and smaller pSiNPs exhibited the highest BBB transportation efficiency in vitro. Moreover, notable discrepancies emerged between the tested in vitro assays, further emphasizing the necessity of using more physiologically relevant assays, such as a microfluidic BBB-on-a-chip model, for nanocarrier testing and evaluation.",

            "text": "In recent years, the field of nanotechnology has emerged as an important area of biomedical research. Nanoparticles (NPs) are studied in a variety of biological systems, and the use of NPs as novel therapeutic agents has been described in several experimental systems, such as cancer, eye diseases, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc. [1][2][3][4]. While this disease model has shown promise for the use of NPs and nanocarrier drug delivery systems, the issues of biodistribution and toxicity need to be addressed. The nanosize dimensions of NPs have been reported to facilitate the crossing of several biological barriers such as the skin, tight junctions of various epithelial layers, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [5,6]. \n\nThe BBB is a tight barrier of cells which separates the circulating blood from the central nervous system (CNS). The walls of BBB capillaries are composed of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC), which form tight junctions. Tight junctions contain integral membrane proteins that form a seal between adjacent endothelial cells. In addition, accessory structures that surround the BCECs include pericytes, associated astrocytes and neurons [7][8][9]. While the BBB is essential for maintaining CNS function and homeostasis, it is also a major obstacle in the treatment of many brain diseases. The poor permeability of various drugs and delivery systems across the BBB is primarily due to tight junctions, lack of capillary fenestrations and presence of efflux transporters. The BBB can reportedly block more than 98% of CNS drugs [10]. Consequently, finding new ways to deliver therapeutic drugs to the CNS safely and effectively is essential. \n\nVarious drug delivery and targeting strategies to overcome the BBB are under investigation, and a number of nanoparticle delivery systems have shown promise [10][11][12][13]. One approach is the use of surface-modified polymeric nanoparticles as drug carriers, such as dendrimers.",

            "text": "Introduction and purpose: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of capillary endothelium, in which there are three types of intercellular junctions -adherent, tight and gap junctions. Efficient therapy involves delivering a therapeutic dose of drug into a specific site in the body, and maintaining this dose for adequate time afterwards. The aim of this study is to review current knowledge of new strategies in drug delivery to CNS and the effectiveness of these methods in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment. This review was performed using the PubMed database. A brief description of the state of knowledge: Methods for delivering drugs to the brain are divided into invasive and non-invasive. Invasive methods involve temporary disrupting tight intercellular junctions of the vascular endothelial cells and delivering drugs intracerebrally or intraventricularly during neurosurgical procedures. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of nanoparticles as drug carriers to the central nervous system via blood-brain barrier. The usage of nanoparticles implies many advantages, such as non-invasive, low cost, good biodegradability, stability, ability to carry various types of agents, selectivity and ability to control drug release. Conclusions: Limited options in treating brain located tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, due to difficulties in drug penetration through the BBB engages scientists to search for new treatments. Crossing the BBB using invasive methods based on interruption of cell junctions show promising results, but they are associated with i.a. a high risk of uncontrolled influx of toxins to the CNS or ion-electrolyte imbalance, which may lead to neuronal dysfunction. Invasive methods can be effective only in tumors, while treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease is impossible. Recent studies show that nanoparticles would be a great, non-invasive alternative, but they are difficult to use with relatively low permeability through undamaged BBB. In some studies using nanoparticles as nanocarriers (EDVDox) or SYMPHONY method (combining photothermal therapy with GNS and immunotherapy of checkpoints in a mouse model) against GBM shows positive results. More research is required to confirm the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.",

In recent years, nanoparticles, especially carbon dots (CDs), exhibit many unprecedented applications for drug delivery. Several types of CDs and CD-ligand conjugates have been reported successfully penetrating the BBB, which shows a promising progress in the application of CD-based drug delivery system (DDS) for the treatment of CNS diseases. In this review, our discussion of CDs includes their classification, preparations, structures, properties, and applications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and brain tumor. Moreover, abundant functional groups on the surface, especially amine and carboxyl groups, allow CDs to conjugate with diverse drugs as versatile drug nanocarriers. In addition, structure of the BBB is briefly described, and mechanisms for transporting various molecules across the BBB and other biological barriers are elucidated. Most importantly, recent developments in drug delivery with CDs as BBB-penetrating nanodrugs and drug nanocarriers to target CNS diseases especially Alzheimer\u2019s disease and brain tumor are summarized. Eventually, future prospects of the CD-based DDS are discussed in combination with the development of artificial intelligence and nanorobots.",

Among other mucosal sites, nasal delivery is especially attractive for immunization, as the nasal epithelium is characterized by relatively high permeability, low enzymatic activity and by the presence of an important number of immunocompetent cells. In addition to these advantageous characteristics, the nasal route could offer simplified and more cost-effective protocols for vaccination with improved patient compliance. The use of nanocarriers provides a suitable way for the nasal delivery of antigenic molecules. Besides improved protection and facilitated transport of the antigen, nanoparticulate delivery systems could also provide more effective antigen recognition by immune cells. These represent key factors in the optimal processing and presentation of the antigen, and therefore in the subsequent development of a suitable immune response. In this sense, the design of optimized vaccine nanocarriers offers a promising way for nasal mucosal vaccination. [21] The usual noninvasive approach to solving the brain drug delivery problem istolipidizethe drug, The water -soluble parts of the drugs restricts BBB transport conversion of water-soluble drug into lipid-soluble prodrug is the traditional chemistry driven solution to the BBB problem as in [ Figure 1].\n\nThe treatment of CNS diseases is particularly challenging because the delivery of drug molecules to the brain is often precluded by a variety of physiological, metabolic and biochemical obstacles that collectively comprise the Blood Brain barrier, blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier, Blood tumor barrier. The present outlook for patients suffering from many types of brain diseases remains poor, but recent developments in drug delivery techniques provide reasonable hope that the formidable barriers shielding the brain may ultimately be overcome. Drug delivery directly to the brain interstitium has recently been markedly enhanced through the rational design of polymerbased drug delivery systems. Substantial progress will only come about, however, if continued vigorous research efforts to develop more therapeutic and less toxic drug molecules are paralleled by the aggressive pursuit of more effective mechanisms for delivering those drugs to brain targets.

Drug delivery vehicles can be developed that can selectively drive these simple or conjugated peptides to their site of action. Examples are mentioned in the literature for such application. A bifunctional peptide (small and soluble) and PLGA NPs (large and insoluble) resulted in relative greater EAE suppression [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]. \n\nIn a recent review article, the recent advances in nanomedicines for MS therapy were outlined [35]. Nanomaterials have the potential to carry therapeutic agents through the blood brain barrier towards the lesion sites and can promote the remyelination process, achieving neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. In addition, they can act as effective ingredients for stem cell therapies. There is an intense effort to develop nanomedicines for clinical trials by reducing their toxicity and adverse effects [90]. \n\nIn another recent article entitled \"Nanocariers as potential drug delivery candidates for overcoming the blood-brain barrier: challenges and possibilities\" [39] the different nanosystems and their potential as drug carriers are outlined.

            "text": "3] There are \u2248330,000 incident cases of brain cancers and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers worldwide each year with efficient use in the clinic is still challenged by limitations such as poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing, short half-lives, offtarget toxicities, and limited efficacy at systemically tolerated doses. [14]Drug delivery systems have been clinically approved to treat various types of cancers including but not limited to ovarian cancer, osteosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. [15]They show great promise to treat brain cancers as well by enabling a more targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, including improving BBB crossing while avoiding systemic toxicity. [16]Compared to traditional nanocarriers, stimulus-responsive systems can further improve drug delivery to brain cancers by incorporating a triggered drug release using either externally-applied stimuli such as magnetic field, ultrasound (US), heat, and light, or internal stimuli which are based on unique hallmarks of the brain tumor microenvironment like acidic pH, upregulation of enzymes or oxidants, and hypoxia. [17]here are several comprehensive reviews that discuss the benefits of employing nanomedicine for brain cancer treatment and illuminate the various strategies and advances that hold promise in combating this devastating disease. [18,19]Our review article carves out a distinct niche by focusing on the innovative and rapidly evolving field of targeted and stimulus-responsive nanoparticles.By virtue of their responsiveness, these nanocarriers can selectively target and release therapeutic payloads precisely at the tumor site, minimizing collateral damage to healthy brain tissue.Furthermore, they can navigate the blood-brain barrier, a distinctive obstacle in the delivery of drugs to the brain, with a level of finesse that traditional drug delivery systems often lack.The real-time adaptability of these nanoparticles to environmental cues, such as pH or enzymatic activity within the tumor, enhances their potential for tailored and personalized treatment strategies.In this review, we will first give an overview of brain cancers and current therapeutic options, followed by introducing the different types of nanocarrier systems used for brain cancer drug delivery.",

            "text": "The capillary microvessels of the brain have evolved to constrain the movement of molecules and cells between blood and brain, providing a natural defense against circulating toxic or infectious agents. The relative impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) results from tight junctions and adherens junctions between capillary endothelial cells formed by cell adhesion molecules. Brain endothelial cells also possess few alternate transport pathways (e.g., fenestra, transendothelial channels, pinocytotic vesicles), and express high levels of active efflux transport proteins, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR-1 or ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). The BBB maintains essential brain homeostasis but as a result, represents a significant impediment to the effective treatment of many brain diseases [1,2]. \n\nCurrent strategies to enhance drug delivery to the brain are either focused on locally circumventing the BBB through direct injections or nasal drug applications, for example, or globally through the bloodstream (using targeted delivery approaches or by opening the blood-brain barrier). Many approaches to enhance drug delivery across the BBB are under development, both by academic research groups as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. To translate basic (academic) research into safe and effective treatments for patients with devastating brain diseases, many steps in many different research areas are required. The pharmaceutical formulation (chemistry, manufacturing, control, analytics, and selection of proper nanocarriers), pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (drug delivery, neuroscience, and crossing the blood-brain barrier), and safety (toxicology, behavioral, route of drug administration, and chronic treatment) concerns should be harmonized and taken into account. One of the major challenges in the area of brain delivery is first to find an efficient vector for brain delivery using a physiological pathway mechanism to cross the BBB. These vectors can be in the form of peptides, proteins, antibodies, or some other specific formulation, such as nanoparticles, which target a specific receptor at the BBB and will cross the BBB by transcytosis.",

By using different routes of administration, many types of molecule, and even particles, can be delivered across natural body barriers. \n\nIn the active agent's route to the target site, it may encounter several biological barriers that can significantly influence the therapeutic effect, such as the reticuloendothelial system (RES), renal system and, for central nervous system (CNS) drugs, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [26], but other challenges specific to each pathology are to be overcome. The extracellular and intracellular barriers are mentioned in the Figure 4. \n\ncompared with the spherical nanoparticles and exhibited longer blood circulation than the spherical nanoparticles, which were cleared faster by the renal system [22]. \n\nThe stability and distribution of nanocarriers in the blood are also affected by their charge. Tumor vessels are more effectively targeted by positive charged nanoparticles. After extravasation from tumor vessels, a better diffusion is achieved by using neutral charged nanocarriers, compared with the positive or negative ones [23]. Also, endocytosis and cellular uptake in tumor tissue can be improved by modeling the nanocarrier's surface [24]. Neutral zeta potential-nanoparticles tend to have higher delivery efficiency than negative or positive zeta potentials-NPs (0.7%, 0.6% and 0.5%ID) [21]. \n\nThe nanoparticles have the special ability to encapsulate different active drugs, improving several characteristics such as solubility, degradation rate, clearance, and targeting properties. Hydrophilic nanoparticles are used to encapsulate poor solubility drugs. Also, the nanoparticles characteristics can be upgraded with various modifications: coating, surface charge, functional groups or targeting moieties attachment. By coating them with polyethylene glycol (PEG), the stability and solubility of the nanoparticles-and therefore the bioavailability of the drug-is increased. In order to make them target specific, the surface may also be bound with different ligands (specific molecules for the over expressed cancer ligands such as glycans) [25]. \n\nNPs have different abilities to cross the barriers.",

            "text": "The ideal polymer for brain delivery is biodegradable, biocompatible, nontoxic, nonthrombogenic, nonimmunogenic, noninflammatory and stable in blood. In addition, polymeric NPs have to withstand aggregation, and should be produced in an inexpensive and scalable manner (Gaillard, Visser, de Boer, Appeldoorn, & Rip, 2014;Lockman et al., 2002). For brain delivery of drugs, the most commonly used polymers are poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA). Recently, diblock copolymers such as Pluronic \u00ae , PEG-phospholipid conjugates, PEG-polyesters, poly(L-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PLL-g-PEG) or PEG-b-poly (L-amino acid) are also suggested as building blocks of nanocarriers (Andrieux & Couvreur, 2009;Hrkach et al., 2012). \n\nPLGA is a polyester, which is composed of biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic polymers (Park, 1995) (Figure 1). PLGA NPs typically exhibit a well-controllable release kinetics and higher encapsulation efficacy than most other polymeric NPs (Gaillard et al., 2014). PLGA is the most commonly used polymer for pharmaceutical nanoformulations, as it is approved both by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (Chigumira et al., 2015;Sankar et al., 2016;Tsai et al., 2011). Owing to its lipid-soluble nature, PLGA can also easily cross the BBB (Park, 1995) and thus is widely suggested as matrix material for the improvement of brain penetration of drugs that show poor CNS distribution (Anand et al., 2010;Ankola, Viswanad, Bhardwaj, Ramarao, & Kumar, 2007).",

Thus, the BBB also prevents the passage of various forms of therapeutic agents, nanocarriers, and their cargos. Recently, many multidisciplinary studies focus on developing cargo-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) to overcome these challenges, which are emerging as safe and effective vehicles in neurotheranostics. In this Review, first we introduce the anatomical structure and physiological functions of the BBB. Second, we present the endogenous and exogenous transport mechanisms by which NPs cross the BBB. We report various forms of nanomaterials, carriers, and their cargos, with their detailed BBB uptake and permeability characteristics. Third, we describe the effect of regulating the size, shape, charge, and surface ligands of NPs that affect their BBB permeability, which can be exploited to enhance and promote neurotheranostics. We classify typical functionalized nanomaterials developed for BBB crossing. Fourth, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in developing functional polymeric nanomaterials for applications in multimodal bioimaging, therapeutics, and drug delivery. Finally, we conclude by discussing existing challenges, directions, and future perspectives in employing functionalized nanomaterials for BBB crossing.",

            "text": "To overcome this limitation, many strategies for temporarily opening the BBB through physical impact such as magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound have been studied recently, but this raises a problem in compatibility [8]. Therefore, the use of multifunctional nanocarriers as drug delivery systems is emerging as one of the most promising strategies [9]. In general, intracellular transport of nanocarriers is mediated by the vesicular system, and three types of intracellular vesicles are involved (e.g., clathrin-mediated, caveolae-mediated and macropinocytotic vesicles) [10]. Therefore, in order to pass through these pathways, nanocarriers covalently bound with specific targeting ligands to guide the drug across the BBB to specific sites in each tumor type. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of nanocarriers differ depending on the material, size, shape (mesoporous structure, rod shape, particle), and the selected ligand. This allows customization for increased brain-targeted delivery of PS or therapeutic drugs. Although many PS nanocarriers are still in the early stages of translation, many advances have been made in recent years for functional nanomedicines based on BBB crossing. \n\nAnother advantage of nanoparticles is that they can increase the low solubility of PS, prolong blood circulation, promote targeted delivery and cellular uptake, while protecting the drug from degradation. This makes it an interesting alternative to traditional PDT because the nanostructures can enable efficient transport of PS and ameliorate the lack of anticancer activity [11]. To date, in addition to micellar self-assembly techniques for PS delivery, numerous nanoparticles, such as gold, silica, upconversion, and carbon-based particles, have been studied to increase their phototoxic properties and to increase their concentrations in tumor sites. \n\nIn this study, we classify brain tumors according to malignancy and examine the applicability of PDT for each type. We discuss the use of PDT and the properties and clinical applications of nanoparticles as potential delivery tools for PS delivery.",

Therefore, drug delivery methods that could target virus present in these areas may play important role in modern drug development mainly for CNS protection. Furthermore, nanoenabled delivery systems have been made that offer more promising solution to enhance the targeted International Scholarly Research Notices delivery of the drugs into the brain. Therefore, drugs which are loaded with nanocarriers can easily target virus multiplication inside brain because they could easily pass through BBB. In addition, few drug carriers are proteins and its deficiency (P-glycoprotein) at the BBB inhibits the efflux activity of certain biomolecules at the blood brain barrier [170]. \n\nMore often, most of the drug delivery methods are based on structure activity relationships, drug-to-drug receptor interactions, and structure transport relationships mainly membrane permeation. In addition, drugs which are selected based on throughput screening may show higher binding in silico, but in reality in vivo systems invariably show poor membrane permeation because of low binding by target receptor. Therefore, it seems very difficult to pass on drug more simply through the blood barrier in theoretically relevant concentration and underlying experimental aspect of drug targeting [27]. More often, drugs undergo insignificant transport through the brain capillary endothelium that makes up the blood brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. But, in vivo system drug must bind to some specific receptor; if binding occurs partially, it will affect drug delivery. Further, in vivo condition absorption of drug in neuronal and other brain cells seems to be difficult after drug delivery, because its route is obstructed in many ways. Second, drug may convert into noninteracting metabolite or a portion of it might show higher binding to other ligand/s mainly proteins. Though, therapeutically, drug seems to be more appropriate by biological system but it becomes ineffective or attains some highly reactive active molecular when it reaches inside brain cells. If drug becomes able to pass through the barrier, it might adhere to the unwanted protein [171].",

Nano-medicines have shown considerable promise in CNS drug delivery over the last few decades due to their nanosized range, certain physicochemical features, and capacity to leverage surface-tailored biocompatible and biodegradable nanomaterials (Kaur et al., 2008). Site-specific transport of medicines including other chemicals across the BBB using nanotechnology might potentially be tailored, which can perform specific roles whenever needed. The medication, which is a component of the nanoengineered complex with other essential activities, is the pharmacologically active component to be given, for example, encapsulating the active drug, protecting it from enzymatic degradation, allowing it to release at certain pH, crossing the BBB, and targeting specific brain cells (Silva, 2008). Liposomes, PNPs, SLNs, micelles, dendrimers, and numerous other pharmacological nanocarriers have all been created (Rajadhyaksha et al., 2011;Wong et al., 2012;Ozkizilcik et al., 2017).",

[109] generated Angiopep-2 (Ang) and trans-activator of transcription peptides (TAT)-modified EVs, and loaded DOX through electroporation for glioma treatment. The high affinity between Ang and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 enabled EVs to cross the BBB, and the cell-penetrating ability of TAT breached the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), thus improving the efficacy of chemotherapeutic molecules for brain tumors. \n\nResearchers have developed novel combinations of chemotherapy with extracellular vesicles (EVs) inspired by their natural benefits. Recently, a combined \"eat me/don't eat me\" strategy was developed to achieve mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) escape and efficient drug delivery. Cationized mannan-modified EVs derived from DC2.4 cells were administered to saturate the MPS (eat me strategy). Then, nanocarriers fused to CD47enriched EVs originating from human serum were administered to avoid phagocytosis by the MPS (don't eat me strategy). The nanocarriers were also loaded with DOX and functionalized with a novel organotropism peptide to promote tumor tissue accumulation and cancer cell uptake (eat me strategy) [110]. This study sheds light on overcoming phagocytic evasion and provides a strategy for significantly improving therapeutic outcomes, potentially enabling active drug delivery via targeted nanomedicines.",

Despite enormous advances on brain research, central nervous system (CNS) disorders remain the world\u2019s leading cause of disability, in part due to the inability of the majority of drugs to reach the brain parenchyma. Many attempts to use nanomedicines as CNS drug delivery systems (DDS) were made; among the various non-invasive approaches, nanoparticulate carriers and, particularly, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) seem to be the most interesting strategies. In particular, the ability of poly-lactide-co-glycolide NPs (PLGA-NPs) specifically engineered with a glycopeptide (g7), conferring to NPs\u2019 ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in rodents at a concentration of up to 10% of the injected dose, was demonstrated in previous studies using different routes of administrations. Most of the evidence on NP uptake mechanisms reported in the literature about intracellular pathways and processes of cell entry is based on in vitro studies. Therefore, beside the particular attention devoted to increasing the knowledge of the rate of in vivo BBB crossing of nanocarriers, the subsequent exocytosis in the brain compartments, their fate and trafficking in the brain surely represent major topics in this field.",

            "text": "Nanocarriers are used as drug delivery vehicles, both in research and clinical settings, because of their ability to encapsulate therapeutics and give controlled release in a biological environment [1][2][3][4]. Many potential pharmaceutics have sufficient in vitro efficacy, but fail to make it through clinical trials because of poor bioavailability [5], which nanocarrier formulations have the potential to improve. Nanocarrier-drug conjugates can improve drug solubility and can also increase the lifetime of a drug in vivo; this is especially important for protein therapeutics, which are particularly sensitive to changes in environment and are often metabolized to an inactive form before they have reached their target site [6]. \n\nThe sustained release mechanism from a nanocarrier can allow the dosage of drug administered to be lowered, therefore increasing safety, and can increase time spent in the therapeutic window without the need for sequential dosing [7]. If targeted, drug delivery devices can be used to sequester drugs that have harmful off-target effects, such as cancer therapeutics, from the rest of the body [8]. Various nanocarrier targeting strategies are available, for instance, surface functionalization with antibodies, peptides, and proteins [9,10], and smart materials have been developed which release cargo upon a stimulus in vivo, for example reduced pH and hypoxia [11], both of which are found in solid tumors. \n\nIn addition to increasing the safety and activity of drugs, nanocarriers are also used to target specific areas of the body which would be otherwise difficult for the free drug to reach, for example to the central nervous system (CNS), where drugs must pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [12]. The BBB is a protective layer around the brain that only allows permeation of molecules that are highly lipophilic and usually less than 500 Da [13]. Many therapeutics, especially protein-based, do not fit these criteria, leading to significant efforts to deliver drugs to the brain inside nanocarriers [14,15].",

            "text": "A meticulous transmission between neuronal networks demands the segregation of the central nervous system (CNS) from peripheral organs that is attained via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is a highly distinguishing structure enriched with specialized cells that coordinates transmission of molecules across neuronal and peripheral compartments. However, the BBB restricts various neuroprotective biomolecules and limits the overall transportation of therapeutic molecules in the CNS. Different transportation schemes are being exploited for the direct bypassing of the BBB via noninvasive and invasive approaches. Hence, for successful transportation of drug molecules across the BBB, medicinal, physicochemical and pharmaceutical approaches need to be taken into consideration. Improvement in physicochemical properties of drug for BBB-mediated transportation via noninvasive strategy is one of pharmaceutical approach. Since past few years, nanotechnological approaches are being utilized for improvement in drug targeting efficiency to overcome the obstacles in CNS delivery [1]. Nanotechnology is a reliable platform for delivery of drug molecule irrespective of its physicochemical characteristics, as these nano-entities encapsulate drug molecules with inherent hydrophilicity and lipophilicity. Although various carriers have been exploited for delivery of neurotherapeutics, target-orientated nanotherapeutic delivery is more precise for brain targeting. As the BBB is encompassed with various receptors, transporters and channels hence, drugenclosed nanocarriers uptake via these routes can improve the extent of drug transport. Further understanding of the BBB's inherent nature and formulation strategies to utilize these pathways without damaging the BBB is a prerequisite for development of successful neurotherapeutics. In this review article, we have discussed the structural orientation of the BBB, therapeutic delivery strategies across the BBB, interplay between neurological sequelae and BBB integrity, factors influencing BBB destruction and nanotechnological fa\u00e7ade for delivery of neurotherapeutics [2,3].",

            "text": "Plasma proteins and other compounds that are neurotoxic at high concentrations damage neurons and other brain-resident cells when allowed free access to the brain. For example, the blood plasma components thrombin and plasmin can induce apoptosis or lead to seizures [231,232], while high levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate are toxic to neurons [233]. Therefore, passive diffusion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds across the BBB is restricted by the presence of TJs and efflux transporters, respectively, while active transport through substrate-specific transporters and receptormediated transcytosis allows for the regulated uptake and excretion of compounds [234] in order to maintain brain homeostasis (Figure 1).\n\nThe encapsulation of drugs in a carrier system that is able to cross the BBB seems a promising strategy for obtaining brain penetration of medicinal compounds while providing several additional advantages [235]. Techniques are being used to develop nanocarriers with a high drug-loading profile [236] and those that aid controlled and sustained release of the drug of interest [237][238][239][240]. By doing so, the need for frequent dosing is reduced. Nanovehicles can improve the bio-availability of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds by providing protection against chemical and biological degradation and improving target-site delivery [241][242][243]. Additionally, nanoparticle design can be optimized for the development of precision medicine, where the personal characteristics of patients in conjunction with specified nanomedicine engineering allow for patient-specific disease treatments [244].\n\nHowever, systemically delivered nanocarriers still face several hurdles, including the acidic environment of the gastrointestinal tract (when administered orally), clearance by the liver and spleen, clearance by immune cells, and physical barriers that prevent easy access to target sites [245]. Overall, for in vivo efficacy, nanocarriers need to show high stability, low toxicity, prevent clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, and efficiently accumulate at the target site [229,246,247]. Hence, the physicochemical properties of the nanocarrier (i.e., size, shape, charge",

            "text": "\uf0b7 One of the major disadvantages of brain-targeted drug delivery is the difficulty of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is a complex and dynamic structure that protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood. The BBB has several mechanisms to prevent the entry of foreign molecules, such as tight junctions between endothelial cells, efflux transporters, metabolic enzymes, and immune cells. Therefore, only a small fraction of drugs can reach the brain after systemic administration, and most of them have low specificity and selectivity for their target sites. \n\nTo overcome this obstacle, various strategies have been developed to enhance the transport of drugs across the BBB, such as modifying the physicochemical properties of drugs, using nanocarriers or prodrugs, targeting specific receptors or transporters on the BBB, or disrupting the BBB temporarily or locally. However, these strategies also have some drawbacks, such as increased toxicity, immunogenicity, instability, or cost of the drug delivery systems, or potential damage to the BBB integrity and function. \n\n\uf0b7 Another disadvantage of brain-targeted drug delivery is the heterogeneity and complexity of the brain tissue, which poses challenges for achieving uniform and optimal distribution of drugs within the brain. The brain consists of different regions, cell types, and microenvironments, each with distinct anatomical and physiological characteristics. Moreover, the brain is constantly changing due to processes such as neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, inflammation, aging, and disease. Therefore, it is difficult to predict and control how drugs will interact with different components of the brain after delivery. \n\nTo address this issue, some approaches have been proposed to improve the targeting and localization of drugs within the brain, such as using magnetic fields or ultrasound to guide or activate the drug delivery systems, or engineering the drug delivery systems to respond to specific stimuli or cues in the brain microenvironment. However, these approaches also have some limitations, such as requiring external devices or invasive procedures, or having low spatial and temporal resolution. \n\n\uf0b7 A third disadvantage of brain-targeted drug delivery is the ethical and social implications of manipulating the brain function with drugs. The brain is not only responsible for vital functions such as cognition, emotion, and behavior, but also for personal identity and moral values.",

Recently, it has been identified that membrane-bound vesicles of brain endothelial cells influence the formation of nanotubes involved in the construction of the BBB (Mentor and Fisher, 2021). In addition to crossing the BBB is necessary to target specific cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia involved in specific brain diseases. Several DDSs, including nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles, and artificial vesicles have been studied for brain drug delivery (Dong 2018;Nuzzo et al., 2021).

Among these strategies, nanocarriers (NCs), e.g., liposome, nanoparticle, micelle, nanoemulsion, nanocrystal, and dendrimer, have emerged as promising approaches that have received increasing research attention from both academia and pharmaceutical industry. 7,8 Although many nanoformulations for non-CNS therapies are widely used in clinical practice, clinical development of brain-directed nanoformulations is considerably lagging behind with no clinically approved CNS nanomedicines to date. 2,9 Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials of NCs specifically for CNS indications only account for 4% of the total numbers of trials of NCs (data extracted in August 2020) (Table 1). Together, these facts imply that current nanodelivery approaches may be inefficient in surmounting the BBB to an extent that significantly improves the therapeutic index compared to the drug itself.",

Cell-derived nanovesicles, such as exosomes, are natural carriers with intrinsic features including crossing various biological barriers, stability during circulation and potential targeting ability (Pegtel & Gould, 2019;Kalluri & LeBleu, 2020). \n\nDespite a large number of cell-based carriers has been explored for drug delivery, blood cell-based vehicles have shown a variety of functions suitable for brain drug delivery (Sun et al., 2017). Specific properties of blood cell-based delivery systems include high biocompatibility, long circulation, targeted drug delivery, and suitability for a wide range of cargoes (Sun et al., 2017). Since blood cell-based delivery systems hold great promises for facilitating the development of therapeutics for brain diseases therapy from blood-tobrain, we introduce challenges for brain drug delivery and summarize the recent progress on the study of blood cellbased delivery systems for brain drug delivery (Table 1). Cell types in the blood include erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes. Here, we focus on these blood cells and their derived membranes or vesicles as delivery vehicles (Figure 1). A specific emphasis is placed on the different features of blood cells. The advantages of specific cells for different brain disease applications are covered in depth. Finally, future directions and challenges of the utility of blood cell-based delivery systems for brain drug delivery are discussed.",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including neurodegenerative, neoplastic, and neuropsychiatric disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent around the world due to rapidly aging populations (Hebert et al., 2013). Treatment of various CNS disorders has always been a challenging task, despite the rapid development of multiple novel treatment strategies and drug approaches in recent years. Of these, development of efficient brain targeted drug delivery system is crucial for successful therapy of CNS diseases. However, the presence of the complex blood brain barrier (BBB) is one of the major obstacles that limits therapeutics entry to the CNS region (Jafari et al., 2019). The BBB, comprises brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytic end-feet, acts as a selective physical barrier that prevents approximately 98% of small molecular weight agents and nearly 100% of macromolecules, from crossing from the blood stream into the brain tissues (Pardridge, 2005;Jafari et al., 2019;Wong et al., 2019). \n\nConsequently, numerous studies have proposed promising strategies to improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain by circumventing or overcoming the BBB during the last decades. These strategies include intracerebroventricular injections (Lopachev et al., 2019), convection enhanced delivery (Zhan and Wang, 2018), inhibition of efflux transporters (Sanchez-Covarrubias et al., 2014), chemical modification (Al-Ahmady, 2018), and the application of hyperosmotic agents (Patel et al., 2009) or focused ultrasound (Dauba et al., 2020;Lin et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2021a), and so on. However, the limitation of these administration routes is marred by safety concerns, invasive, and erratic efficacy.",

Moerner Nanomedicine has emerged as a revolutionary strategy of drug delivery.However, fundamentals of the nano-neuro interaction are elusive.In particular, whether nanocarriers can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and release the drug cargo inside the brain, a basic process depicted in numerous books and reviews, remains controversial.Here, we develop an optical method, based on stimulated Raman scattering, for imaging nanocarriers in tissues.Our method achieves a suite of capabilities-single-particle sensitivity, chemical specificity, and particle counting capability.With this method, we visualize individual intact nanocarriers crossing the BBB of mouse brains and quantify the absolute number by particle counting.The fate of nanocarriers after crossing the BBB shows remarkable heterogeneity across multiple scales.With a mouse model of aging, we find that blood-brain transport of nanocarriers decreases with age substantially.This technology would facilitate development of effective therapeutics for brain diseases and clinical translation of nanocarrier-based treatment in general.",

            "text": "Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various mental disorders, still pose a public health challenge with significant impact on society, affecting healthcare systems, communities, and individuals' well-being. Drug delivery to the brain is difficult, as most drug candidates developed for neurological diseases have limited access to brain targets due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [1]. To increase drug delivery and to avoid degradation in the circulation, a possible approach is to encapsulate therapeutic molecules into nanocarriers [2][3][4]. \n\nNon-ionic surfactant based nanovesicles called niosomes, offer several advantages for therapeutics' delivery to the brain. Niosomes are biocompatible, biodegradable and less likely to induce adverse effects. These nanoparticles (NPs) can be easily modified to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic agents, including antibodies, but also to release them in a controlled manner, reducing frequency of administration [5]. Encapsulation of therapeutic antibodies within NPs, not only provides a protective shield against degradation and immune recognition, but also enhances their solubility and, consequently, bioavailability. To mitigate off-target toxicity, niosomes can also be designed to target the brain by surface functionalization with targeting moieties, that specifically interact with brain endothelial cells, as previously showed by our group [6][7][8]. Peptides that facilitate the passage of drug molecules or nanocarrier systems across the BBB are called BBB peptide shuttles (BBBpS). Drug-conjugated BBBpS or nanocarriers tagged with BBB-specific biomolecules enhance drug delivery across the BBB by utilizing physiological transport pathways, including carrier-mediated, receptor-mediated or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [9,10]. \n\nThe cationic 7-residue PepH3 peptide (AGILKRW), a BBBpS derived from Dengue virus type-2 capsid protein, previously reported by our group, showed an effective penetration across culture BBB models by adsorptivemediated transcytosis [11,12].",

The BBB prevents the flow of Open Access *Correspondence: hfahmy@sci.cu.edu.eg; heba_moh_fahmi@cu.edu.eg potentially harmful substances to protect the brain [1]. Recently, nanomedicine's new approaches tend to overcome BBB for drug delivery into CNS. \n\nMesoporous silica is used in vivo as an intelligent drug delivery system to treat many neurodegenerative illnesses. Silica is a natural compound used as secure and cost-effective material with few side effects [2]. MSNs are chemically stable compounds; they can be easily synthesized with a large surface area, and diverse pore diameters may be designed to transport various medicines of various sizes [3]. \n\nNanotechnology-synthesizing techniques improve MSNs to be more biocompatible, have better biodistribution, possess controlled drug release regardless of the surrounding environment, and have good drug loading capacity with better cellular uptake and negligible toxicity [4]. Baghirov et al. studied MSNs' effect on BBB. Functionalized nanocarrier with PEG-PEI copolymers. This polymer coating improved rod-shaped MSNs absorption by brain cells without damaging the BBB or being toxic [5]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that MSNs effectively target receptors on the endothelial cell membrane of the brain, including transferring (Tf), low-density lipoprotein, lactoferrin (Lf), mannose, folic acid (FA), RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid), and insulin [6]. Song et al. functionalized MSNs with Lf, which caused Lf-mediated transcytosis. They covered the nanocarrier's surface with PEG to prevent reticuloendothelial system cleaning. In brain cells, 25 nm nanoparticles had the most efficient transport. Lf-functionalized MSNs that cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis can transfer drugs to the brain [7].",

It has been demonstrated that selecting an appropriate drug carrier based on the characteristics of the drug can improve its physical and chemical properties and enhance its availability. Currently, viral and non-viral vectors are the main drug carriers used in clinical and medical trials [29] . However, both types of vectors have their limitations. Viral vectors, such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and adeno-associated virus, have low specificity, limited safety profiles, inadequate targeting capabilities, and potential carcinogenicity, which hinder their clinical application [30] . On the other hand, non-viral vectors, such as nanoparticle vectors, are limited by the toxicity of the raw materials used, the availability of suitable materials as vectors, and the low efficiency of drug encapsulation [31] . In comparison to other extracellular vesicles, exosomes have the advantage of being smaller in size, which allows them to penetrate tissue barriers more effectively, including the blood-brain barrier and bloodthymus barrier. The blood-brain barrier, for example, allows particles below 200 nm in size to pass through freely, without considering factors such as shape, composition, or stiffness [22] . However, this smaller size of exosomes may present challenges in terms of limited drug loading capacity.",

            "text": "Actually, there is a great number of CNS disorders that need the medication to get to the brain evading the complications caused by the blood-brain barrier and the difficulties related to systemic administration like biological availability and side-effects of the drug. Therefore, many attempts have been tried for the design of strategies to overcome these problems. One of these is the usage of the nose-to-brain delivery route which is an easy and safe approach for targeting the drug to the brain. The immediate link between the nose and brain allows the passage of drugs from the nose to the brain alongside both the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. This transportation process takes place through two passageways; intracellular and extracellular. Nevertheless, the nose-into-brain delivery represents a big dare primarily owing to fast removal of the drug through mucociliary clearance, in addition to other factors such as enzymatic degradation. Therefore, a variety of nasal formulations were developed to bypass the shortcomings of the nasal formulations such as the use of nanocarriers. Out of these nanocarriers, lipid nanocapsules have acquired a great attention owing to their capability to achieve targeted and sustained drug delivery for hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic drugs in addition to their protection of the encapsulated drug from tissue environment. As a final conclusion, lipid nanocapsules will proceed to provide solutions for several significant challenges. However, the impact of lipid nanocapsules and other nanoscale materials on human healthiness are still not fully understood due to the relatively new nature of nanotechnology. Therefore, multiple studies are so far in progress to determine the long-term safety of lipid nanocapsules.",

            "text": "Background/objectives: The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) significantly limits the treatment of central nervous system disorders, such as schizophrenia, by restricting drug delivery to the brain. This study explores the potential of intranasal clozapine-loaded lipid nanocapsules (IN LNCsClo) as a targeted and effective delivery system to the brain. Methods: LNCsClo were prepared using the phase inversion technique and characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE%), and in vitro drug release. The pharmacokinetic, safety, and pharmacodynamic effects of LNCsClo were then evaluated in a rat model through intranasal (IN) administration and compared with those of oral and intravenous (IV) Clo solutions. Results: LNCsClo were prepared using a phase inversion technique, resulting in a nanocarrier with a particle size of 28.6 \u00b1 3.6 nm, homogenous dispersion, and high EE% (84.66 \u00b1 5.66%). Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that IN LNCsClo provided enhanced Clo brain bioavailability, rapid CNS targeting, and prolonged drug retention compared to oral and intravenous routes. Notably, the area under the curve (AUC) for brain concentration showed more than two-fold and eight-fold increases with LNCsClo, compared to IV and oral solutions, respectively, indicating improved brain-targeting efficiency. Safety assessments indicated that LNCsClo administration mitigated Clo-associated metabolic side effects, such as hyperglycemia, insulin imbalance, and liver enzyme alterations. Additionally, pharmacodynamic studies showed that LNCsClo significantly improved antipsychotic efficacy and reduced schizophrenia-induced hyperactivity, while preserving motor function. Conclusions: These results highlight the potential of IN LNCsClo as a novel drug delivery system, offering improved therapeutic efficacy, reduced systemic side effects, and better patient compliance in the treatment of schizophrenia and potentially other CNS disorders.",

            "text": "Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles have diverse drug delivery capabilities making them well suited for brain-targeted applications [21] (Fig. 1). Formulated from natural and synthetic polymers, polymeric nanoparticles are able to encapsulate therapeutics agents ranging from small molecules to biologic macromolecules [22]. An advantage of polymeric nanoparticles is that the polymer composition and surface properties may be adjusted to control the release rate and promote cell type-specific delivery of the therapeutic contents [23,24]. In preclinical models, multiple polymeric nanoformulations have been successfully tested for brain delivery applications, including but not limited to polyamidoamine (PAMAM), Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic acid hyperbranched polyglycerol (PLA-HPG), and chitosan [25][26][27][28]. PAMAM-bound siRNAs, for example, showed greater efficacy and accumulation in the brain compared to the free siRNA [29]. FDA-approved PLGA nanoparticles are also capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and are remarkably safe as the polymers are broken down to lactic acid and co-glycolic acidsnatural metabolites of glycolysis [30]. For brain targeted applications, one preclinical study revealed that PLGA nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 188 significantly improved central nervous system (CNS) delivery [31]. With improved sustained-release properties, PLA and PLA-HPG nanoparticles [32,33] are being investigated as a potential delivery system for Alzheimer's disease treatments [34,35]. To improve brain biodistribution, other researchers have found that conjugating trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide to PLA nanoparticles dramatically increased brain uptake in mice [36]. Several other surface modifications to polymeric nanoparticles have also been shown to increase brain delivery of the therapeutic cargo [37][38][39].\n\nAlthough polymeric nanoparticles have many positive characteristics for brain delivery, they",

For over 30 years Canadian scientists from leading Canadian research-intense academic institutions, pharmaceutical industry and the biotechnology community have played a vital role in the development of and implementation of novel drug delivery technologies that have made an impact on a number of diseases from cancer to infectious diseases. \n\nDrug delivery encompasses a spectrum of approaches, formulations, technologies, and systems for carrying active pharmaceutical ingredients into the body. The main focus is to achieve optimal pharmacokinetic profile, often attained by active targeting. To achieve this goal, the drugs are formulated in chemical drug delivery systems, incorporated in devices or combination of these two strategies [1]. Drug delivery technologies modify drug release profile, absorption, distribution and elimination for the benefit of improving product efficacy and safety, as well as patient convenience and compliance [2]. \n\nThis Special Issue on Drug Delivery Technologies in Canada highlights the progress of drug delivery research and development within Canada. We invited articles on all aspects of drug delivery sciences from pre-clinical formulation development to human clinical trials that bring to light the world-class research currently undertaken in Canada. In the next paragraphs we summarize the contributions to our special issue. Babu V.Sajesh et al. [3] discusses the limitations faced by therapeutic agents to reach their target in the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier by using HAV6, a cadherin binding peptide, the blood-brain barrier was opened transiently, leading to improvement of the delivery of a therapeutic agent in a murine brain tumour model. This proof-of-principle study is a novel avenue for drug delivery to the central nervous system. \n\nDavid Fortin [4] in his paper entitled \"Drug Delivery Technology to the CNS in the Treatment of Brain Tumors: The Sherbrooke Experience\" also addresses challenges regarding drug delivery to the central nervous system and reviews strategies encompassing the path of the drug discovery from laboratory explorations to clinical applications.",

The Neuron network is very complicated, and to maintain the functionality of all the 86 billion neurons in the human brain, they need an adequate blood supply, provided through a vast, well-organized vascular network. Several cell types work specifically to conduct the blood into the cerebral blood flow and maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. 150 The primary requirement for the active absorption of drugs or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is to reach the absorbing barrier before reaching the BBB. Also, to ensure a controlled release profile, adequate absorption of APIs is required as they should pass through various barriers (Figure 9).\n\nCNM family can be employed as highly efficient nanocarriers for drug delivery into the brain. Besides drug delivery applications, they have neuroregenerative activity and can also be used as central nervous system (therapeutic agents. 151 Functional nanoparticles used in ND treatments are often fabricated using encapsulating active components into nanocarriers. These nanocarrier complexes provide prolonged drug circulation, protect the drug from degradation and elimination, enhance BBB accessibility, lessen cytotoxicity, and sometimes can actively reach the brain cells to perform more selective treatments. 152 CNTs have much innovative potential for applications in neuro biomedicine, and one of the main applications in neuroscience is target drug delivery to treat ND. Single-walled carboxylated CNTs (SWCNT-COOH) have been successfully used as neuro-drug carriers to deliver levodopa (LD), the anti-Parkinson drug. The complex of SWCNT-COOH with LD was able to slow, sustainable release of the drug over a period of 20 h. 116 Functionalized MWCNTs nanosystems caused an improved ability to penetrate the BBB, and it demonstrated high-efficient anti-tumor activity against orthotopic glioma. Therefore, developing such functionalized MWCNTs provides a novel technique for discovering nextgeneration nanodrugs to precisely treat orthotopic brain tumors. 117 Misfolding and aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is a key factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence. Therefore, one of the effective strategies to treat AD is the inhibition of amy",

            "text": "The BBB is a major barrier to effective drug delivery to the brain. The BBB consists of brain capillary endothelial cells and tight junctions between them, which prevent the penetration of almost all macromolecules and more than 98% of low-molecular-weight drugs [69,70]. Therefore, the development of targeted liposomes capable of crossing the BBB and delivering therapeutic molecules to the brain is of great interest [71]. Attempts to encapsulate OPs antidotes in nanoparticles have been made before, and the possibility of nanoscale drug delivery systems to act as carriers for AChE reactivators is discussed in detail, for example, in the reviews of [12,72]. For this purpose, different nanocarriers can be used, including liposomes [73], solid-lipid nanoparticles [19,20,74], human serum albumin nanoparticles [75], and mesoporous silica nanoparticles [76]. Herein, we continued our work in this direction to increase the efficiency of AChE reactivation upon the modification of liposomes with other surfactants and to study the mechanism of the neuroprotective action of the formulated 2-PAM. The size and charge of particles play a key role in their clearance, circulation time in the blood, and ability to pass through the BBB. In particular, it has been shown that nanocontainers smaller than 200 nm have increased circulation in the blood and, therefore, are in contact with the BBB for a longer time when the drug is absorbed by the brain [77]. In our case, all obtained liposomes were about 100-110 nm in size, which may allow them to circulate in the blood for a long time and be better absorbed by BBB endothelial cells. The effect of the surface charge of liposomes on the ability of particles to be absorbed by the brain tissues was investigated by injecting cationic, anionic, and neutral liposomal systems into the carotid arteries of rats [78]. It was shown that charged liposomes interacted more effectively with cells and that cationic liposomes had the highest concentration in the brain [78,79].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. The main components of the BBB are the endothelial cells (i.e., astrocytes and pericytes), which form a continuous sheet covering the inner surface of the brain's microvessels. They are interconnected by tight junctions, which are critical to both the control of BBB vascular permeability [1] and to the protection of the brain from various circulating toxins and other harmful molecules [2,3]. Neurons and microglia, which are other neurovascular unit components, play a different role in the BBB [4,5]. \n\nDue to the endothelial cell continuous sheet, 98% of small-molecule drugs and 100% of large-molecule drugs do not pass through the BBB, thus failing to deliver the drugs to the brain tissue [6]. Therefore, in order to develop efficient delivery systems for the treatment of many brain diseases, it is crucial to investigate the carriers' ability of getting through the BBB [7]. \n\nIn the last decade, nanoparticle-based systems have been widely studied as effective therapeutic agents for cancer targeting and therapy. In this context, organic functionalized magnetic iron nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn a lot of interest since they combine the versatility of the surface functionalization with the magnetic properties and the non-toxic biocompatible nature of their core. MNPs are widely adopted for theranostic applications (diagnostic and therapeutic) such as protein and cell sorting and manipulation [8,9], cell labeling [10,11], magnetically controlled drug delivery [12,13], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [14,15], and hyperthermia [16][17][18][19]. To be efficiently used for biomedical applications, MNPs should be capable of crossing cell membranes and, in particular, of passing through the various biological barriers. The modification of the MNPs surface with functional molecules has often been used to improve their cell internalization, but in many cases, the crossing of the BBB remains a problem.",

            "text": "The treatment of neurological pathologies often suffers from serious drawbacks related to the difficulty of delivering drugs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to the site of interest at an effective concentration [1]. The BBB is a complex system composed of endothelial cells tight junctions, pericytes, and astrocytes which, together with the efflux proteins on the BBB surface, are considered the \"security wall\" of the central nervous system, regulating the entry of foreign substances in the brain [2]. Lipophilic xenobiotics can passively diffuse from the blood to the brain by crossing both the apical and basal membranes of endothelial cells [3]. On the other hand, hydrophilic compounds necessary for the neuronal functionality (e.g., glucose, \u03b1-amino acids, and vitamins) can be up-taken within the brain via specific cell membrane transporters [4]. Finally, high molecular weight molecules (e.g., peptide and proteins), which are too large for cell membrane transporters, can cross the endothelium to a limited degree through a vesicular route, either by specific receptor-mediated or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [5]. \n\nSuch a complex barrier, although being effective in protecting the brain from toxic molecules, hinders the entry of a large proportion of pharmacologically active molecules suitable for the treatment of many brain disease and disorders [6]. Thus, a significant challenge consists in designing therapeutic approaches to increase the number of drugs capable to overcome the BBB and/or improve their concentration in the brain. Biodegradable nanocarriers have been proposed as adequate solution to meet these needs by virtue of their small size and the ability to easily penetrate into cells, thus efficiently delivering drugs in the central nervous system [7].",

Thus, a significant challenge consists in designing therapeutic approaches to increase the number of drugs capable to overcome the BBB and/or improve their concentration in the brain. Biodegradable nanocarriers have been proposed as adequate solution to meet these needs by virtue of their small size and the ability to easily penetrate into cells, thus efficiently delivering drugs in the central nervous system [7]. Among others, natural polysaccharides (PS) were widely explored as base materials of drug delivery systems because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and muco-adhesion properties, with many of them being tested as neuroprotective and therapeutic agents in many cerebral pathological conditions [8], such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) [9], ischemia [10], neurodegenerative diseases [11,12], and glioma [13,14]. From an application point of view, despite some undeniable limitations such as the significant natural variability (e.g., the large range of molecular weights and the variation between batches), challenging synthesis and poor mechanical properties [15,16], PS shows favorable characteristics for the preparation of drug delivery systems. The presence of functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino) allows tailored chemical derivatization, whereas the ability to interact with biological tissues via noncovalent bonding (e.g., electrostatic interactions) promotes the biorecognition of specific receptors on cell membranes. Furthermore, polysaccharide-containing carriers (PSC) have demonstrated enormous potential for drug delivery to the brain, with several mechanisms suggested for crossing the BBB [17,18].",

They are also classified as nanospheres, nanocapsules, or nanoparticles based upon the dispersion of drug within the nanocarrier. Different types and modifications of nanocarriers have been studied for improved delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The use of nanocarriers can improve brain delivery of ARVs in several ways. Many of the agents delivered are well-established substrates of ABC transporters. These include P-gp substrates, e.g. \n\nNanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" [63]. This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range [64]. This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides [65]. Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models [15,[66][67][68]. These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based. \n\nDendrimers are a versatile class of regularly-branched macromolecules with unique structural and topologic features.",

Failure of the majority of therapies targeted to the brain is at the point of BBB where most of the drugs fail to pass the barrier. BBB is a large complex structure responsible for maintaining a tightly regulated microenvironment inside the brain that blocks substances from passing from the blood into the brain (67). It is made up of the monolayer of endothelial cells, which make up the capillary walls of the brain, joined by tight junctions, which involve cell adhesion molecules like Occludin, Claudin, and other cell adhesion molecules. Other proteins associated with BBB include perivascular macrophages, astrocytes, and pericytes (68). The BBB regulates the active and passive transport-mediated entry of important nutrients and oxygen into the brain and also prevents the entry of neurotoxins, pathogens, and other unwanted substances into the brain (69). The proper operation of BBB is required for maintaining vital functions of the brain because any breach at blood and brain interface can lead to numerous neurological conditions like PD and AD (70). To address this limitations, nanoparticles have emerged as safe and potential molecules to deliver drugs or therapeutic molecules across the BBB (71). Nanoparticles mostly ranging from 1 to 1,000 nm, have the ability to carry high drug concentration, increased drug transmission, low toxicity in the brain along with physical and chemical stability. A variety of natural, synthetic and inorganic nanocarriers such as Polymeric and liposomal particles have been developed for the identifying and managing neurodegenerative diseases (72)(73)(74). Inorganic nanoparticles (Gold, Silver, and Cerium) are most exploited for targeted brain drug delivery and imaging applications across BBB due to their size, stability, surface modification, and functional property (75,76).",

Indeed, one of the main advantages is the potential to optimize nanoparticle design through size, shape, and surface modifications to improve interaction and diffusion through cells and tissues. There is also the possibility of conjugating two or more therapeutic compounds for combination therapy, including nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, and anticancer drugs [107]. \n\nFor brain targeting, some requirements must be met: non-toxicity, small size, biocompatibility, high targeting efficiency, long and stable blood circulation, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and biodegradability. Ideally, these nanosystems should also be easy to produce, cost-effective, and easy to scale up [108]. Diverse nanocarriers have been explored based on the method of preparation, type of materials used, drug loading, and release behavior. Special attention has been given to liposomes, micelles, inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric and dendrimers-based nanoparticles, exosomes, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes [109][110][111]. \n\nIn the same way, various methods and routes of delivery have been investigated for their ability to enhance the efficiency of delivering nanoparticles to the brain and allowing them passage through the brain barriers.

            "text": "The BBB is a highly selective permeability barrier that separates the peripheral blood from CNS in order to maintain optimal levels of essential nutrients and neurotransmitters in the brain [9]. Together with the blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier, BBB plays a critical role in protecting the CNS against neurotoxins and regulating the homeostasis of the brain. However, it also limits the transport and delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs to the CNS. To overcome this challenge, we developed a new LPMSNPs-based drug delivery system with the goal of delivering antioxidants to combat oxidative stress in the brain tissue, which is thought to be associated with various neurological injuries and disorders. For MSNPs, drug loading efficiency and dissolution rate are heavily dependent on pore morphology, pore size and loading method [12]. For the present study, commercial MSNPs with particle size 200 nm and pore size 4 nm were chosen. MSNPs with a pore size ranging from 2 to 50 nm have been reported to be excellent candidates for drug delivery and biomedical applications [19]. Although some studies suggest nanoparticles with smaller size are easier to cross BBB, plenty of literatures exist showing successful crossing of BBB in vivo with particle size similar to or larger than 200 nm [20][21][22]. Additionally, particles with sizes between 120 and 200 nm can escape the reticuloendothelial system allowing longer retention time in the circulation for RSV to bypass the liver and spleen filtration, which would result in increased BBB contact and crossing [23]. \n\nHere, we showed that 16 \u03bcg RSV can be loaded into 1 mg of MSNPs after 3 days of physical adsorption, and the MSNPs rapidly release 90% of drug load after 5 days. Driven by the need for on-demand drug delivery, ROSresponsive materials have gained increasing interests [24,25].",

            "text": "Introduction and purpose: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of\u00a0 capillary endothelium, in which there are three types of intercellular junctions - adherent, tight and gap junctions.Efficient therapy involves delivering a therapeutic dose of drug into a specific site in the body, and maintaining this dose for adequate time afterwards. The aim of this study is to review current knowledge of new strategies in drug delivery to CNS and the effectiveness of these methods in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment. This review was performed using the PubMed database.\u00a0 A brief description of the state of knowledge: \u00a0Methods for delivering drugs to the brain are divided into invasive and non-invasive. Invasive methods involve temporary disrupting tight intercellular junctions of the vascular endothelial cells and delivering drugs intracerebrally or intraventricularly during neurosurgical procedures. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of nanoparticles as drug carriers to the central nervous system via blood-brain barrier. The usage of nanoparticles implies many advantages, such as non-invasive, low cost, good biodegradability, stability, ability to carry various types of agents, selectivity and ability to control drug release.\u00a0 Conclusions: Limited options in treating brain located tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, due to difficulties in drug penetration through the BBB engages scientists to search for new treatments. Crossing the BBB using invasive methods based on interruption of cell junctions show promising results, but they are associated with i.a. a high risk of uncontrolled influx of toxins to the CNS or \u00a0ion-electrolyte imbalance, which may lead to neuronal dysfunction. Invasive methods can be effective only in tumors, while treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease is impossible. Recent studies show that nanoparticles would be a great, non-invasive alternative, but they are difficult to use with relatively low permeability through undamaged BBB. In some studies using nanoparticles as nanocarriers\u00a0 (EDVDox) or SYMPHONY method (combining photothermal therapy with GNS and immunotherapy of checkpoints in a mouse model) against GBM shows positive results. More research is required to confirm the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology in drug delivery is categorized into two approaches: direct nanonization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or the drug itself, and encapsulation of the drug within nanocarriers. Utilizing the ultra-small scale of nanoparticles allows drugs to overcome physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and nasal transport barriers, offering novel administration routes. Nanocarriers, with their large surface area and ease of surface modification, can be attached with numerous functional groups, facilitating enhanced cellular entry and therapeutic efficacy, thus improving drug delivery efficiency. 91,92 or instance, nasal drug delivery systems utilizing materials such as liposomes and nanoemulsions, enhanced for mucosal penetration, can improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, significantly enhancing mucosal diffusion and absorption, 93 thereby making nasal delivery more efficient as demonstrated in Figure 3A. This innovation provides new pathways and therapeutic methods in clinical medicine.Direct nanonization of drugs typically involves passive diffusion and unsaturated transport primarily through the pores of capillary endothelial cells. In contrast, the application of nanocarriers primarily utilizes receptor-mediated transport and adsorption-mediated transport under electric charge, constituting saturated transport methods to breach the BBB. 94 For example, Sun et al 95 developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, Lu et al 96 found that cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles exhibited an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts, as depicted in Figure 3B.",

            "text": "Brain cancer is one of the common types of human cancers, which is known by being a fatal and non-curable disease with poor outcomes. There are various brain tumor treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. However, these therapies do not have a high survival rate due to drug resistance and the high protection advantage by the blood brain barrier (BBB). BBB is characterized by a very low permeability for biomolecules required to regulate metabolism of the brain due to the presence of tight junctions, efflux transporters, and low enzymatic activity. Although these properties protect the CNS from the bloodstream components, they also limit most effective drugs reaching the CNS, thereby raising challenges of finding drugs and drug delivery systems that can cross the BBB. Nanomedicine can provide fertile grounds for the development of passive and active drug delivery systems that can reach the brain. In nanomedicine, different types of organic and inorganic nanoparticles such as lipid, polymeric, micelles, and metallic nanoparticles could be used for diagnosis, and the delivery of anticancer agents to the brain. In this context, lipid nanoparticles are the most successful drug delivery systems, and are in clinical use due to properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and acceptable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties. Indeed, several studies provided proof-of-concept for the ability of lipid nanocarriers to cross the BBB in vivo, thereby confirming the important value of nanomedicine as a treatment strategy for brain cancer.\n\nDespite the potent applications of lipid nanocarriers to reach the brain through crossing the BBB, the strategies and protocols require careful optimization to reach an optimal therapeutic index. First, materials used in formulating lipid nanoparticles should be selected based on the high biocompatibility and low toxicity; thereby not harming normal tissues and the integrity of BBB. Second, lipid nanocarriers should be stable for enough time in the bloodstream to achieve the required task properly. Third, functionalizing the surface of lipid nanoparticles to cross the BBB and reach the brain should be investigated to limit accumulation of",

While the BBB serves as a crucial protective barrier, it poses challenges in delivering therapeutic agents to their intended targets within the brain parenchyma. To enhance drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, several delivery technologies to circumvent the BBB have been developed in the last few years. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most versatile and promising tools. Here, we summarize the characteristics of NPs that facilitate BBB penetration, including their size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and importantly, their conjugation with various biological or synthetic molecules such as glucose, transferrin, insulin, polyethylene glycol, peptides, and aptamers. Additionally, we discuss the coating of NPs with surfactants. A comprehensive overview of the common in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB for NP penetration studies is also provided. The discussion extends to discussing BBB impairment under pathological conditions and leveraging BBB alterations under pathological conditions to enhance drug delivery. Emphasizing the need for future studies to uncover the inherent therapeutic properties of NPs, the review advocates for their role beyond delivery systems and calls for efforts translating NPs to the clinic as therapeutics. Overall, NPs stand out as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for precise BBB targeting and drug delivery in neurological disorders.",

            "text": "Brain diseases are difficult to treat pharmacologically due to the existence of the BBB, which is a formidable barrier for drug delivery to brain. However, many aspects of the BBB evolve during the onset and progression of many brain diseases. Substantial proof-of-concept studies tested the combined use of BBB evolutions (e.g., BBB disruption and regulation of transport systems) and nanocarriers for selectively enhanced drug delivery to diseased brain regions for drug therapy of brain diseases. Although many BBB evolution-based brain-targeting strategies have shown significant efficiency, quantitative brain delivery efficiency data (e.g., percentage of dose/g-brain) on disease animal models are missing in some studies and remain to be further investigated. Some BBB evolutions haven't been tested for mediating brain drug delivery, e.g., increased integrin and adhesion molecules and leukocyte diapedesis in PD. Related studies are still in their infancy and thus need to be further extensively and intensively researched. There are still many issues remain to be solved, e.g., to accurately determine the transition time, the degree, the location and the heterogeneity of various BBB evolutions, and to reveal the connection of BBB evolutions with age and restoration after drug treatment. Real-time quantitative monitoring of various BBB evolutions will also be instructive to choose suitable BBB evolution-based BBB crossing strategies and braintargeting drug delivery systems and to optimize the therapeutic regimen, especially for personalized medicine. In addition, more thorough discovery and understanding of BBB evolutions will be beneficial for the formation of a drug delivery system with extremely high brain-targeting efficiency, which will be very promising for clinical translation. Cellular neurovascular unit models using patient-derived endothelial cells may contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of the BBB evolutions 199 . Such studies with improved BBB models will also help shed light on the cellular interactions and signaling that occur in pathophysiological conditions. Additional studies must be carried out to overcome the safety and toxicity issues against the use of Diseased BBB-based brain-targeting delivery strategies nanocarriers.",

Oral, skin, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, and intra-peritoneal routes are mainly used with various delivery vehicles. These vehicles must enhance the tolerance of immunomodulatory molecules against the harsh intra-organismal environment and advance their efficacy to overcome the brain-blood barrier. Synthetic polymers, such as poly lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), are easily synthesized and modified, capable of transferring sufficient amounts of immunotherapeutic molecules and facilitating their gradual release [18]. Permeability is decreased when electrically charged nanoparticles are used, such as orally administrated polyethylene imine-based nanoparticles and thiol-modified Eudragit polymers (polymethacrylates) [89,90]. Transgenic plant delivery is another technique that takes advantage of the protective effect of the plant cell wall, especially for delivery through the gastrointestinal tract [91,92]. Nanoemulsions, small colloidal particles, provide a high encapsulation efficiency [93], while phosphatidylserine-liposomes have been efficiently used to reduce EAE severity in mice [94]. Much attention has been paid to lipid-based nanocarriers, such as nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which are suggested to be efficient for brain targeting. NLCs have been reported to be very safe and stable, with a high encapsulation efficiency [95,96]. A major challenge in the field of immunotherapy treatment is the improvement of delivery methods so that immunotherapeutic molecules can be transferred more efficiently through the brain-blood barrier. This will improve the therapeutic efficiency, reduce side effects, and decrease the number of administration procedures.",

            "text": "The choice of the nanometre range for drug delivery loaded with Class II drugs is also linked to their ability to either cross biological barriers themselves, or to allow loaded drugs to cross them. This is a key factor for some specialised barriers, such as barriers between the blood and neural tissues, and in particular, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which are very difficult to cross by drugs because of their function for maintaining the homeostasis of the brain by regulating the chemical environment, immune cell transport, and entry of xenobiotics. The BBB represents the most important factor limiting the development of drugs for the central nervous system, and it is characterized by relatively impermeable endothelial cells with tight junctions, enzymatic activity, and active efflux transport systems. The tight junctions formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells regulate paracellular transport, whereas transcellular transport is regulated by specialised transporters, pumps, and receptors. Nanocarriers can open the tight junctions between endothelial cells, transcy-tosis through the endothelial cell layer, and endocytosis by endothelial cells, releasing the drug inside the cell. Furthermore, coating agents, such as polysorbates, inhibit the transmembrane efflux systems (i.e., P-glycoprotein). Various novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, microspheres, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, and inorganic systems, have been proposed to overcome the limitations imposed by the BBB [40].",

While many toxic agents can readily enter the central nervous system (CNS), the blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB) prevents the brain uptake of most pharmaceuticals. Consequently, poisoning antidotes usually cannot reach their site of action in the CNS in therapeutically relevant concentrations, and thus only provide effective protection to the peripheral nervous system. This limitation can be overcome by encapsulating the antidotes in nanoparticles (NP), which can enhance their CNS accumulation without damaging the integrity of the BBB. Among nanocarriers, polymer\u2010based drug delivery systems exhibit remarkable benefits, such as bioavailability, cell uptake and tissue retention. Furthermore, due to their capacity to mask unfavorable physicochemical properties of cargo drugs, polymeric NPs were able to improve BBB transport of various pharmaceuticals. However, while polymer NP\u2010mediated treatment of various pathological brain conditions, such as glioma and Alzheimer's disease were exhaustively studied, the application of polymeric nanocarriers for brain\u2010targeted delivery of antidote molecules has not been adequately examined. To display its therapeutic potential, we review the state of the art of polymer NP\u2010assisted CNS delivery of antidotes for various poisonings, including heavy metal and organophosphorus intoxications.",

The main problems with conventional drug therapies are: (i) poor selectivity; and (ii) difficulty in crossing biological barriers. Chemotherapy, for example, is still the main therapy against cancer; however, its poor selectivity causes several side effects. On the other hand, the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), which separates the blood from the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system (CNS), hinders drug delivery from the blood to the brain tissue. In recent years, new drug delivery systems are being explored to overcome these challenges. Extracellular vesicles possess several characteristics that make them suitable as drug delivery systems, such as the ability to cross biological barriers, the stability in the circulatory system, and safety; indeed, several studies investigated the possibility to use them as new drug nanocarriers [61,62]. However, some limitations to the use of EVs as drug delivery vehicles still exist as the development of a scalable and reproducible EV isolation method and the immune response that its administration may trigger. \n\nPDEVs represent a promising model for drug delivery, as they are natural products that possess several advantageous properties including safety, non-toxicity, low immunogenicity. Moreover, PDEVs can be produced on large scale and several studies have demonstrated that they are stable and resistant in the stomach-and intestinal-like solutions [10,13,32,48]; they have been found, after oral gavage, in intestinal stem cells, liver, colon, and dendritic cells as well as in the intestinal macrophages of mice",

            "text": "The advent of nanomedicine has brought nanoparticles that provide unique ways to control interactions with cells and tissues. However, when facing the complexity of in vivo systems, nanoparticles are not simply required to interact with one singular cell type, but rather with several cellular environments with distinctive characteristics before reaching the intended target site. For disorders in the NVU, reaching the diseased site is even more complex, as the CNS is well-guarded by its own immune system and a specialized endothelial barrier. The treatment and diagnosis of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and brain cancers becomes challenging, as most molecules cannot reach the brain at therapeutically relevant doses. Nanocarriers pose as an auspicious concept for improving the delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. However, systemically administrated nanocarriers that target the brain must also overcome the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) and be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly selective structure [1,2]. Crossing the BBB generally implies that the nanoparticles (NPs) should be internalized by endothelial cells and subsequently exocytosed into the brain (Figure 1). Furthermore, after reaching the brain, the nanocarriers need to get to the different brain areas for effective therapeutic delivery. To obtain systems with the most favorable results, understanding and tuning of nanocarriers properties is essential. The brain capillaries irrigate the brain parenchyma, and their structure is composed of specialized endothelial cells as well as pericytes and astrocytes. The endothelial cells display apical-basal polarity, and tight junctions separate the polarized membranes. To reach the brain, NPs will need to interact with the apical membrane, be internalized by the endothelium, and undergo vesicular trafficking and exocytosis. \n\nThe highly versatile nature of polymers offers exceptional opportunities to carefully modulate NP properties.",

            "text": "Compared to local delivery, systemic drug delivery offers greater flexibility and controllability in terms of timing and dosage. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)/blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) may pose challenges to drug delivery efficiency. Additionally, physiological conditions within the body can affect drug stability and efficacy. Therefore, it is crucial to consider transporting active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to target tissues and enhance their targeting specificity. Nanomaterials exhibit several unique advantages in neuroprotection [116] (sees in Fig. 4 and Table 3): (i) the ability to overcome barriers such as the blood-brain barrier/blood-spinal cord barrier; (ii) the advantage of retaining drug activity; and (iii) the potential for further enhancing targeting capabilities through coupling modifications [117][118][119]. Nanoparticles have been widely employed in systemic drug delivery for spinal cord injury, although they are also used locally at injury sites for slow and sustained drug release or to improve the microenvironment [120][121][122]. Here, we primarily review systemic delivery strategies involving nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs. \n\nOverall, current strategies to enhance targeting in the field of SCI include: (i) reactive oxygen species (ROS) response; (ii) pH response (acidic environment at the injury site [46]); (iii) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) response [19,123]; (iv) chemotactic factor response; and (v) other specific environmental cues. Inorganic materials such as metal and metal oxide-doped nanoparticles have widely and effectively application. Most of them naturally possess antioxidative properties and exhibit excellent ROS-responsive capabilities, although Fig. 4. Types and modification of nanoparticles used for systemic delivery in spinal cord injury: Based on complex and adverse microenvironment post injury, 4 modification strategies were used for constructing environment specific response scaffold, including (i) coating with peptide, (ii) coupling to form environment response bonds, (iii) designing in different types to load drugs and (iv) coating with cell membranes. they initially predominantly accumulate at the injury site through penetrating the BSCB.",

            "text": "Discovering new methods to treat diseases is becoming increasingly complicated because of the numerous natural biological barriers in our bodies such as opsonization by proteins in the blood, first-pass clearance organs, and the immune response [1,2]. The difficulty of overcoming these barriers to create a cure is exponentially increased when trying to deliver pharmaceutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [3,4]. This is due to the brains increased security including tight junctions, low molecule diffusion rates, efflux transporters, and difficulty in reaching sufficient drug exposure in the brain compartment [5]. Nanomedicine has been the leading field in surpassing these barriers to deliver drugs to the brain. This is because their physico-chemical characteristics can be controlled to improve drug solubility, compatibility in BBB interactions, and can be targeted using ligands specific to improve delivery into the brain [6][7][8]. \n\nA very promising targeting ligand for the delivery of nanomedicines into the brain is Angiopep-2 (Ang-2), a 19 amino acid peptide (TFFYGGSRGKRNNFKTEEY-OH) which binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) (by endothelial cells on the basolateral surface, neuroblasts, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons) [9][10][11][12]. This ligand has been highly sought after in its use to deliver nanomedicines to the brain because of its ability to activate transcytosis across the BBB, as well as its upregulation in human glioma cells [13][14][15]. To this end, Ang-2 has been conjugated to numerous nanocarrier types in order to improve BBB crossing, including liposomes, tandem micelles, PEG-PCL, solid lipid nanoparticles, dendrigraft poly-l lysine, and poly-amidoamine dendrimers to deliver various active compounds (Coumarin, docetaxel, siRNA, etc.) [16][17][18][19].",

            "text": "The targeting of nanocarriers is outlined in more detail in Section 4.3. \n\nIn some areas of the brain, the endothelium is fenestrated and nanoparticles can cross the endothelium by the paracellular route. These areas, lacking a conventional bloodbrain barrier, are located near ventricles (circumventricular organs); they occur in areas of the CNS that respond to substances in the blood. Larger serum proteins and small nanoparticles pass the endothelial barrier in these regions although they may be blocked at the glial barrier. The choroid plexus is one example of an area lacking an endothelial barrier, but in this case, a barrier with tight junctions is present on the choroid plexus epithelium. Even if nanoparticles reach the cerebrospinal fluid, they still cannot directly access the brain parenchyma because of the ependymal/glial barrier. Only a tiny proportion of drugs injected into the blood or ventricles normally reaches the brain parenchyma; for this reason, it is essential when quantitating transport to verify exactly where in the brain the drug/treatment is located [19]. In summary, the treatment of CNS diseases by gene therapy with oligonucle has great potential, but gene delivery is the limiting factor. This is particularly tru nanocarrier must cross the blood-brain barrier to provide widespread distribution CNS. Considerable progress has been made with the delivery of smaller thera agents to the CNS by encapsulation within nanoparticles [20], but any type of gen apy adds an additional problem because the oligonucleotides must subsequent transfect the target cells.",

            "text": "Glioma is considered as one of the most aggressive and lethal types of cancers. The clinical therapeutic effect of glioma by drug treatment is very unsatisfying because of the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which restricts the distribution of drugs from blood to brain (Pardridge, 1999). Moreover, the non-targeted nature of drugs often causes severe side effects because they produce a similar cytotoxicity in both cancerous and healthy cell. Given the intrinsic difficulty for most conventional drugs to reach the brain, the use of nanocarriers has been suggested as an innovative therapeutic strategy (Kreuter, 2001). Over the past few decades, various types of nanocarriers such as liposomes, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polymeric particles have been fabricated from various materials (Shaw et al., 2017). In recent years, to overcome the BBB barrier and specifically deliver drugs to brain tumor, dual targeting delivery strategy have been extensively explored (Gao, et al., 2013;Gao, 2016;2017), which are functionalized with two active targeting ligands: one to the BBB and the other to the brain tumor. There are many targeting ligands that have been deeply studied, including TGN peptide, AS1411 aptamer (Gao et al., 2012), interleukin-13 peptide, RGD (Gao et al., 2014), angiopep-2 (Ruan et al., 2015), Ala-Ala-Asn-Cys-Asp (AK) peptide (Ruan et al., 2017), and so on. Nanocarriers have several advantages in drug delivery: high payload of drugs, prolonging blood circulation time, targeting specific cells, and enhancement of endocytosis (Qu et al., 2016). However, issues related to their synthetic materials (e.g. porous hollow silica or not fully biocompatible polymers) can limit their effects and cause toxicology problems (Nativo et al., 2008;Guerrero-C azares et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Considerable progress has been made for miRNA manipulation. However, a successful miRNA-based therapeutic must include an effective and safe delivery system, which has become the most challenging barrier for translation into clinical practice. In GBM, the challenge is even greater as the existence of the BBB, a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain vessels that is a natural barrier designed to shield the brain from exposure to potentially harmful macromolecules in the blood. In the previous proof-of-principle studies, utilization of viral vehicles carrying the expressing cassettes or non-viral vehicles (the most frequently used one is the liposome) encapsulating oligonucleotides has demonstrated effectiveness and tolerated cytotoxicity in vitro, triggering great interest for clinical translation. But with respect to the viral delivery system, the enthusiasm is ebbing in treating brain tumors. Because without compromising the BBB integrity, viral carriers are not able to permeate the brain vessels to reach the tumor cells, and prior to their delivery efficiency, the potential for immunostimulation and mutagenesis in humans are more concerning in clinical applications. The demand for a localized intrathecal or intratumoral injection and the safety concerns are formidable for starting a miRNA-targeting trial especially when no precedent has been shown to work. On the contrary, non-viral delivery strategies are capturing the imagination with oligonucleotide and small molecule delivery, triggered by the cumulative interest in intravenous administration of siRNAs and cytotoxic drug formulations. Nanocarriers, which commonly refer to submicron-sized particles ranging from 1 to 1000 nm and carrying therapeutic cargos, are the most studied strategies of the non-viral drug delivery systems. Due to their advantageous properties, including a small size, customizable surface, and improved solubility, the nanoparticles have long been recognized as effective vehicles to penetrate the BBB [115]. In addition to liposomal nanoparticles, currently available nanocarriers can also be fabricated from a variety of synthetic materials, including polymers, amphiphilic star copolymers, dendrimers and inorganics.",

            "text": "GBMs are the most frequent brain tumors and are characterized by a very poor prognosis. Typical survival after diagnosis is approximately 14.6 months, and only 20-25% of patients show improvement in 2-year survival with approved treatments [1,2]. Attempts to extend the median survival with central nervous system (CNS) drugs have been limited by the complexity of the brain, particularly the difficulty of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [1,3]. The BBB is a major barrier to drug delivery in most brain tumors [4][5][6][7]. As the tumor progresses, the BBB is referred to as the blood-tumor barrier (BTB), which differs from the BBB in that it is damaged and new blood vessels are formed. In GBM, the permeability of the BTB is high in the bulk of the tumor, but there is very little permeability in the periphery [2]. Accordingly, a GBM cell-specific target-binding strategy may be required for drug delivery across the BTB. \n\nChemotherapeutic drugs, such as temozolomide (TMZ), paclitaxel (PTX), and doxorubicin (Dox), are used for the treatment of glioblastoma, but these drugs have limitations such as low solubility, stability, and nonpenetration [8,9]. Nanoparticles are a promising solution due to the improvement of drug delivery efficiency and a reduction in side effects [10][11][12]. Dox exerts anti-tumor activity through inhibiting DNA replication, transcription, and repair through intercalation into DNA base pairs, blocking these processes [13,14]. As such, Dox was selected as a drug due to its ability to act as a carrier and insert into the DNA strand. Nanopharmaceutical research has been continuously reported in cancer treatment applications, and numerous nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems have been considered, including the development of specific tumor-targeted drug delivery systems [15][16][17][18][19][20].",

            "text": "PDA can be easily functionalized to improve cellular uptake, blood circulation, and drug loading. Understanding the connections between PDA nanosystems' properties and drug delivery mechanisms is pivotal for designing new nanocarriers tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive understanding enables the creation of drug delivery systems that offer better control over drug release and improved patient outcomes [122]. \n\nThe advancements in PDA-based drug delivery systems, including controlled and stimuli-responsive drug release, improved drug loading, and enhanced biocompatibility, contribute to better drug release kinetics and patient compliance compared to the existing delivery systems. These systems offer targeted, sustained, and efficient drug delivery, mini-mizing side effects and reducing dosing frequency, thereby improving patient adherence to treatment protocols. \n\nA new advancement is the development of glucose-polydopamine-coated nanoparticles designed to facilitate the efficient crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This specialized coating significantly boosts the targeting and transcytosis capabilities of nanoparticles in brain capillary endothelial cells, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic agents directly to brain tissue. Demonstrated in an orthotopic glioblastoma model, these nanoparticles showed high brain tissue uptake, marking a major step forward in potentially transforming treatments for neurological conditions and brain tumors [123]. \n\nIn dermatology, the application of polydopamine coatings on nonporous and mesoporous nanoparticles has been extensively studied for skin drug delivery. Research comparing these two nanoparticle types revealed that mesoporous nanoparticles, with their structured void spaces, exhibit superior drug loading capacity, effective radical scavenging abilities, and enhanced penetration into deeper skin layers. This enhanced performance is crucial for delivering therapeutic agents more effectively within the skin, promising advancements in treatments for various skin conditions and enhancing cosmetic formulations [124]. \n\nThe versatility of polydopamine coatings extends to vascular health, where they have been used to immobilize gene complex nanoparticles on substrates to promote endothelial cell proliferation over smooth muscle cells. This application is particularly significant in vascular implants, where localized delivery of growth factor-encoding genes can improve implant functionality and integration.",

Nanodrug delivery systems have emerged as promising tools for effectively crossing this barrier. Additionally, the development of smart nanoparticles brings new hope for cancer diagnosis and treatment. These nanoparticles improve drug delivery efficiency, allowing for the creation of targeted and stimuli-responsive delivery methods.

            "text": "From several perspectives the brain is a challenging organ for drug delivery. First, the incidence of degenerative diseases in the brain will increase with the aging population. Secondly, the blood brain barrier (BBB) is well-known as the best gatekeeper in the body toward exogenous substances (review Pardridge 2007). Generally pharmaceuticals including most small molecules do not cross the BBB. The endothelial barrier is specifi cally tight at the interface with the brain astrocytes and can in normal conditions only be passed using endogeneous BBB transporters resulting in carrier mediated transport, active effl ux transport and/or receptor mediated transport. However the barrier properties may be compromised intentionally or unintentionally by drug treatment allowing passage of nanoparticles (Olivier et al 1999;Kreuter et al 2003;Lockman et al 2003;Koziara et al 2006). The delivery of drugs by nanocarrier was recently reviewed (Koziara et al 2006;Tiwari and Amiji 2006). \n\nPassage of the BBB was suggested to be possible by the toxic effect of nanoparticles (about 200 nm) on cerebral endothelial cells (Olivier et al 1999), although for similar nanoparticles (about 300 nm) this was contradicted in another study (Kreuter et al 2003). In addition this effect was not found for a different type of nanoparticles (Lockman et al 2003). Physical association of the drug to the nanoparticles was necessary for drug delivery to occur into the brain (Kreuter et al 2003). When nanoparticles with different surface characteristics were evaluated, neutral nanoparticles and low concentrations of anionic nanoparticles were found to have no effect on BBB integrity, whereas high concentrations of anionic nanoparticles and cationic nanoparticles were toxic for the BBB. The extent of brain uptake of anionic nanoparticles at lower concentrations was superior to neutral or cationic formulations at the same concentrations. \n\nSo, nanoparticle surface charges must be considered for toxicity and brain distribution profi les (Lockman et al 2004).",

These encouraging results confirmed the possibility of developing a novel non-invasive nose to brain delivery system of OXC for the treatment of epilepsy [88]. To evidence direct transport of molecules after IN administration it is relevant to calculate two important parameters: drug targeting efficiency (DTE%), which represents the time average partitioning ratio (Equation ( 1)), and direct nose-to-brain transport percentage (DTP%) (Equation ( 2)): \n\nwhere B IN is the AUC max (brain) following IN administration, B X is the brain AUC fraction contributed by systemic circulation through the BBB following IN administration, B IV is the AUC max (brain) following IV administration, P IV is AUC max (blood) following IV administration, and P IN is AUC max (blood) following IN instillation. These parameters were used by El-Zaafarany as proof of concept to evaluate brain targeting efficiency of OXC loaded nano-tryglycerid carrier defined emulsomal vesicles and, recently, OXC loaded emulsome-loaded poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA, triblock polymer) thermogel solutions [89,90]. In El-Zaafarany's work, emulsomes were prepared as nanocarriers because of their particular morphology. Emulsomes showed a lipid core in both the solid and the liquid crystalline state at 25 \u2022 C, coated with a phospholipid bilayer. These nanocarriers combining the characteristics of lipid spheres (apolar core) and liposomes (hydrophilic surface) useful for lipophilic incorporation, encapsulation of emulsomes into thermoresponsive gel have been studied to improve the interesting results obtained in 2016.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notorious for its poor prognosis due to the high recurrence rate, even after surgical resection [1,2]. The highly infiltrative nature of GBM cells makes them difficult to completely remove by incision surgery without damaging normal brain tissue [3,4]. Consequently, adjuvant therapies including radiotherapy and chemotherapy are also administered as standard postoperative treatment; however, their therapeutic efficacy is limited by the inherent features of GBM [5,6]. Radiotherapy is hindered by radiation tolerance induced by genetic heterogeneity and frequent mutation of GBM cells [7,8]. Additionally, chemothera-py (e.g., oral administration of temozolomide) is impeded by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which lowers the efficiency of systemic drug delivery to GBM cells [9]. \n\nHowever, the systemic administration of drugs is still preferred among treatment options for GBM, as this method is easily accessible and less burdensome to patients [10]. Therefore, systemic drug delivery strategies to penetrate the BBB and increase delivery efficiency have been developed [11]. For example, nanoparticles with modified ligands capable of crossing the BBB have been suggested [12][13][14]. In addition, temporal opening of the BBB using external stimuli such as ultrasound has been studied to promote systemic drug delivery efficiency [15,16]. Although many studies have successfully improved systemic drug delivery efficiency, they are still insufficient to completely cure GBM. Systemic drug delivery strategies exhibit clear limitations as their long delivery routes induce a high probability of drug absorption by other organs, or drug clearance during blood circulation. Additionally, the risk of systemic toxicity remains a concern [17,18]. \n\nThus, local drug delivery methods that directly administer drugs to the brain have been proposed as promising solutions. The local delivery approach can dramatically enhance delivery efficiency by bypassing the BBB. Various types of local drug delivery strategies, such as intracranial delivery [19,20], convection-enhanced delivery (CED) [21,22], and intracranial implant-based delivery [23,24], have been developed [10,25].",

After crossing the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles can bind monomers and oligomers of A\u03b2 so, specific inhibition of neurotoxicants can help to ameliorate AD. Surface functionalization or chemical modification of these nanocarriers may improve the aqueous solubility, and therefore, facilitating their utilization to treat the neurodegenerative disorders.

            "text": "Nanotechnology has brought a variety of new possibilities into biological discovery and clinical practice. In particular, nano-scaled carriers have revolutionalized drug delivery, allowing for therapeutic agents to be selectively targeted on an organ, tissue and cell specific level, also minimizing exposure of healthy tissue to drugs. In this review we discuss and analyze three issues, which are considered to be at the core of nano-scaled drug delivery systems, namely functionalization of nanocarriers, delivery to target organs and in vivo imaging. The latest developments on highly specific conjugation strategies that are used to attach biomolecules to the surface of nanoparticles (NP) are first reviewed. Besides drug carrying capabilities, the functionalization of nanocarriers also facilitate their transport to primary target organs. We highlight the leading advantage of nanocarriers, i.e. their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain that prevents high-molecular weight molecules from entering the brain. The BBB has several transport molecules such as growth factors, insulin and transferrin that can potentially increase the efficiency and kinetics of brain-targeting nanocarriers. Potential treatments for common neurological disorders, such as stroke, tumours and Alzheimer's, are therefore a much sought-after application of nanomedicine. Likewise any other drug delivery system, a number of parameters need to be registered once functionalized NPs are administered, for instance their efficiency in organ-selective targeting, bioaccumulation and excretion. Finally, direct in vivo imaging of nanomaterials is an exciting recent field that can provide real-time tracking of those nanocarriers. We review a range of systems suitable for in vivo imaging and monitoring of drug delivery, with an emphasis on most recently introduced molecular imaging modalities based on optical and hybrid contrast, such as fluorescent protein tomography and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Overall, great potential is foreseen for nanocarriers in medical diagnostics, therapeutics and molecular targeting. A proposed roadmap for ongoing and future research directions is therefore discussed in detail with emphasis on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging of nano-based drug delivery systems, a cutting-edge technology poised to",

            "text": "The ability of therapeutic agents to reach their target sites in the central nervous system (CNS) is very limited due to the strong protective function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 20% of all humans suffer from CNS disorders such as depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, cerebral cancer, or CNS-relevant metabolic diseases. According to recent estimates, the number of people suffering from CNS diseases worldwide will increase significantly in coming decades due to tremendous population growth, increasing life expectancy and in addition, due to risk factors such as obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Therefore, the development of highly efficient, safe, and targeted pharmaceutical systems that are able to overcome the BBB is urgently needed in order to exert therapeutic effects in disease-specific regions of the brain. Macromolecular drugs, such as proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids, bear a very high potential to open up new perspectives for the treatment of CNS diseases. Less than 2% of small molecule drugs are able to cross the barrier to reach their target sides in the CNS [1]. When it comes to macromolecular drugs, the barrier is completely impermeable due to their high molecular weight [2]. For an extensive review covering transport routes across the BBB, the reader is referred to [3]. \n\nA wide range of macromolecular drugs is embedded into nanocarriers to make them stable, safe, and efficient drugs after administration into the human body. In an effort to design efficient nanocarriers that can enable controlled and targeted drug delivery into the brain, a promising option is to decorate the nanocarriers with ligands that can interact with specific binding sites of the BBB with subsequent internalization of the particles via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) into the brain. Among the numerous potential targets at the BBB, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family has been extensively investigated as highly efficient target for brain delivery in several studies using liposomes [4] or polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) [3] as drug carriers.",

Hence, owing to the capacity to modulate their interactions with endothelial Pharmaceutics 2019, 11, 101 3 of 23 cells in the brain through surface functionalization, various nanocarriers have been employed [25]. Therefore, the encapsulation of therapeutic and imaging agents into specific nanocarriers might overcome the challenges associated with the conventional delivery methods across the BBB [26]. Additionally, after intravenous administration, nanocarriers are capable of crossing the tissues in the organism and reach the central nervous system [27]. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages associated with each nanocarrier type, as well as the surface functionalization strategies is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the specific pathways to cross the BBB for each nanocarrier is presented in Figure 2.  Polymeric nanoparticles used as nanocarriers involve matrix architectures, most commonly in the form of nanocapsules and nanospheres [28,29]. The most widely used polymers for manufacturing these nanocarriers are biocompatible and biodegradable and of synthetic origin, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactide-co-polyglycolic acid, poly(\u03b5-caprolactone), and polymethyl methacrylate, and of natural origin, such as chitosan, alginate, gelatin, and albumin [28,30]. The pharmacokinetics of the encapsulated agents is mainly influenced by the structure of the polymer and the entrapping method [31]. \n\nThe mechanisms for brain uptake and drug release of polymeric nanoparticles have been intensively studied in order to design nanocarriers that can efficiently deliver therapeutics to the central nervous system through systemic and local administration.",

            "title": "Cell Membrane-Derived Nanovehicles for Targeted Therapy of Ischemic Stroke: From Construction to Application",
            "text": "Ischemic stroke (IS), characterized by the obstruction of cerebral blood vessels, results in reduced blood flow, insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply, and subsequent neuronal death [1], and is the most prevalent type of stroke and a leading cause of mortality and disability [2,3]. Current treatment approaches for IS include thrombolytic therapy, mechanical thrombectomy, pharmacological interventions, and rehabilitation [4,5]. However, most of these treatments have a limited therapeutic window and are only effective for a small number of patients. Neuroprotection and neurorecovery interventions are crucial for salvaging the ischemic penumbra in patients in whom the optimal treatment window has been missed. Unfortunately, the clinical application of neuroprotective drugs is hindered by their poor bioavailability due to their limited diffusion through the blood-brain barrier [6]. \n\nNano delivery systems are based on nanotechnology and offer distinct advantages in the treatment of IS [7]. These systems enable precise delivery of drugs to the brain by controlling drug release rates and targeting specific sites, thereby reducing drug dosage and minimizing side effects. Furthermore, nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach cerebral tissues, allowing for direct drug action in the affected area and enhancing therapeutic efficacy [8][9][10][11]. Various nanoplatforms, including liposomes, micelles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanogels, and inorganic nanomaterials, have shown promising potential in the treatment of IS [10,12,13]. However, the application of these nanocarriers is limited by factors such as poor targeting, drug leakage, inadequate stability and biocompatibility, as well as a short blood circulation time [14]. These factors contribute to reduced drug delivery efficiency and poor therapeutic effectiveness [15]. Therefore, there is a significant value in exploring the development of novel nano delivery systems that deviate from traditional approaches. \n\nAmong nanoplatforms, cell membrane-derived nanovehicles (CMNVs) have emerged as highly promising drug delivery systems [16,17].",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Canavan disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and those associated with the neoplastic process in astrocytic series cells, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are a major problem in modern medicine [1,2].The reason for this is that the current medicinal substances used for treatment show relatively low efficacy due to their high molecular weight, poor ability to target a specific cell type and difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [3][4][5].The problem of permeability across the biological barrier is a result of several features.The first is the existence of highly functional tight junctions between CNS endothelial cells, which prevent free paracellular passage from the circulatory system to the brain [6][7][8][9].Since the BBB is highly selective, its additional feature is the presence of transporters on the surface of CNS endothelial cells [8,10].In addition, CNS endothelial cells exhibit an extremely low rate of transcytosis, which contributes significantly to limiting transport through the vessel wall [10].Nevertheless, some macromolecules, such as insulin, albumin, low-density lipoproteins, and iron-bound transferrin, have the ability to penetrate the brain via transcytosis [11].This can be either receptor mediated or adsorption mediated [11,12].\n\nThe effectiveness of the delivery of medicinal substances to the CNS therefore depends on the size of the molecule, which should be below 200 nm, and the lipophilicity, polarity, and charge for optimal transport across the BBB [13].Lipophilic molecules show better BBB penetration capabilities, while hydrophilic drugs require specific transport strategies [14][15][16][17].Currently used drugs often have difficulty maintaining the aforementioned properties, contributing to the low efficiency of therapy [18].",

In addition, the use of mucoadhesive excipients 74,75 that prolong the residence time of the nanoformulation in the nasal mucosa have been shown to increase absorption, nose-tobrain transport and CNS bioavailability 76,77 . \n\nMore than 98% of the small-molecule and macromolecular drugs and new neurotherapeutics under preclinical and clinical investigation fail in crossing the BBB from the systemic circulation and show poor biopharmaceutical and PK properties 8,78 . The presence of efflux mechanisms such as those of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family contribute to reduce the drug bioavailability at the CNS 79 . This, together with peripheral accumulation and potential side effects following systemic administration, and the need to ensure high CNS bioavailability, call for novel therapeutic strategies. Nanodrug delivery systems administered by various routes have been proposed to bypass the activity of ABCs at the BBB level 80 . In this conceptual framework, their i.n. administration for local drug delivery to the brain in neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders, is very promising because small size and high surface area make nanocarriers radically more efficient than other classical technologies to surpasss this dynamic barrier and to release the cargo in the target organ, the brain. \n\nAs described above, the complex transport mechanisms from the nasal mucosa to the brain are not fully understood yet and most probably, they differ for drug solutions and particulate formulations of different particle size, shape, surface chemistry and charge, and flexibility. The maximum NP size to enable nose-tobrain transport was initially set at w100 nm, though particles as large as 300 nm were also succesfully delivered to the brain 81 . These divergent results highlight that a more comprehensive investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms and the NP features that govern the transport is critical to reach the clinical stage and increase translation into pharmaceutical products 82 . Moreover, the lessons learned from i.n.",

            "text": "As exemplified in another research field, possible approaches could be fusing the drug to the ligand [93] or packing it into nanoparticles coated with ligands that bind the overexpressed cell surface receptor [94]. Delivery systems could be exogenous vectors, including viral vectors, liposomes, or lipid nanoparticles, or endogenous vectors, such as exosomes [95]. Second, efficient cellular uptake is also essential. In brain cells, this step is particularly challenging, due to the reduced permeability of the blood-brain barrier, which is an obstacle to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, the blood-brain barrier contains transporters for peptides and proteins, which could be exploited for drug delivery strategies. The drug delivery vector could be modified with monoclonal antibodies mimicking substrates of these transporters, which might facilitate their crossing of the blood-brain barrier and delivery into the central nervous system [96]. Third, cellular uptake of exogenous compounds frequently occurs through endocytosis. The therapeutic compound needs to escape the endosomes and reach the required subcellular location. If endosomal escape is inefficient, the drug may be degraded inside the lysosomes, limiting its therapeutic potential. While regular transfection usually overcomes this limitation, the use of tailored vectors for delivery into a specific cell type may require its re-assessment. Fourth, RNA is intrinsically unstable. Furthermore, the hydrophilic nature and negative charge of oligonucleotides are obstacles to their membrane diffusion. To overcome these limitations, chemical modifications are effective in increasing RNA stability and membrane permeability. As such, all licensed RNA-based therapies utilize chemically modified RNA [97]. Fifth, any potential immunogenicity of the drug or its delivery system should also be tested. An immune response would cause degradation of the drug and a lack of therapeutic effect, with potential inflammatory responses. For example, single-stranded RNA molecules are usually more immunogenic than doublestranded RNA. Consequently, all siRNA-based therapies use double-stranded RNA [97]. Furthermore, the repeated administration of a lncRNA regulation therapy could also trigger an immune response, which would limit its use against chronic diseases.",

            "text": "It may be possible to postpone or even reverse many brain illnesses and age-related declines in brain function [65]. \n\nWhen primary tumors or metastases develop in unhealthy circumstances, the BBB is physically and functionally impaired beyond 1-2 mm in diameter, during this stage it becomes the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The deficiency of fenestration, the tight connections between endothelial cells (ECs), and the lower incidence of pinocytosis all restrict molecular exchange across the BBB, limiting transcellular transit [66]. Curcumin's limited penetration through the BBB and its chemical-physical properties provide significant constraints for using these novel systems in brain diseases. The BBB between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS) has the physiological function of maintaining ionic homeostasis and chemical exchange, thereby shielding the CNS from infections and circulating toxins and sustaining the brain microenvironment [67]. The structure, function, and permeability of the BBB changed in brain cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). Even though various methods for crossing the BBB have been developed, significant issues still make brain drug delivery problematic. The use of customized nanocarriers to preserve drugs while allowing them to pass across the BBB appears to be a successful approach [68]. \n\nThe first stage of endocytosis determines the ultimate passage of nanoparticles into endothelial cells via transcytosis. The endothelial cells' outer membrane influences the nanoparticles' entrance; in fact, positively charged nanoparticles employ the adsorbing transcytosis route more readily than neutral or negatively charged nanoparticles, which have more negligible protein adsorption and thus longer circulation durations. Because of improper tight junctions, nanoparticles can penetrate the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), and extended permeability and retention (EPR) [68]. \n\nEndothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and astrocytes occupy the BBB, and their end feet cover the basal lamina of the brain capillaries.",

            "text": "The management of brain diseases remains a challenge, particularly because of the difficulty for drugs to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Among strategies developed to improve drug delivery, nano-sized emulsions (i.e., nanoemulsions), employed as nanocarriers, have been described. Moreover, focused ultrasound-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption using microbubbles is an attractive method to overcome this barrier, showing promising results in clinical trials. Therefore, nanoemulsions combined with this technology represent a real opportunity to bypass the constraints imposed by the blood\u2013brain barrier and improve the treatment of brain diseases. In this work, a stable freeze-dried emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide nanodroplets stabilized with home-made fluorinated surfactants able to carry hydrophobic agents is developed. This formulation is biocompatible and droplets composing the emulsion are internalized in multiple cell lines. After intravenous administration in mice, droplets are eliminated from the bloodstream in 24 h (blood half-life (t1/2) = 3.11 h) and no long-term toxicity is expected since they are completely excreted from mice\u2019 bodies after 72 h. In addition, intracerebral accumulation of tagged droplets is safely and significantly increased after focused ultrasound-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Thus, the proposed nanoemulsion appears as a promising nanocarrier for a successful focused ultrasound-mediated brain delivery of hydrophobic agents.",

            "text": "Despite enormous progress in the field of bionanomaterials for drug delivery applications, there is limited success in designing nanocarriers that could effectively deliver therapeutic cargo molecules and imaging modalities to the intact brain. This is attributed to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that plays a major role in protecting the central nervous system from toxins and pathogens.\n\nThe unique selectivity of the BBB also limits the delivery of therapeutic drug molecules and thereby curtails our ability to treat malignancies such as neurological disorders after early diagnosis. [1] As a result, several promising drugs fail to achieve therapeutic efficacy and therefore neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, etc. remain difficult to treat. Discovering new biomimetic pathways that can deliver drug payloads and imaging modalities efficiently through the BBB and to targets in the brain is therefore of paramount importance. [2,3] Currently, the delivery of therapeutic molecules across BBB can be characterized into three major pathways. The first strategy involves the binding of drug molecules, nanoparticles (NPs), or surfactants to serum proteins, such as albumin or ApoE, that interact with the BBB receptors or transporters to allow entry to the brain parenchyma. For example, poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-derived nanoparticles [4] and surfactant polysorbate 80 (or tween 80) PLGA nanoparticles invade BBB by binding to ApoE after infusion in the blood. [5] The second strategy involves receptor targeting transcytosis where a ligand is installed on the NP surface to interact directly with the BBB receptors, such as the transferrin receptor, [6,7] glucose receptor, [8] integrin receptor, [9][10][11] or by conjugating NPs with cell-penetrating peptides. [12] The third strategy for paracellular delivery of drugs across BBB involves transient fenestration of the BBB's endothelium using small molecules such as mannitol [13] or recombinant proteins, such as human vascular endothelial growth factor [14] or targeting tight junction",

            "text": "Avoiding the BBB can be achieved through alternate means of administration which involve exposure of brain matter through surgical procedures or through pump/catheter administration in the target area-these methods have shown limited efficiency [22]. Recent studies on nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery systems attained improved release kinetics, chemical and physical stability when silica mesoporous materials were compared to conventional encapsulated drugs [23] and associate less peri-administration risk when compared to delivery techniques such as intracerebroventricular, intracerebral or intrathecal administration [24]. This is achieved through receptor mediated transport, by binding to target proteins on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and internalization of endothelial cells-the so-called transcellular pathway for lipophilic agents [14,25]. On the other hand, the paracellular pathways allows for transportation of hydrophilic molecules [25]. \n\nUpon administration into bloodstream, functionalized NPs adsorb apolipoprotein E or A1 [26] and polysorbate-80 (PS) coating provides an advantage by mimicking the biological actions of low-density lipoproteins [27]. The size of the particles below 100 nm represents a key feature, allowing for receptor-mediated endocytosis at the level of the capillary endothelial cell and release into brain parenchyma, the coupled therapeutic agent thus being able to penetrate the BBB and reach its target [28,29]. \n\nCalcium-dopped nanocarriers own the property of masquerading of the transporter, resulting in a decreased uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and prolonged levels of the drug in the bloodstream-creating a steadier concentration gradient that provides increased chances of permeating the BBB [30]. \n\nNPs with positive charge cross the BBB through adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [31], governed by electrostatic interactions between the cationic groups belonging to the ligands on the NPs' surface and the negative charges of the luminal pole of the endothelial cells [31,32].",

            "text": "Pharmaceutical nanotechnology enables novel approaches to drug delivery [77]. One promising approach is NPs as carriers for drug transport. NPs allow overcoming pharmacological limitations such as low solubility, rapid biodegradation, low bioavailability, adverse effects, and low permeability through biological barriers [78]. The main challenges in developing a formulation to treat PD include an efficient crossing of the drug through the BBB and controlled drug release to avoid fluctuations in concentration. The BBB has the function of protecting the CNS, restricting the entry of harmful xenobiotics, regulating the passage of endogenous molecules, and limiting therapeutic agents' entry [79,80]. Because PD therapies are generally chronic, taking medications by mouth is a comfortable and safe option for patients; however, studies of NPs with the ability to overcome both the BBB and the gastrointestinal barrier are needed. Currently, the approaches for administering drugs through the BBB are direct injection and implantation, the temporary opening of the BBB, intravenously (IV), and intranasally [81][82][83][84][85][86]. An effective nanocarrier of drugs for PD should ideally be capable of protecting the drug from physiological conditions, overcoming the BBB and target neurons in the brain, and guaranteeing a controlled release at the site of action [19,87]. Several internalization mechanisms have been found through the BBB that are mainly influenced by the surface properties of NPs; these are receptor-mediated endocytosis, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and opening of tight junctions [88][89][90][91].",

            "text": "There is abundant evidence suggesting the efficiency of IN administration with enhanced CNS concentration and better therapeutic benefit compared to other traditional delivery systems [23]. \n\nThe application of nanocarriers have emerged as a promising strategy for drug delivery in recent years, offering significant advantages over traditional drug delivery methods. These carriers, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, exosomes, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), can be designed to encapsulate and deliver drugs to specific cells or tissues, minimizing off-target effects and reducing toxicity. The use of nanocarriers in neurodegenerative diseases and brain disorders shows great potential for delivering drugs that target specific pathological mechanisms involved in these diseases. Recent scientific papers have explored various approaches to optimize the functionality and specificity of nanocarriers. \n\nThe peptide-based functionalization of NDS showed significant advantages, including the augmentation of the ability of nano delivery systems (NDS) to target specific receptors or mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells [24]. The peptide-based functionalization with EVs paved the way for the conjugation of biological NDS with receptor-targeted peptides for cancer therapy and diagnosis. Additionally, the surface functionalization of EVs has shown promise in achieving better targetability and specificity for drug delivery [25]. \n\nOverall, the use of nanocarriers, including exosomes and EVs, has the potential to revolutionize drug delivery in treating various diseases. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved in nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery and optimize their use in clinical settings. Recent studies have shown promising results, including developing the first A\u03b2-targeted ratiometric H 2 O 2 -responsive fluorescent probe for the real-time detection and monitoring of the A\u03b2-induced H 2 O 2 level in cell and AD mouse models [26]. \n\nNanocarriers represent an exciting area of research with the potential to significantly improve the efficacy and safety of drug delivery for a wide range of diseases. Developing more effective and specific nanocarriers holds promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases and brain disorders. The developments in novel drug delivery systems have enabled formulation scientists to explore the potential of nanocarrier systems to achieve better therapeutic benefits [27].",

Among other employed techniques, nanoparticles can be engineered to move desired molecules or compounds into target locations by using electrostatic forces, bioactive ligand conjugation, or convection enhanced delivery. \n\nRecent advances in nanotechnology have paved the way for efficient delivery of therapeutic drugs to brain and across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Drugs that are known to be poorly distributed in the brain parenchyma were said to have higher drug bioavailability when loaded onto a nanocarrier system that could interacts well with the endothelial micro-vessel cells. These nanocarriers were known to further be functionalized (conjugated) with targeting ligands (e.g. folic acid) to selectively bind to putative receptors or transporters expressed at the BBB for enhanced CNS selectivity and permeability. [27] Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNP) are generally a matrix of physiological lipids (fatty acids, glycerides, glycerine, waxes and their mixture), that remain solid at room or body temperature. SLNP were used as cancer drugs carriers to efficiently deliver the drugs to the brain. [28,29] Another important recent application is in Alzheimer's disease, that is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with distinct neuropathological features. The disease was said to be inflicted in about three percent of world's population between the age of 65 to 74 years, and nearly half of the population aged 85 years or older. [30] Quercetin, a phytochemical flavonoid, was said to be a novel neuroprotectant by inhibiting the increased levels of reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondrial activity, which are known to accelerate the neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer's disease. [31] Dhawan et. al. [32] reported an enhanced delivery of quercetin into the brain by encapsulation in optimized formulations of SLNP that were prepared by microencapsulation technique using compritol as the lipid and Tween 80 as the surfactant.",

The BBB allows for the entrance of essential nutrients while excluding harmful substances, including most therapeutic agents; hence, brain disorders, especially tumours, are very difficult to treat. Chitosan is a well-researched polymer that offers advantageous biological and chemical properties, such as mucoadhesion and the ease of functionalisation. Chitosan-based nanocarriers (CsNCs) establish ionic interactions with the endothelial cells, facilitating the crossing of drugs through the BBB by adsorptive mediated transcytosis. This process is further enhanced by modifications of the structure of chitosan, owing to the presence of reactive amino and hydroxyl groups. Finally, by permanently binding ligands or molecules, such as antibodies or lipids, CsNCs have showed a boosted passage through the BBB, in both in vivo and in vitro studies which will be discussed in this review.",

However, therapeutic drugs need to be upgraded in an innovative manner and significant effort has been devoted to this area. Drugs play an important role in all stages of disease treatment. Research on TBI as a brain disease is increasingly focusing on nanocarriers and targeted drug delivery systems. \n\nNanocarrier drug delivery systems can overcome a variety of biological barriers, improve drug bioavailability, increase intracellular penetration and retention time, achieve drug enrichment, control drug release, and achieve targeted drug delivery to the brain. In the treatment of TBIs, the advantages of nanocarrier delivery systems are more prominent, and an ideal nanocarrier can facilitate the penetration of therapeutic drugs through the BBB. In addition, nanocarriers can be modified to achieve the targeting of therapeutic drugs, reduce the systemic toxicity caused by drugs, and reduce the adverse reactions of drugs. MNPs are being prepared to guide drug targeting to specific sites under the action of a magnetic field. Specific receptors can recognize the combination of nanoparticles and peptides to achieve endocytosis before the drug is absorbed by many specific sites containing the receptor to achieve targeted drug delivery. The homing effect, differentiation, regeneration, and the secretion of trophic factors secreted by stem cells can help to repair damaged tissues and improve inflammation. Drugs can be loaded inside or on the surface of neutrophils and other white blood cells that can spontaneously migrate to the site of inflammation to achieve targeted drug delivery. However, nanocarriers also have many shortcomings that need to be improved. For example, the development and application of lipid-based nanoparticles is limited due to their low drug loading, the inability to load macromolecular substances, and low biodistribution, thus leading to high uptake rates in the liver and spleen. MNPs are limited by low solubility and toxicity, especially in formulations using heavy metals; thus, their clinical use is often limited. \n\nNanoparticles and modified targeted drug delivery systems have broad prospects for the treatment of TBI according to their own characteristics.",

            "text": "These compounds can be \"solubilized\" by formulating them into crystalline nanosuspensions that are stabilized by surfactants or by combining them with organic or lipid nanoparticles that keep them in circulation for longer periods. If an efficacious compound has a short half-life in the circulation, its stability can be increased tremendously by encasing it within, for example, nanosized liposome as a drug carrier. In the case of cancers, for example, of central nervous system, many drugs have difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier to attack the tumor. Drug-loaded nanoparticles are able to penetrate this barrier and have been shown to greatly increase therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drugs in brain tumors. The best way to increase the efficiency and to reduce the toxicity of a drug is to direct it into its target and maintain its concentration at the site for a sufficient time for therapeutic action to take effect [22]. The majority of solid tumors exhibit a vascular pore cutoff size between 380 and 780 nm [9], although tumor vasculature organization may differ depending on the tumor type, its growth rate, and microenvironment. Therefore, particles need to be of a size much smaller than the cutoff pore diameter to reach to the target tumor sites. By contrast, normal vasculature is impermeable to drug associated carriers larger than 2 to 4 nm compared to free, unassociated drug molecules. This nanosized window offers the opportunity to increase drug accumulation and local concentration in target sites such as tumor or inflamed sites by extravasations and significantly to reduce drug distribution and toxicity to normal tissues [9]. \n\nIdeal DDS can be achieved by creation of materials undergoing no chemical changes and satisfying the demands of biodegradability and biocompatibility of the nanoparticles carrier, the rate of biodegradation of the carrier, and the release dynamics of the drug [15,27]. For example, for socalled passive targeting to be successful, the nanocarriers need to circulate in the blood for extended times so that there will be multiple possibilities for the nanocarriers to pass by the target site.",

The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that has a highly selective permeability system is the main problem when delivering therapeutic agents to the brain [30]. Nanoparticles can be the possible solution for delivering drugs across the barrier. The BBB is made up of specific vascular endothelial cells that bound with neurons, pericytes, and astrocytes. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have the potential to deliver the desired quantity of the drug to the brain. Currently, micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, and carbon nanotubes as nanocarriers are being investigated to overcome the blood-brain barrier [31]. Size, charge, and surface ligands of the nanoparticles can potentially be considered for overcoming the BBB. Nanoparticles with a smaller size than 200 nm have more chances to cross the BBB via the clathrinmediated mechanism [32]. Positively charged nanoparticles preferentially use the adsorptive transcytosis pathway than the neutral or negatively charged [33] In addition, coating the nanoparticles with surface ligands increases the possibilities of crossing the BBB. For example, nanoparticles coated with cell-penetrating peptides can avoid the endocytic pathway and deliver the nanoparticles directly in the cell cytoplasm [34]. Some researcher group has taken the advantage of transport-receptor mediated transcytosis (GLUT1 or albumin transporters, LF receptors, LRP1 (targeted by angiopep-2), or Tf receptors) to overcome the BBB [35][36][37]. An interesting example is the use of MRIguided focused ultrasound to locally disrupt the BBB [38]. Overall,    nanoparticle conjugation with therapeutic agents may prove to be a promising tool in brain drug targeting for safer therapies.",

            "text": "Bioinspired carriers such as blood cells, cell-membrane-coated nanocarriers, exosomes, etc., are being explored recently for drug delivery across BBB due to their longer circulation life and biocompatibility [79]. Leukocytes such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils are most explored for brain delivery due to their inherent chemotactic recruitment property, especially brain diseases with inflammation. In such methods, drugs are first loaded in nanocarriers which are then incorporated into cells to facilitate delivery across the BBB. For instance, Xue et al. have used neutrophils to deliver paclitaxel loaded liposomes in residual tissue post-surgery which have suppressed the recurrence of glioma growth [166]. To treat ischemic stroke, Xu et al. have developed a 'nanoplatelet' by coating a neuroprotective agent loaded dextran-based nanocarrier with platelet membrane surface-engineered with thrombin-responsive anti-ischemic drug and TAT peptide. This 'nanoplatelet' crosses the BBB, clears the thrombus clog at the ischemic site in the brain and delivers neuroprotective agent to combat ischemic stroke [167]. In another study, to combat encephalitis Yuan et al. have utilized a macrophage-derived exosome for delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to inflamed brain [168]. Such BDNF-loaded exosomes crosses BBB via intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) which is upregulated under encephalitis-related inflammation. However, cell-based carriers suffer from some common limitations such as viability of cell-based carriers arising due to leaching of drug from nanocarriers. In addition, there are some cell-specific limitations like risk of immune activation while using leukocytes or activation of platelets while using it as drug carrier that may cause undesired thrombosis or bleeding. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles which show ~0.5% passive brain accumulation and have attracted attention for drug delivery to brain and treating neurological conditions.",

The advantages of nanocarrier systems in the delivery of bioactive molecules to diseased cells have been intensively investigated in vitro and in vivo in the past decade, although clinical trials seem to be in early phases with some results not as expected. Nanocarrier systems may protect bioactive molecules from enzymatic degradation and immune recognition. Also, nanocarrier systems can deliver a drug payload as a reservoir through mechanisms such as endocytosis, in which the nanocarrier sacrifices its surface energy to detach a small piece of the cell membrane and trigger internalization. The delivery efficiency is much higher than when single molecules cross the cell membrane by the various other mechanisms such as facilitated diffusional transport, active transport and receptor-mediated transport. Nanocarrier systems can be further conjugated to a ligand to target a corresponding biomarker on the membrane of a relevant target cell. Such nanocarrier materials, if of appropriate size and surface functionality can escape excretion by the reticuloendothelial system and thus realize sustained delivery, prolonging the agent's half-life with a more desirable biodistribution. Moreover, well designed nanomedicines may get through the various biological drug barriers such as those within the gastrointestinal tract for oral delivery (Hatton et al., 2015;McDonald et al., 2014) and the blood-brain barrier for treatment of brain diseases (Nunes et al., 2012), to give just two examples.\n\nCo-delivery of siRNA with bioactive molecules may overcome multidrug resistance of diseased cells and appropriately modified materials can inhibit the intracellular autophagy (Mei et al., 2014). However, it should be noted that there is often inconsistency between results obtained in vitro, in vivo and in clinical trials and as for any medicine, the safety must be thoroughly investigated before clinical applications can be assessed.\n\nA frequently pursued benefit for nanomedicine in drug delivery relates to their pharmacokinetic performance, with many applications aiming to improve bioavailability, distribution or residence time within the systemic circulation. The mechanisms that dictate pharmacokinetics are diverse and the complexity is underpinned by numerous molecular, cellular and physiological",

            "text": "Most neurological disorders compromise the central nervous system (CNS) and its main organ, the brain. These disorders include stroke, brain cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, neuroinfections, and traumatic disorders of the nervous system, among others (http://www.who.int/en/). Because millions of people worldwide are affected by CNS disorders, they constitute 6.3% of the global burden of disease. In other words, CNS diseases are a huge world of burden of human suffering with negative economic results [1]. Most of the therapeutic molecules cannot attain the brain because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the bloodstream from the cerebral parenchyma [2]. This barrier is mainly composed by endothelial cells, which are linked by tight junctions [3]. The BBB also contains a basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes [3]. More important is the presence of efflux transporters that perform active back-transport of the therapeutic molecules to the blood lumen. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the most important efflux transporter associated to the failure of various therapies to treat CNS diseases [4]. Advances in nanomedicine have created a non-invasive strategy for the management of CNS diseases [5]. This strategy emphasizes on the encapsulation of therapeutic compounds, which are mainly P-gp substrates, in drug delivery systems, also called nanocarriers, such as liposomes, lipid nanocapsules, polymeric nanoparticles, or polymersomes [6][7][8][9][10]. Encapsulation of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems improve their solubility and protect them from the biological environment and circumvent the P-gp at the BBB yielding higher concentrations of the therapeutic compounds in the brain parenchyma [5]. Among nanocarriers, liposomes have been the most studied due to their composition, which makes them biocompatible, biodegradable, and less toxic [11].",

            "text": "Most of the current conventional therapeutics used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, are based on high molecular weight (Mw \u2265 500 Da) Abs, peptides and proteins, which are unable to go through the BBB by themselves (Mukherjee et al., 2020). Thus, owing to the large surface area to volume ratio of NPs and thanks to the wide range of surface functionalization that can be done through different chemical groups, these nanocarriers can provide a great variety of interesting possibilities to overcome the BBB obstacle, with better results compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. Another important advantage is the NP capacity to slowly release a drug to therapeutic doses into the brain, thereby reducing peripheral toxicity (Zhang et al., 2018). To date, however, most of the research efforts on NP-mediated delivery of therapeutics against AD have been focused on animal models, with just a few drugs tested for their brain-targeted delivery by nanocarriers and limited only to lipid NPs, which are supposed to reach the essential prerequisite for clinicalstage mass production, as highlighted in He et al. (2018). Major limitations, before their large-scale clinical application, are still represented by: (i) appropriate quality control for CNS biocompatibility and safety, including their complete, efficient and fast clearance/reabsorption, (ii) establishment of the ideal mechanism of NP-mediated drug delivery into the brain, and (iii) a careful consideration of the multiple factors that may affect NP efficacy into the brain microenvironment, such as the ideal material, size and shape, surface modification. \n\nSince the BBB is made up of a layer of endothelial cell junction complexes, strategies that aim to unhinge these TJs and AJs would allow NPs to enter the brain circumventing the BBB. Polymeric NPs can either breach the BBB via surface functionalization, for instance using Abs directed against endothelial cell surface receptors leveraging the RMT route, or negatively charged on their surface, for intravenous applications, as described above in sections \"Different mechanisms of transport across the blood-brain barrier\" and \"Effect of nanoparticles surface charge\" and also reviewed in Saraiva et al. (2016).",

However, due to the presence of the rapid mucociliary clearance mechanism, nasal delivery applications for brain delivery are hindered by the short residence time of conventional formulations. Moreover, the barrier of the nasal epithelium, nasal metabolism, and the limited volume of administration are limiting aspects for the development of nose-to-brain drug delivery systems [25,27].\n\nTo increase bioavailability after nasal delivery, polymeric nanocapsules have been investigated [28][29][30]. These nanocarriers are considered a type of reservoir drug delivery system [31], and can be obtained by the interfacial deposition of pre-formed polymers [32]. Their structure is characterized by an oil core surrounded by a polymeric shell stabilized by a surfactant system [31,33]. The lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs), developed by our research group, are composed of a dispersion of sorbitan monostearate (solid lipid) and medium-chain triacylglycerols (liquid lipids) in the core, surrounded by poly(\u03b5-caprolactone), an aliphatic polyester as a polymeric wall, and polysorbate 80 as a stabilizing surfactant [34]. The lipid core dispersion, i.e., sorbitan monostearate dispersed in oil, confers different properties to this system, such as controlling the drug release and increasing the encapsulation efficiency when compared to the core of the conventional nanocapsules containing only liquid lipids [34][35][36]. These nanocarriers showed efficient brain delivery of drugs as resveratrol [37] and curcumin [38] when administered orally and intraperitoneally, as well as the reduction of the side effects of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine [39]. Furthermore, they demonstrated improved the vitro and in vivo antitumor effectiveness of resveratrol, methotrexate, and acetyleugenol when compared to the free drugs [40][41][42].",

The intranasal pathway allows for either delivery of therapeutics directly to the brain from the nose bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by traveling extracellularly along the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways, or through the vasculature route followed by system circulation in which passing the BBB is required 27 . Nanoparticles possess multiple advantages rendering them ideal candidates for intranasal delivery such as thermodynamic stability, and the ability to penetrate biological membranes including the BBB 28,29 . \n\nDespite the high prevalence of anxiety, concurrently higher disease burden, there have been far lower number of recent research on novel anxiety treatments compared to number of experimental drugs for other disorders such as major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia 6 . The aim of the present study is to prepare and evaluate for the first time -to the best of our knowledge-QRC loaded polymeric nanocapsules as an anxiety treatment utilizing the intranasal route. The effect of amount of drug and the type of surfactant on the polymeric nanocapsules characteristics was evaluated and in vivo behavioral assessments were conducted.",

In summary, the design of biomaterials for CNS and PNS injury repair necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their distinct biological, biomechanical, and biocompatibility aspects. Thus, this article reviews the fundamental research in neural injury repair that utilizes various functionalized hydrogels, explores their potential for clinical practice, and discusses the synthesis strategies and application conditions of different types of hydrogels (Figure 1).",

            "text": "The selective permeability of the BBB is due to the distinct morphology and enzymatic properties of endothelial cells that enable them to form complex tight junctions with minimal endocytic activity. This provides a physiological barrier that limits the transport of many blood-borne elements such as macromolecules and circulating leukocytes to the brain [10,11]. \n\nBrain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), a member of neurotrophic factor family is one of the most powerful neuroprotective agents for those neurons that degenerate in HIV associated Dementia (HAD) [12,13,14]. BDNF has been effective in preventing gp120-mediated toxicity in in-vitro and in-vivo conditions [15,16], increasing survival of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra after 6-OH-dopamine or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesions [17,18], protecting serotonergic neurons against the neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine [19], and rescues cortical neurons from stroke-mediated apoptotic cell death [20]. These results provide the rationale for using BDNF experimentally to rescue neurons, promote regeneration of synaptic connections and enhance neuronal plasticity in the brains of drug abusers. Therefore, use of a neuroprotective agent such as BDNF in addition to a m-opioid receptor antagonist could be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of opiate addiction [14]. However, the major problem with options using BDNF is its inability to cross the BBB [21,22] and hence the transport of drugs across BBB remains a challenge. \n\nIn recent years, advent of nanotechnology has stimulated the development of innovative systems for the delivery of drugs and diagnostic agents [23]. A significant research exploring nanocarrier drug delivery systems for crossing the BBB has focused on the delivery of anticancer drugs to brain tumors. More recently, the magnetic nanoparticles have attracted significant importance in biomedical applications and have been increasingly used as carrier for binding proteins, enzymes, or drugs.",

            "text": "This is consistent with previous findings that micelles have high association efficiencies [42,[63][64][65]. All P68 + DQA nanocarriers of NAC and NAC + DFO exhibited consistent particle sizes of 130 nm or below (polydispersity indices < 0.24) that should be of sufficient size range to enable passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) based on previous reports which suggest that a particle size of < 200 nm is required for brain penetrance [41,61,66]. As it is widely accepted that smaller particle size may be advantageous to assist with brain delivery [41,61,66], our results suggests that these NAC formulations may be more suited as neurological treatments compared to other antioxidants such as curcumin, which have been tested in the same delivery system alone and in combination with DFO [42]. The positive charge of the drug-associated P68 + DQA nanocarriers is consistent with previous reports for formulations using dequalinium [40,42]. Although positive, the mean surface charges of the NAC and NAC + DFO P68 + DQA formulations were relatively neutral (< +7 mV) (Table 1), suggesting that NAC P68 + DQA nanocarriers, with and without the combination of DFO, could access the brain without causing any toxicity to the BBB [41,[67][68][69][70][71]. XRD studies revealed that the crystalline nature of NAC and the combination with DFO was suppressed by formulation into P68 + DQA nanocarriers (Figure 1). The concentration ranges selected for NAC (500-10,000 \u00b5M) and tested in the FRAP assay were based on and consistent with previous literature [22,[72][73][74]. The FRAP results suggested a relationship between increased concentration and increased antioxidant capacity and highlights that at all concentrations the nanocarriers were able to maintain the antioxidant potential and stability of NAC (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Among these advances, the most important is the development of polymer nanoparticles with antineoplastic drugs adsorbed onto them [29]. As depicted in Figure 1, compared with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antineoplastic drug-loaded polymer nanoparticles have obvious advantages in several applications: (a) promotion of stimuli-responsive release: drugs in the nanocarriers can be released slowly or controllably through endogenous intracellular stimuli (e.g., pH, reduction, reactive oxygen species, or specific enzymes) [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45] or exogenous excitations (e.g., light, temperature, or voltage) [46][47][48]; (b) synergetic therapy: different drugs encapsulated in the same polymer nanoparticles can be smartly released to achieve synergistic and joint effects [49,50]; (c) crossing of biological barriers: antineoplastic drug-loaded polymer nanoparticles can be delivered orally or across the blood-brain barrier [51] as well as escape from intracellular autophagy; (d) targeted therapy: nanoparticles can be used to identify various tumors via targeting ligands conjugated onto their surfaces [52,53]; (e) enhanced tumor accumulation: the nanosized platforms can facilitate the localization of drugs to tumor tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [54,55]; (f) prolonged circulation time: high-molecular-weight polymer nanoparticles can increase the half-life of encapsulated drugs in the blood, effectively prolonging the drug retention time in the lesion [56,57]. Due to the aforementioned advantages, polymer nanoparticles can greatly improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the risks associated with radiosurgery. With advances in research and developing applications of polymer nanoparticles, the treatment of malignant spinal tumors has reached a new turning point.",

            "text": "Different animal models have been used to evaluate the in vivo behavior of SLNs and NLCs. This section addresses some in vivo applications of these nanocarriers. \n\nFor most brain disorders, there is a lack of effective treatments available that can tackle those diseases due to the difficulty of the drug reaching the brain, which is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The lipid nanoparticles have been studied as novel delivery systems that can cross the BBB and deliver the drug to its specific target [109]. Hsu et al. developed a cetyl palmitate-based, squalene cationic NLC, with PEG, Tween \u00ae 80, and Pluronic \u00ae F68 as interfacial excipients, and apomorphine as a model drug to assess BBB permeability. Cationic NLC formulations were compared with SLN and lipid emulsions, and the first ones showed a particle size of 370-430 nm, a zeta potential of 42-50 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency > 60%. The nanoparticle formulations also displayed slower release when compared to the other formulations. More importantly, in vivo bioluminescence studies of live rats showed the ability of NLCs to improve brain-specific delivery via certain blood vessels to selected regions of the brain. Therefore, NLCs were able to surpass the BBB and deliver drugs to the brain. This is due to the binding of positively charged NLCs to the paracellular area in the BBB, characterized to be rich in anionic sites. Thus, charged NLCs proved to be a success and a step forward in neurological disorders therapies [110]. \n\nWith the growing studying of nanotechnology and the possibility of modifying the surface of both SLNs and NLCs, novel studies have been developed to overcome the lack of specific target delivery. For example, in CRISPR/CAS-based gene editing and mRNAbased gene replacement techniques, it is crucial to have a delivery system that can target a specific organ or tissue to treat genetic problems using these new therapies [111].",

            "text": "The research and development of new drugs is a primary need in the world since, for many diseases, an effective cure has not yet been found. The main problems with conventional drug therapies are: (i) poor selectivity; and (ii) difficulty in crossing biological barriers. Chemotherapy, for example, is still the main therapy against cancer; however, its poor selectivity causes several side effects. On the other hand, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the blood from the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system (CNS), hinders drug delivery from the blood to the brain tissue. In recent years, new drug delivery systems are being explored to overcome these challenges. Extracellular vesicles possess several characteristics that make them suitable as drug delivery systems, such as the ability to cross biological barriers, the stability in the circulatory system, and safety; indeed, several studies investigated the possibility to use them as new drug nanocarriers [61,62]. However, some limitations to the use of EVs as drug delivery vehicles still exist as the development of a scalable and reproducible EV isolation method and the immune response that its administration may trigger. \n\nPDEVs represent a promising model for drug delivery, as they are natural products that possess several advantageous properties including safety, non-toxicity, low immunogenicity. Moreover, PDEVs can be produced on large scale and several studies have demonstrated that they are stable and resistant in the stomach-and intestinal-like solu-tions [10,13,32,48]; they have been found, after oral gavage, in intestinal stem cells, liver, colon, and dendritic cells as well as in the intestinal macrophages of mice [3,10,13,32,38,48]. Therefore, in recent years, some studies have focused on the employment of PDEVs or their derived lipids as drug delivery vehicles. \n\nParticularly, in 2013, Wang et al. developed nanovectors using lipids derived from grapefruit EVs and named them grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNVs) [63].",

            "text": "Background Targeting the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a key step for effective brain delivery of nanocarriers. We have previously discovered that combinations of BBB nutrient transporter ligands alanine and glutathione (A-GSH), increase the permeability of vesicular and polypeptide nanocarriers containing model cargo across the BBB. Our aim was to investigate dopamine- and ibuprofen-coupled 3-armed poly(l-glutamic acid) nanocarriers targeted by A-GSH for transfer across a novel human co-culture model with induced BBB properties. In addition, the protective effect of ibuprofen containing nanoparticles on cytokine-induced barrier damage was also measured. Method Drug-coupled nanocarriers were synthetized and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular effects, uptake, and permeability of the nanoparticles were investigated on a human stem cell-based co-culture BBB model with improved barrier properties induced by a small molecular cocktail. The model was characterized by immunocytochemistry and permeability for marker molecules. Nanocarrier uptake in human brain endothelial cells and midbrain organoids was quantified by spectrofluorometry and visualized by confocal microscopy. The mechanisms of cellular uptake were explored by addition of free targeting ligands, endocytic and metabolic inhibitors, co-localization of nanocarriers with intracellular organs, and surface charge modification of cells. The protective effect of ibuprofen-coupled nanocarriers was investigated against cytokine-induced barrier damage by impedance and permeability measurements. Results Targeted nanoformulations of both drugs showed elevated cellular uptake in a time-dependent, active manner via endocytic mechanisms. Addition of free ligands inhibited the cellular internalization of targeted nanocarriers suggesting the crucial role of ligands in the uptake process. A higher permeability across the BBB model was measured for targeted nanocarriers. After crossing the BBB, targeted dopamine nanocarriers subsequently entered midbrain-like organoids derived from healthy and Parkinson\u2019s disease patient-specific stem cells.",

            "text": "Drug delivery to the brain remains a hotly debated and hugely studied area in biomedicine. The transport of a vast majority of therapeutic molecules to the brain is restricted by the presence of a natural obstacle called the blood brain barrier (BBB) (Bicker et al., 2014). This limitation highlights the need to create systems idealized for the delivery of therapeutic as well as imaging agents across the BBB, thereby distributing drug molecules to desired site in the brain. \n\nBacteriophages (phages) as viruses that propagate their genetic material through infecting bacterial cells in a specific manner are thought to be the most ubiquitous biological entities in the biosphere. These viral agents in many ways are superior nanomaterials. High levels of structural organization, self-assembly into structures with nanoscale properties, well-defined geometry, and the flexibility of their small genomes to be conveniently engineered have adapted them for the fabrication of nanostructured materials. These characteristics have served as a basis for developing phage display technology. Phage display is a high-throughput and combinatorial screening methodology that can be used for building large nanomaterial libraries and subsequently identifying novel ligands with desirable attributes. To date, major part of the work within the field of phage nanobiotechnology has been focused on filamentous bacteriophages in particular M13 and its related phages including f1 and fd. M13 as the most predominantly used type of phage nanoparticles is a flexible and rod-shaped viral nanostructure nearly 6.5 nm in diameter carrying a single stranded DNA genome (Yang et al., 2013). Nanomaterial libraries constructed by using filamentous phages such as M13 are regarded as a treasure of targeting ligands especially cell-and tissue-specific peptides. Therefore, phage display libraries represent huge potential for formulating targeted drug delivery platforms. \n\nNanocarriers are emerging as attractive tools for the design of brain-targeted drug delivery vehicles. The surface of these nanoscale systems can be decorated with homing peptides derived from phage display libraries. These surface functionalized nanovehicles show optimized selectivity for brain drug delivery.",

The lack of BBB permeability is attributed to both a tight BBB junction and efflux of these drugs, primarily via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [3][4][5]. \n\nNanotechnology has emerged to overcome unmet drug delivery barriers and to achieve site targeted drug delivery. It has contributed substantially to developing nanocarriers to treat various diseases in recent decades [6,7]. In particular, liposomes have attracted much attention in drug encapsulation and delivery, and many lab scale liposome drug preparations have been transformed into clinical formulations [8,9]. These synthetic vesicles are attached to different ligands to aid in the efficient cellular binding, uptake, and intracellular processing required for targeted delivery of the cargo [10,11]. Nevertheless, these ligands on drug carriers can trigger an immune response [12][13][14][15]. Further, the difficulty in the clearance or biodegradation of these nanoparticles (NPs), which could lead to neurotoxicity, limits their use as drug delivery vehicles [16][17][18]. \n\nRecently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) started emerging as a natural carrier system for the delivery of therapeutics [19,20]. EVs, nano-sized membranous vesicles, are released by many types of cells. The natural biocompatibility, stability, permeability across several natural barriers, as well as their inherent homing aptitudes facilitates EVs' potential for targeted therapeutic drug delivery [21,22].",

            "text": "Nanomedicine-based therapies against the neurological sequelae of long COVID will require developing nanoscale delivery systems for the efficient use of antioxidants. In terms of drug delivery, antioxidants display several limitations, including (i) low permeability into the CNS due to the presence of physiological barriers such as the BBB or the spinal-blood barrier (SBB) [52]; (ii) low bioavailability associated with insolubility or instability [53]; (iii) chemical and physical barriers in the gut such as the acidic pH of the stomach, the intestinal mucosal lining, and the selectively permeable membranes of enterocytes [54]; and (iv) rapid metabolism [55]. Significant efforts have been made to improve the efficacy of antioxidant agents using various drug-delivery approaches. Figure 4 shows examples of nanocarriers fabricated with natural or synthetic compounds, e.g., lipids, polymers, or inorganic materials. In general, formulating antioxidants in nanocarriers can enhance their efficacy due to a higher stability upon encapsulation and an improved transport to the CNS compared with free antioxidant compounds.",

Unfortunately, this restriction also applies to 99.9 % of therapeutics, posing significant challenges in the treatment of brain diseases. Overcoming this barrier is critical for effective treatment of neurological disorders. Several drug delivery systems are being developed to improve transport of therapeutic agent across the BBB. For example, nanoparticles (liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers), nanocarriers (micelles, nanogels), protein-based delivery (penetrating peptides, exosomes), focused ultrasound, and most recently, a filamentous phage based nanocarriers. Filamentous bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and are not designed to infect eukaryotic cells. Recent evidence suggests that filamentous bacteriophages, such as M13, can cross BBB and enter the central nervous system (CNS). Researchers have been investigating the potential use of M13 as drug carriers, including the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. This entails modifying the bacteriophages to carry payloads such as drugs and using them as a delivery system. The BBB\u2019s complexity and the potential risks associated with changing it necessitate careful consideration in the development of such strategies. M13 nanocarrier development is ongoing, and advancements may lead to new therapeutic options for treating infections in the CNS. However, it is important to note that this field is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to assess the feasibility and safety of using modified bacteriophages to cross the BBB. This brief review attempts to compile current research on the potential use of bacteriophages for drug transport across the BBB.",

This paper explores the revolutionary impact of nanotechnology-based approaches on drug delivery, particularly in the context of targeted therapy for various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and infectious diseases. Nanotechnology enables the design of drug delivery systems at the molecular level, allowing for the development of nanoscale carriers that can deliver therapeutic agents directly to specific cells or tissues. These nanocarriers, such as liposomes, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles, can be engineered to encapsulate drugs and release them in a controlled manner, ensuring that the therapeutic agents reach their intended targets with high efficiency. This targeted approach significantly reduces the off-target effects often associated with conventional drug delivery methods, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing toxicity. One of the key advantages of nanotechnology in drug delivery is its ability to overcome biological barriers that have traditionally limited the effectiveness of therapies. For example, nanoparticles can be designed to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening new avenues for treating neurological disorders. Similarly, targeted nanoparticles can accumulate in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, allowing for more effective cancer treatment with reduced systemic toxicity. Nanotechnology also facilitates the combination of diagnostic and therapeutic functions, known as theranostics, within a single platform. This dual capability allows for real-time monitoring of drug delivery and therapeutic response, enabling personalized treatment plans that can be adjusted based on the patient\u2019s specific needs. This integration of diagnosis and therapy represents a significant leap forward in the pursuit of precision medicine. Despite the promising potential of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, challenges remain, including issues related to scalability, biocompatibility, and regulatory approval. Ongoing research and collaboration between scientists, clinicians, and industry stakeholders are essential to address these challenges and fully realize the benefits of nanotechnology in targeted therapy.

PD is linked to dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways, neuroinflammation, decreased PPAR-\u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1, increased phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes, and accelerated \u03b1-Syn amyloid fibril production caused by T2DM. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the T2DM-PD association and risk factors for PD in T2DM individuals. The study reviews existing literature using reputable sources like Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, revealing a significant association between T2DM and worsened PD symptoms. Genetic profiles of T2DM-PD individuals show similarities, and potential risk factors include insulin-resistance and dysbiosis of the gut-brain microbiome. Anti-diabetic drugs exhibit neuroprotective effects in PD, and nanoscale delivery systems like exosomes, micelles, and liposomes show promise in enhancing drug efficacy by crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). Brain targeting for PD uses exosomes, micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, solid lipid nanoparticles, nano-sized polymers, and niosomes to improve medication and gene therapy efficacy. Surface modification of nanocarriers with bioactive compounds (such as angiopep, lactoferrin, and OX26) enhances \u03b1-Syn conjugation and BBB permeability. Natural exosomes, though limited, hold potential for investigating DM-PD pathways in clinical research. The study delves into the underlying mechanisms of T2DM and PD and explores current therapeutic approaches in the field of nano-based targeted drug delivery. Emphasis is placed on resolved and ongoing issues in understanding and managing both conditions.",

Medicinal chemistry-based strategies are essentially aimed at the chemical modification of low molecular weight drugs in order to increase their lipophilicity or the design of appropriate prodrugs, although this review will focus primarily on the use of prodrugs and not analog development. Recently, interest has been focused on the design and evaluation of prodrugs that are capable of exploiting one or more of the various endogenous transport systems at the level of the blood brain barrier (BBB). The technological strategies are essentially non-invasive methods of drug delivery to malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) and are based on the use of nanosystems (colloidal carriers) such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric micelles and dendrimers. The biodistribution of these nanocarriers can be manipulated by modifying their surface physico-chemical properties or by coating them with surfactants and polyethylene-glycols (PEGs). Liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles are promising systems for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS. This mini-review discusses issues concerning the scope and limitations of both the medicinal chemistry and technological approaches. Based on the current findings, it can be concluded that crossing of the BBB and drug delivery to CNS is extremely complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach such as a close collaboration and common efforts among researchers of several scientific areas, particularly medicinal chemists, biologists and pharmaceutical technologists.",

Therefore, poorly-soluble drugs, fragile proteins or nucleic acid products may benefit from their encapsulation in nanosized vehicles, providing enhanced solubilization, protection against degradation, and increased access to pathological compartments. A key element for the success of drug-loaded nanocarriers is their ability to either cross biological barriers themselves, or allow loaded drugs to traverse them to achieve optimal pharmacological action at pathological sites. Depending on the mode of administration, nanocarriers may have to cross different physiological barriers in their journey towards their target. In this review, the crossing of biological barriers by passive targeting strategies will be presented for intravenous delivery (vascular endothelial lining, particularly for tumor vasculature and blood brain barrier targeting), oral administration (gastrointestinal lining), and upper airway administration (pulmonary epithelium). For each specific barrier, background information will be provided on the structure and biology of the tissues involved as well as available pathways for nano-objects or loaded drugs (diffusion and convection through fenestration, transcytosis, tight junction crossing, etc.). The determinants of passive targeting - size, shape, surface chemistry, surface patterning of nanovectors - will be discussed in light of current results. Perspectives on each mode of administration will be presented.

The BBB prevents many therapeutic agents from reaching the brain, complicating treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson\u2019s, and other neurological disorders. By utilizing the nasal route, drugs can directly access the brain through the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways, ensuring more effective delivery while minimizing systemic side effects. The review discusses various drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles, which enhance drug solubility, targeting, and bioavailability. These systems are particularly suitable for nose-to-brain delivery, with nanotechnology playing a crucial role in overcoming biological barriers and ensuring sustained or controlled drug release. Despite these advancements, challenges like toxicity, scalability, and regulatory concerns remain. Preclinical models, including in silico, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies, are vital to understanding how drugs interact with the nasal mucosa and are transported to the brain. These models help optimize formulations and improve drug absorption and brain targeting. Looking ahead, advancements in delivery devices and formulations will be crucial for improving the efficiency and reliability of nasal drug delivery. Innovations such as stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, mucoadhesive formulations, and nasal in situ gels show promise in enhancing drug retention and controlled release.

More than 25 small vesicles were prepared by lipid film hydration/extrusion to generate small unilamellar vesicles. The fluorescence marker calcein was encapsulated to mimic hydrophilic drug transport. Marker uptake by MDCK cells seems to be mediated by different mechanisms for the liposomes used. It was mainly depending on membrane fluidity and vesicle charge. Liposomes L2 with a positive charge (325 +/- 3 pmol/well) and vesicles L3 containing the helper lipid dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in their membrane (216 +/- 42 pmol/well) were taken up to the most. Selected liposomes were tested for their transcytotic transport across a MDCK monolayer. Liposomes L4 containing equimolar DOPE and octadecyl-1,1-dimethylpiperidin-1-ium-4-yl phosphate (OPP) were the most efficient vesicles for transcellular transport resulting in 808 +/- 30 pmol calcein/cm(2) in the basal medium (28.1% of total liposomal marker added). Transcytosis was positively correlated with membrane fluidity in the outer part of the bilayer, as electron paramagnetic resonance measurements revealed. We expect that an increase in membrane fluidity of vesicles should also improve the restricted transport of hydrophilic drugs across the blood-brain barrier."

The current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on alleviating pathological symptoms rather than providing a possible cure. AD is one of the highly studied but least understood neurological problems and remains an unresolved condition of human brain degeneration. Over the years, multiple naturally derived small molecules, including plant products, microbial isolates, and some metabolic byproducts, have been projected as supplements reducing the risk or possible treatment of the disease. However, unfortunately, none has met the expected success. One major challenge for most medications is their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In past decades, nanotechnology-based interventions have offered an alternative platform to address the problem of the successful delivery of the drugs to the specific targets. Interestingly, the exciting interface of natural products and nanomedicine is delivering promising results in AD treatment. The potential applications of flavonoids, the plant-derived compounds best known for their antioxidant activities, and their amalgamation with nanomedicinal approaches may lead to highly effective therapeutic strategies for treating well-known neurodegenerative diseases. In the present review, we explore the possibilities and recent developments on an exciting combination of flavonoids and nanoparticles in AD.",

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease (APHD) are regarded as the three major neurodegenerative diseases. There is a vast body of literature on the causes and treatments of these neurodegenerative diseases. However, the main obstacle in developing an effective treatment strategy is the permeability of the treatment components at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Several strategies have been developed to improve this obstruction. For example, nanomaterials facilitate drug delivery to the BBB due to their size. They have been used widely in nanomedicine and as nanoprobes for diagnosis purposes among others in neuroscience. Nanomaterials in different forms, such as nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and liposomes, have been used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. This review will cover the basic concepts and applications of nanomaterials in the therapy of APHD."

Additionally, the number of biotherapeutic agents entering the Pharmaceutical sector continues to increase and according to EvaluatePharma's \"World Preview 2014\" report, \"the compounded annual growth rate of biologics is expected to be 8.5 percent from 2008-2014, eight to 10 times greater than the growth rate of small molecules\". However, there are limited examples of success in developing biotherapeutic modalities for central nervous system (CNS) diseases in the drug development pipeline. A primary reason for the lack of application of biotherapeutics to neuroscience targets, is that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) isolates and protects CNS structures creating a unique biochemically and immunologically privileged environment, therefore passage of macromolecules across this barrier has additional challenges. An understanding of the anatomical and physiological properties of this barrier with respect to penetration of biotherapeutics is presented in this review document. In this summary, recent advances in biotherapeutic delivery mechanisms across the BBB including transcranial brain drug delivery, focused ultrasound technology, nasal delivery, absorptive endocytosis, and receptor mediated endocytosis are evaluated using an industrial perspective. With acknowledgement that each approach has advantages and disadvantages, this review discusses the opportunities and challenges that are encountered during application of these methods across a variety of therapeutic areas such as, pain, obesity, neuroscience, and oncology. Utilizing an industrial perspective, including consideration of cost of goods and commercial feasibility for these approaches, this review highlights technology features which would enable industry investments toward novel BBB delivery technologies for biologics. Through continued development and improvement of such technology, new therapeutic options to treat and potentially cure central nervous system diseases could eventually evolve."

As a result, at most, a small percentage of a drug that is administered systemically will reach the central nervous system in its active form. Currently, research in the field focuses on developing safer and more effective approaches to deliver peptides and proteins into the central nervous system. Multiple strategies have been developed for this purpose. However, noninvasive approaches, such as nanostructured protein delivery carriers and intranasal administration, seem to be the most promising strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases, which require long-term interventions. These approaches are both target-specific and able to rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier. In this Perspective, we detail some of these strategies and discuss some of the potential pitfalls and opportunities in this field. The next generation strategies will most likely be more cell-type-specific. Devising these strategies to target the brain may ultimately become a novel therapeutic modality to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

As access to the human brain is limited, many studies have been performed in experimental animals. Whereas providing interesting data, such studies have room for improvement to provide mechanistic insight into the rate and extent of specifically BBB transport and intrabrain distribution processes that all together govern CNS target delivery of the free drug. This review shortly summarizes BBB transport and current liposome-based strategies to overcome BBB transport restrictions, with the emphasis on how to determine the individual mechanisms that all together determine the time course of free drug brain concentrations, following their administration as such, and in liposomes. Animal studies using microdialysis providing time course information on unbound drug in plasma and brain are highlighted, as these provide the mechanistic information needed to understand BBB drug transport of the drug, and the impact of a liposomal formulations of that drug on BBB transport. Overall, these studies show that brain distribution of a drug administered as liposomal formulation depends on both drug properties and liposomal formulation characteristics. In general, evidence suggests that active transporters at the BBB, either being influx or efflux transporters, are circumvented by liposomes. It is concluded that liposomal formulations may provide interesting changes in BBB transport. More mechanistic studies are needed to understand relevant mechanisms in liposomal drug delivery to the brain, providing an improved basis for its prediction in human using animal data."

Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK\u2010NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4\u2010carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH\u2010responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ.

A brain-targeted gene delivery system based on a transferrin (Tf) and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) dual-functionalized liposome, CPP-Tf-liposome, was designed and investigated for crossing BBB and permeating into the brain. We selected three sequences of CPPs [melittin, Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (kFGF), and penetration accelerating sequence\u2013R8] and compared their ability to internalize into the cells and, subsequently, improve the transfection efficiency. Study of intracellular uptake indicated that liposomal penetration into bEnd.3 cells, primary astrocytes, and primary neurons occurred through multiple endocytosis pathways and surface modification with Tf and CPP enhanced the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles. A coculture in vitro BBB model reproducing the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the biologic barrier was developed to characterize the penetrating properties of these designed liposomes. The dual-functionalized liposomes effectively crossed the in vitro barrier model followed by transfecting primary neurons. Liposome tissue distribution in vivo indicated superior ability of kFGF-Tf-liposomes to overcome BBB and reach brain of the mice after single intravenous administration. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using strategically designed liposomes by combining Tf receptor targeting with enhanced cell penetration as a potential brain gene delivery vector. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rational synthesis of efficient brain-targeted gene carrier included modification of liposomes with a target-specific ligand, transferrin, and with cell-penetrating peptide to enhance cellular internalization. Our study used an in vitro triple coculture blood-brain barrier (BBB) model as a tool to characterize the permeability across BBB and functionality of designed liposomes prior to in vivo biodistribution studies.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide. Several treatment strategies focusing on the amyloid cascade have been implemented to treat AD. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses the main obstructive barrier by refraining drugs from penetrating the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising research field for brain drug delivery using nanosized particles. Zebrafish is emerging as a model of interest to elaborate on brain targeting and nanotechnology-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we have synthesized and characterized chrysin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Chr-Chi NPs) and evaluated them for neuroprotection against amyloid-\u03b2-induced toxicity. We find that treatment with Chr-Chi NPs helps to retain memory, cognition, and synaptic connections, which are otherwise compromised due to A\u03b21-42 toxicity. The NPs further help in reducing aggregates of amyloid \u03b2, thus decreasing neuronal death and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, our study brings to light a novel strategy for treating AD by a combined action on the neurons and amyloid aggregates mediated by chrysin and chitosan, respectively.

The albumin-binding proteins (e.g., SPARC and gp60) are overexpressed in many tumors for transport of albumin as an amino acid and an energy source for fast-growing cancer cells. However, their application in brain delivery has rarely been investigated. In this work, SPARC and gp60 overexpression was found on glioma and tumor vessel endothelium; therefore, such pathways were explored for use in brain-targeting biomimetic delivery. We developed a green method for blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating albumin nanoparticle synthesis, with the capacity to coencapsulate different drugs and no need for cross-linkers. The hydrophobic drugs (i.e., paclitaxel and fenretinide) yield synergistic effects to induce albumin self-assembly, forming dual drug-loaded nanoparticles. The albumin nanoparticles can penetrate the BBB and target glioma cells via the mechanisms of SPARC- and gp60-mediated biomimetic transport. Importantly, by modification with the cell-penetrating peptide LMWP, the albumin nanoparticles display enhanced BBB penetration, intratumoral infiltration, and cellular uptake. The LMWP-modified nanoparticles exhibited improved treatment outcomes in both subcutaneous and intracranial glioma models, with reduced toxic side effects. The therapeutic mechanisms were associated with induction of apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, and tumor immune microenvironment regulation. It provides a facile method for dual drug-loaded albumin nanoparticle preparation and a promising avenue for biomimetic delivery targeting the brain tumor based on combination therapy.",

Among these molecules, few mechanism based peptide inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation (QBP1, NT17 and PGQ9P2) have shown promising activity; however, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low bioavailability, and low half-life may hinder their therapeutic potential. Hence, to deliver them to the brain for assessing their efficacy, we have designed and synthesized peptide loaded poly-d,l-lactide- co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles of less than 200 nm in size by carbodiimide chemistry and nanoprecipitation protocols. For brain delivery, PLGA nanoparticles were coated with polysorbate 80 which aids receptor mediated internalization. Using the in vitro BBB model of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and healthy mice, the translocation of polysorbate 80 coated fluorescent nanoparticles was confirmed. Moreover, QBP1, NT17, and PGQ9P2 loaded PLGA nanoparticles showed dose dependent inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation in cell models of HD (Neuro 2A and PC12 cells) and improved motor performance in Drosophila model of HD. Additionally, no toxicity in cells and animals confirmed biocompatibility of the nanoparticulate formulations. Based on this work, future studies can be designed in higher animal models to test peptide loaded nanoparticles in HD and other polyglutamine expansion related diseases.",

Harnessing the possibility of delivering neuroactive drugs by way of receptors already present on the brain endothelium has been of interest for many years. The transferrin receptor is of special interest since its expression is limited to the endothelium of the brain as opposed to peripheral endothelium. Here, we investigate the possibility of delivering immunoliposomes and their encapsulated cargo to the brain via targeting of the transferrin receptor. We find that transferrin receptor-targeting increases the association between the immunoliposomes and primary endothelial cells in vitro, but that this does not correlate with increased cargo transcytosis. Furthermore, we show that the transferrin receptor-targeted immunoliposomes accumulate along the microvessels of the brains of rats, but find no evidence for transcytosis of the immunoliposome. Conversely, the increased accumulation correlated both with increased cargo uptake in the brain endothelium and subsequent cargo transport into the brain. These findings suggest that transferrin receptor-targeting is a relevant strategy of increasing drug exposure to the brain."

In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range (Amyere et al., 2002). This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides (Kaplan et al., 2005). Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models (Ojewole et al., 2008)(Amiji et al., 2006)(Popovic et al., 2006)(Koziara et al., 2004).

                    "[22756643 | Amyere et al. | 2002 | Citations: 184]": "Macropinocytosis refers to the formation of primary large endocytic vesicles of irregular size and shape, generated by actin-driven evaginations of the plasma membrane, whereby cells avidly incorporate extracellular fluid. Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."

Their use may address some of the most pressing challenges in drug delivery, such as solubilizing poorly water-soluble drugs, protecting labile drugs from degradation, and delivering drugs selectively to disease sites. These nanosized structures penetrate tissue, facilitate efficient uptake of the drug by cells, enable successful drug delivery, and ensure activity at the targeted location. The uptake of nanostructures by cells is much higher than that of large particles. (Mirza et al., 2014)(Kabanov et al., 2002) Modifying or functionalizing nanoparticles to deliver drugs through the bloodbrain barrier for targeting maladies of the central nervous system has been one superb outcome of medical nanotechnology.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the homeostasis of the brain\u2019s microenvironment and impedes the penetration of 98% of drugs. Therefore, effective treatment requires the better drug transport across membranes and increased drug distribution. Nanoparticles are a good choice for drugs to cross BBB. The main pathways of nano delivery systems through BBB include passive diffusion, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated transport, carrier-mediated transport, etc. At present, the materials used in brain-targeted delivery can be divided into natural polymer, synthetic polymers, inorganic materials and phospholipid. In this review, we first introduced several ways of nano delivery systems crossing the BBB, and then summarized their applications in ischemic stroke. Based on their potential and challenges in the treatment of ischemic stroke, new ideas and prospects are proposed for designing feasible and effective nano delivery systems."

It's important to establish this context before discussing specific carrier types and their efficiency. This will be a synthesis since it requires explaining concepts rather than listing items.\n\n2. \"Types of Nanocarriers Used for BBB Drug Delivery\" (list): This dimension will categorize the different types of nanocarriers mentioned in the quotes. A list format is appropriate since we're enumerating distinct categories of delivery systems.\n\n3. \"Mechanisms of BBB Crossing\" (synthesis): This dimension will explain how nanocarriers cross the BBB. This is best presented as a synthesis to clearly explain the complex biological processes involved.\n\n4. \"Liposomes: Efficiency and Modifications\" (synthesis): Since liposomes are extensively mentioned in the quotes with specific information about their efficiency, this dimension will synthesize the evidence about liposome performance in crossing the BBB.\n\n5. \"Polymeric Nanoparticles: Efficiency and Applications\" (synthesis): Similar to liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles are frequently mentioned, requiring a synthesis of their effectiveness in crossing the BBB.\n\n6. \"Lipid-Based Nanocarriers: Performance and Advantages\" (synthesis): This dimension will cover solid lipid nanoparticles and other lipid-based systems mentioned in the quotes.\n\n7. \"Exosomes and Bioinspired Carriers: Emerging Solutions\" (synthesis): This dimension will focus on exosomes and other biologically inspired carriers that show promise for BBB crossing.\n\n8. \"Comparative Efficiency of Different Nanocarrier Systems\" (synthesis): This final dimension will directly address the user's question about which carriers have demonstrated the highest efficiency by synthesizing comparative information from the quotes.\n\nEach dimension is designed to build a comprehensive understanding of nanocarrier BBB crossing efficiency, progressing from basic concepts to specific carrier types and finally to direct comparisons of efficiency.",

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the homeostasis of the brain\u2019s microenvironment and impedes the penetration of 98% of drugs. Therefore, effective treatment requires the better drug transport across membranes and increased drug distribution. Nanoparticles are a good choice for drugs to cross BBB. The main pathways of nano delivery systems through BBB include passive diffusion, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated transport, carrier-mediated transport, etc. At present, the materials used in brain-targeted delivery can be divided into natural polymer, synthetic polymers, inorganic materials and phospholipid. In this review, we first introduced several ways of nano delivery systems crossing the BBB, and then summarized their applications in ischemic stroke. Based on their potential and challenges in the treatment of ischemic stroke, new ideas and prospects are proposed for designing feasible and effective nano delivery systems."

                            "Nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range (Amyere et al., 2002). This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides (Kaplan et al., 2005). Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models (Ojewole et al., 2008)(Amiji et al., 2006)(Popovic et al., 2006)(Koziara et al., 2004). These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based."

                            "Macropinocytosis refers to the formation of primary large endocytic vesicles of irregular size and shape, generated by actin-driven evaginations of the plasma membrane, whereby cells avidly incorporate extracellular fluid. Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."

                            "Nanomedicine and nano delivery systems are a relatively new but rapidly developing science where materials in the nanoscale range are employed to serve as means of diagnostic tools or to deliver therapeutic agents to specific targeted sites in a controlled manner. Nanotechnology offers multiple benefits in treating chronic human diseases by site-specific, and target-oriented delivery of precise medicines. Recently, there are a number of outstanding applications of the nanomedicine (chemotherapeutic agents, biological agents, immunotherapeutic agents etc.) in the treatment of various diseases. The current review, presents an updated summary of recent advances in the field of nanomedicines and nano based drug delivery systems through comprehensive scrutiny of the discovery and application of nanomaterials in improving both the efficacy of novel and old drugs (e.g., natural products) and selective diagnosis through disease marker molecules. The opportunities and challenges of nanomedicines in drug delivery from synthetic/natural sources to their clinical applications are also discussed. In addition, we have included information regarding the trends and perspectives in nanomedicine area."

                            "Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and brain cancers are difficult to treat with current drugs as their delivery efficacy to the brain is severely hampered by the presence of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Drug delivery systems have been extensively explored in recent decades aiming to circumvent this barrier. In particular, polymeric nanoparticles have shown enormous potentials owing to their unique properties, such as high tunability, ease of synthesis, and control over drug release profile. However, careful analysis of their performance in effective drug transport across the BBB should be performed using clinically relevant testing models. In this review, polymeric nanoparticle systems for drug delivery to the central nervous system are discussed with an emphasis on the effects of particle size, shape, and surface modifications on BBB penetration. Moreover, the authors critically analyze the current in vitro and in vivo models used to evaluate BBB penetration efficacy, including the latest developments in the BBB\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip models. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the development of polymeric nanoparticles to combat neurological disorders are discussed."

Others facilitate transcytosis, where the carrier is transported through the endothelial cell layer, or endocytosis, where the carrier enters the cell and releases the drug intracellularly <Paper corpusId=\"252394332\" paperTitle=\"(Grifoni et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, certain nanocarriers can inhibit drug efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein at the BBB, particularly when coated with agents such as polysorbates <Paper corpusId=\"252394332\" paperTitle=\"(Grifoni et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMacropinocytosis represents another important non-receptor mediated endocytosis pathway for nanocarrier transport. This relatively non-specific process permits cellular uptake of particles up to the micron size range, making it particularly valuable for larger nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles (200-300 nm in diameter) <Paper corpusId=\"26782838\" paperTitle=\"(N et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22756643\" paperTitle=\"(Amyere et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface modifications significantly enhance the BBB penetration efficiency of nanocarriers.

For example, butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 leverage the surfactant's ability to adsorb apolipoproteins, enabling tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles have shown an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"269512854\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond facilitating transport across the BBB, nanocarriers offer additional advantages by protecting drugs from degradation, enhancing drug metabolism kinetics, and improving neurovascular pathways <Paper corpusId=\"273265083\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the homeostasis of the brain\u2019s microenvironment and impedes the penetration of 98% of drugs. Therefore, effective treatment requires the better drug transport across membranes and increased drug distribution. Nanoparticles are a good choice for drugs to cross BBB. The main pathways of nano delivery systems through BBB include passive diffusion, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated transport, carrier-mediated transport, etc. At present, the materials used in brain-targeted delivery can be divided into natural polymer, synthetic polymers, inorganic materials and phospholipid. In this review, we first introduced several ways of nano delivery systems crossing the BBB, and then summarized their applications in ischemic stroke. Based on their potential and challenges in the treatment of ischemic stroke, new ideas and prospects are proposed for designing feasible and effective nano delivery systems."

                            "Nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range (Amyere et al., 2002). This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides (Kaplan et al., 2005). Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models (Ojewole et al., 2008)(Amiji et al., 2006)(Popovic et al., 2006)(Koziara et al., 2004). These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based."

                            "Macropinocytosis refers to the formation of primary large endocytic vesicles of irregular size and shape, generated by actin-driven evaginations of the plasma membrane, whereby cells avidly incorporate extracellular fluid. Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."

For instance, glycosylated liposomes have demonstrated superior ability to target the cerebellum compared to standard PEGylated liposomes <Paper corpusId=\"250710614\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similar to other nanocarriers, coating liposomes with surfactants such as polysorbate-80 significantly improves BBB penetration by leveraging the surfactant's ability to adsorb apolipoproteins, enabling tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"269512854\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cationization of liposomes also markedly increases their BBB permeability, with one study showing an eightfold increase compared to non-cationized counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"269512854\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFunctionalized liposomes have shown particular promise in treating neurodegenerative conditions. For example, lipid-based nanocarriers have successfully transported therapeutic compounds like curcumin across the BBB, reducing amyloid plaque accumulation in Alzheimer's disease models <Paper corpusId=\"276076597\" paperTitle=\"(Sahu et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, sphingolipid-based liposomes offer enhanced stability compared to conventional liposomal formulations, making them particularly effective for delivering lipophilic drugs to the brain <Paper corpusId=\"273322230\" paperTitle=\"(Cong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"271531873\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLiposomes have also been adapted for alternative delivery routes that bypass the BBB entirely. Nasal drug delivery systems utilizing liposomes enhanced for mucosal penetration can significantly improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, providing a direct pathway to the brain <Paper corpusId=\"269512854\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Nanomedicine and nano delivery systems are a relatively new but rapidly developing science where materials in the nanoscale range are employed to serve as means of diagnostic tools or to deliver therapeutic agents to specific targeted sites in a controlled manner. Nanotechnology offers multiple benefits in treating chronic human diseases by site-specific, and target-oriented delivery of precise medicines. Recently, there are a number of outstanding applications of the nanomedicine (chemotherapeutic agents, biological agents, immunotherapeutic agents etc.) in the treatment of various diseases. The current review, presents an updated summary of recent advances in the field of nanomedicines and nano based drug delivery systems through comprehensive scrutiny of the discovery and application of nanomaterials in improving both the efficacy of novel and old drugs (e.g., natural products) and selective diagnosis through disease marker molecules. The opportunities and challenges of nanomedicines in drug delivery from synthetic/natural sources to their clinical applications are also discussed. In addition, we have included information regarding the trends and perspectives in nanomedicine area."

Due to their unique physicochemical characteristics, liposomes have been widely investigated for their application in drug delivery and in vivo bioimaging for the treatment and/or diagnosis of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and glioma. Several strategies have been used to deliver drug and/or imaging agents to the brain. Covalent ligation of such macromolecules as peptides, antibodies, and RNA aptamers is an effective method for receptor-targeting liposomes, which allows their blood\u2013brain barrier penetration and/or the delivery of their therapeutic molecule specifically to the disease site. Additionally, methods have been employed for the development of liposomes that can respond to external stimuli. It can be concluded that the development of liposomes for brain delivery is still in its infancy, although these systems have the potential to revolutionize the ways in which medicine is administered."

                            "The treatment of neurodegenerative diseases remains a tremendous challenge due to the limited access of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, especially large molecules such as peptides and proteins. As a result, at most, a small percentage of a drug that is administered systemically will reach the central nervous system in its active form. Currently, research in the field focuses on developing safer and more effective approaches to deliver peptides and proteins into the central nervous system. Multiple strategies have been developed for this purpose. However, noninvasive approaches, such as nanostructured protein delivery carriers and intranasal administration, seem to be the most promising strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases, which require long-term interventions. These approaches are both target-specific and able to rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier. In this Perspective, we detail some of these strategies and discuss some of the potential pitfalls and opportunities in this field. The next generation strategies will most likely be more cell-type-specific. Devising these strategies to target the brain may ultimately become a novel therapeutic modality to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

In vitro studies showed that the use of polymeric nanoparticles enhanced drug delivery to the brain, with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and plaque load through the improved delivery of curcumin for treating Alzheimer's disease (Barbara et al., 2017), and efficient internalization of doxorubicin into the human glioma cells, resulting in cytotoxic effect on cancer cells (Malinovskaya et al., 2017). Additionally, the in vivo experiment regarding the co-delivery of cisplatin and boldine, an antioxidant agent, using the poly(lactide-co-glycolic) nanocarriers resulted in an effective target-specific delivery for therapeutic use in brain cancer therapy [44]."

                            "The efficacy of therapeutics for brain tumors is seriously hampered by multiple barriers to drug delivery, including severe destabilizing effects in the blood circulation, the blood\u2013brain barrier/blood\u2013brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB), and limited tumor uptake. Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK\u2010NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4\u2010carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH\u2010responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ. STICK\u2010NPs exhibit prolonged circulation time (17\u2010fold higher area under curve) than the free agent, allowing increased opportunities to transpass the BBB/BBTB via glucose\u2010transporter\u2010mediated transcytosis by MA. The tumor acidic environment then triggers the transformation of the STICK\u2010NPs into smaller nanoparticles and reveals a secondary CBA targeting moiety for deep tumor penetration and enhanced uptake in tumor cells. STICK\u2010NPs significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive and chemoresistant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. This formulation tackles multiple physiological barriers on\u2010demand with a simple and smart STICK design. Therefore, these features allow STICK\u2010NPs to unleash the potential of brain tumor therapeutics to improve their treatment efficacy."

                            "Detailed study of the molecular mechanism behind the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD) suggests that polyglutamine aggregation is one of the fundamental reasons for HD. Despite the discovery of many potential molecules, HD therapy is still limited to symptomatic relief. Among these molecules, few mechanism based peptide inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation (QBP1, NT17 and PGQ9P2) have shown promising activity; however, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low bioavailability, and low half-life may hinder their therapeutic potential. Hence, to deliver them to the brain for assessing their efficacy, we have designed and synthesized peptide loaded poly-d,l-lactide- co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles of less than 200 nm in size by carbodiimide chemistry and nanoprecipitation protocols. For brain delivery, PLGA nanoparticles were coated with polysorbate 80 which aids receptor mediated internalization. Using the in vitro BBB model of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and healthy mice, the translocation of polysorbate 80 coated fluorescent nanoparticles was confirmed. Moreover, QBP1, NT17, and PGQ9P2 loaded PLGA nanoparticles showed dose dependent inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation in cell models of HD (Neuro 2A and PC12 cells) and improved motor performance in Drosophila model of HD. Additionally, no toxicity in cells and animals confirmed biocompatibility of the nanoparticulate formulations. Based on this work, future studies can be designed in higher animal models to test peptide loaded nanoparticles in HD and other polyglutamine expansion related diseases."

                            "Amyloid \u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaques of amyloid \u03b2 play a pivotal role in affecting cognitive functions and memory. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide. Several treatment strategies focusing on the amyloid cascade have been implemented to treat AD. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses the main obstructive barrier by refraining drugs from penetrating the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising research field for brain drug delivery using nanosized particles. Zebrafish is emerging as a model of interest to elaborate on brain targeting and nanotechnology-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we have synthesized and characterized chrysin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Chr-Chi NPs) and evaluated them for neuroprotection against amyloid-\u03b2-induced toxicity. We find that treatment with Chr-Chi NPs helps to retain memory, cognition, and synaptic connections, which are otherwise compromised due to A\u03b21-42 toxicity. The NPs further help in reducing aggregates of amyloid \u03b2, thus decreasing neuronal death and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, our study brings to light a novel strategy for treating AD by a combined action on the neurons and amyloid aggregates mediated by chrysin and chitosan, respectively. Chr-Chi NPs, therefore, have the potential to provide a beneficial combinatorial treatment strategy for AD."

                            "Phytotherapeutic approaches are of immense value in the treatment of advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of their diverse biological components and potential multitarget mechanisms. In this study, quercetin, a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, was encapsulated in human serum albumin to obtain HSA@QC nanoparticles (HQ NPs) as a natural phyto-antioxidant albumin nanoagent for the treatment of advanced AD. HQ NPs showed excellent antioxidant effects and protected PC12 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage. The intranasal administration of HQ NPs in 11-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which represented advanced AD, effectively prevented the loss of body weight, increased survival rates, and significantly reduced oxidative stress, A\u03b2 aggregation, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic damage in the brain. It also ultimately reversed severely impaired cognitive function. In addition to their favorable anti-AD effects, HQ NPs exhibited excellent biosafety and biocompatibility owing to their natural composition and are expected to become an ideal choice for future drug development and clinical applications."

                            "Nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery across the BBB can enhance brain delivery by three major pathways, which include: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the BBB by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB. In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific processwhich allows cellular uptake of large particles up to the micron size range (Amyere et al., 2002). This is likely a useful pathway for nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles, which are frequently 200 to 300 nmin diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of Tat-peptides (Kaplan et al., 2005). Current use of nanocarriers for brain delivery of ARVs have been studied in vitro or animal models (Ojewole et al., 2008)(Amiji et al., 2006)(Popovic et al., 2006)(Koziara et al., 2004). These nanocarriers generally fall into a few broad categories: polymer/dendrimer-based, lipid-based or micelle-based."

                            "Macropinocytosis refers to the formation of primary large endocytic vesicles of irregular size and shape, generated by actin-driven evaginations of the plasma membrane, whereby cells avidly incorporate extracellular fluid. Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."

Due to their unique physicochemical characteristics, liposomes have been widely investigated for their application in drug delivery and in vivo bioimaging for the treatment and/or diagnosis of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and glioma. Several strategies have been used to deliver drug and/or imaging agents to the brain. Covalent ligation of such macromolecules as peptides, antibodies, and RNA aptamers is an effective method for receptor-targeting liposomes, which allows their blood\u2013brain barrier penetration and/or the delivery of their therapeutic molecule specifically to the disease site. Additionally, methods have been employed for the development of liposomes that can respond to external stimuli. It can be concluded that the development of liposomes for brain delivery is still in its infancy, although these systems have the potential to revolutionize the ways in which medicine is administered."

                            "The treatment of neurodegenerative diseases remains a tremendous challenge due to the limited access of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, especially large molecules such as peptides and proteins. As a result, at most, a small percentage of a drug that is administered systemically will reach the central nervous system in its active form. Currently, research in the field focuses on developing safer and more effective approaches to deliver peptides and proteins into the central nervous system. Multiple strategies have been developed for this purpose. However, noninvasive approaches, such as nanostructured protein delivery carriers and intranasal administration, seem to be the most promising strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases, which require long-term interventions. These approaches are both target-specific and able to rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier. In this Perspective, we detail some of these strategies and discuss some of the potential pitfalls and opportunities in this field. The next generation strategies will most likely be more cell-type-specific. Devising these strategies to target the brain may ultimately become a novel therapeutic modality to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

Blood cell-based vehicles are superior delivery systems for their engineering feasibility and versatile delivery ability of chemicals, proteins, and all kinds of nanoparticles.

                            "Nanomedicine and nano delivery systems are a relatively new but rapidly developing science where materials in the nanoscale range are employed to serve as means of diagnostic tools or to deliver therapeutic agents to specific targeted sites in a controlled manner. Nanotechnology offers multiple benefits in treating chronic human diseases by site-specific, and target-oriented delivery of precise medicines. Recently, there are a number of outstanding applications of the nanomedicine (chemotherapeutic agents, biological agents, immunotherapeutic agents etc.) in the treatment of various diseases. The current review, presents an updated summary of recent advances in the field of nanomedicines and nano based drug delivery systems through comprehensive scrutiny of the discovery and application of nanomaterials in improving both the efficacy of novel and old drugs (e.g., natural products) and selective diagnosis through disease marker molecules. The opportunities and challenges of nanomedicines in drug delivery from synthetic/natural sources to their clinical applications are also discussed. In addition, we have included information regarding the trends and perspectives in nanomedicine area."

                            "Abstract Brain drug delivery remains a major difficulty for several challenges including the blood\u2013brain barrier, lesion spot targeting, and stability during circulation. Blood cells including erythrocytes, platelets, and various subpopulations of leukocytes have distinct features such as long-circulation, natural targeting, and chemotaxis. The development of biomimetic drug delivery systems based on blood cells for brain drug delivery is growing fast by using living cells, membrane coating nanotechnology, or cell membrane-derived nanovesicles. Blood cell-based vehicles are superior delivery systems for their engineering feasibility and versatile delivery ability of chemicals, proteins, and all kinds of nanoparticles. Here, we focus on advances of blood cell-based biomimetic carriers for from blood to brain drug delivery and discuss their translational challenges in the future."

                            "The efficacy of therapeutics for brain tumors is seriously hampered by multiple barriers to drug delivery, including severe destabilizing effects in the blood circulation, the blood\u2013brain barrier/blood\u2013brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB), and limited tumor uptake. Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK\u2010NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4\u2010carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH\u2010responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ. STICK\u2010NPs exhibit prolonged circulation time (17\u2010fold higher area under curve) than the free agent, allowing increased opportunities to transpass the BBB/BBTB via glucose\u2010transporter\u2010mediated transcytosis by MA. The tumor acidic environment then triggers the transformation of the STICK\u2010NPs into smaller nanoparticles and reveals a secondary CBA targeting moiety for deep tumor penetration and enhanced uptake in tumor cells. STICK\u2010NPs significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive and chemoresistant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. This formulation tackles multiple physiological barriers on\u2010demand with a simple and smart STICK design. Therefore, these features allow STICK\u2010NPs to unleash the potential of brain tumor therapeutics to improve their treatment efficacy."

                            "The development of neuropharmaceutical gene delivery systems requires strategies to obtain efficient and effective brain targeting as well as blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. A brain-targeted gene delivery system based on a transferrin (Tf) and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) dual-functionalized liposome, CPP-Tf-liposome, was designed and investigated for crossing BBB and permeating into the brain. We selected three sequences of CPPs [melittin, Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (kFGF), and penetration accelerating sequence\u2013R8] and compared their ability to internalize into the cells and, subsequently, improve the transfection efficiency. Study of intracellular uptake indicated that liposomal penetration into bEnd.3 cells, primary astrocytes, and primary neurons occurred through multiple endocytosis pathways and surface modification with Tf and CPP enhanced the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles. A coculture in vitro BBB model reproducing the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the biologic barrier was developed to characterize the penetrating properties of these designed liposomes. The dual-functionalized liposomes effectively crossed the in vitro barrier model followed by transfecting primary neurons. Liposome tissue distribution in vivo indicated superior ability of kFGF-Tf-liposomes to overcome BBB and reach brain of the mice after single intravenous administration. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using strategically designed liposomes by combining Tf receptor targeting with enhanced cell penetration as a potential brain gene delivery vector. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rational synthesis of efficient brain-targeted gene carrier included modification of liposomes with a target-specific ligand, transferrin, and with cell-penetrating peptide to enhance cellular internalization. Our study used an in vitro triple coculture blood-brain barrier (BBB) model as a tool to characterize the permeability across BBB and functionality of designed liposomes prior to in vivo biodistribution studies. Our study demonstrated that rational design and characterization of BBB permeability are efficient strategies for development of brain-targeted gene carriers."

In this study, quercetin, a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, was encapsulated in human serum albumin to obtain HSA@QC nanoparticles (HQ NPs) as a natural phyto-antioxidant albumin nanoagent for the treatment of advanced AD. HQ NPs showed excellent antioxidant effects and protected PC12 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage. The intranasal administration of HQ NPs in 11-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which represented advanced AD, effectively prevented the loss of body weight, increased survival rates, and significantly reduced oxidative stress, A\u03b2 aggregation, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic damage in the brain. It also ultimately reversed severely impaired cognitive function. In addition to their favorable anti-AD effects, HQ NPs exhibited excellent biosafety and biocompatibility owing to their natural composition and are expected to become an ideal choice for future drug development and clinical applications."

                            "Amyloid \u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaques of amyloid \u03b2 play a pivotal role in affecting cognitive functions and memory. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide. Several treatment strategies focusing on the amyloid cascade have been implemented to treat AD. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses the main obstructive barrier by refraining drugs from penetrating the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising research field for brain drug delivery using nanosized particles. Zebrafish is emerging as a model of interest to elaborate on brain targeting and nanotechnology-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we have synthesized and characterized chrysin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Chr-Chi NPs) and evaluated them for neuroprotection against amyloid-\u03b2-induced toxicity. We find that treatment with Chr-Chi NPs helps to retain memory, cognition, and synaptic connections, which are otherwise compromised due to A\u03b21-42 toxicity. The NPs further help in reducing aggregates of amyloid \u03b2, thus decreasing neuronal death and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, our study brings to light a novel strategy for treating AD by a combined action on the neurons and amyloid aggregates mediated by chrysin and chitosan, respectively. Chr-Chi NPs, therefore, have the potential to provide a beneficial combinatorial treatment strategy for AD."

                            "Nutrient transporters have been explored for biomimetic delivery targeting the brain. The albumin-binding proteins (e.g., SPARC and gp60) are overexpressed in many tumors for transport of albumin as an amino acid and an energy source for fast-growing cancer cells. However, their application in brain delivery has rarely been investigated. In this work, SPARC and gp60 overexpression was found on glioma and tumor vessel endothelium; therefore, such pathways were explored for use in brain-targeting biomimetic delivery. We developed a green method for blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating albumin nanoparticle synthesis, with the capacity to coencapsulate different drugs and no need for cross-linkers. The hydrophobic drugs (i.e., paclitaxel and fenretinide) yield synergistic effects to induce albumin self-assembly, forming dual drug-loaded nanoparticles. The albumin nanoparticles can penetrate the BBB and target glioma cells via the mechanisms of SPARC- and gp60-mediated biomimetic transport. Importantly, by modification with the cell-penetrating peptide LMWP, the albumin nanoparticles display enhanced BBB penetration, intratumoral infiltration, and cellular uptake. The LMWP-modified nanoparticles exhibited improved treatment outcomes in both subcutaneous and intracranial glioma models, with reduced toxic side effects. The therapeutic mechanisms were associated with induction of apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, and tumor immune microenvironment regulation. It provides a facile method for dual drug-loaded albumin nanoparticle preparation and a promising avenue for biomimetic delivery targeting the brain tumor based on combination therapy."

                            "Detailed study of the molecular mechanism behind the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD) suggests that polyglutamine aggregation is one of the fundamental reasons for HD. Despite the discovery of many potential molecules, HD therapy is still limited to symptomatic relief. Among these molecules, few mechanism based peptide inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation (QBP1, NT17 and PGQ9P2) have shown promising activity; however, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low bioavailability, and low half-life may hinder their therapeutic potential. Hence, to deliver them to the brain for assessing their efficacy, we have designed and synthesized peptide loaded poly-d,l-lactide- co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles of less than 200 nm in size by carbodiimide chemistry and nanoprecipitation protocols. For brain delivery, PLGA nanoparticles were coated with polysorbate 80 which aids receptor mediated internalization. Using the in vitro BBB model of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and healthy mice, the translocation of polysorbate 80 coated fluorescent nanoparticles was confirmed. Moreover, QBP1, NT17, and PGQ9P2 loaded PLGA nanoparticles showed dose dependent inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation in cell models of HD (Neuro 2A and PC12 cells) and improved motor performance in Drosophila model of HD. Additionally, no toxicity in cells and animals confirmed biocompatibility of the nanoparticulate formulations. Based on this work, future studies can be designed in higher animal models to test peptide loaded nanoparticles in HD and other polyglutamine expansion related diseases."

                            "Drug delivery to the brain is hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which excludes most molecules from freely diffusing into the brain, and tightly regulates the active transport mechanisms that ensure sufficient delivery of nutrients to the brain parenchyma. Harnessing the possibility of delivering neuroactive drugs by way of receptors already present on the brain endothelium has been of interest for many years. The transferrin receptor is of special interest since its expression is limited to the endothelium of the brain as opposed to peripheral endothelium. Here, we investigate the possibility of delivering immunoliposomes and their encapsulated cargo to the brain via targeting of the transferrin receptor. We find that transferrin receptor-targeting increases the association between the immunoliposomes and primary endothelial cells in vitro, but that this does not correlate with increased cargo transcytosis. Furthermore, we show that the transferrin receptor-targeted immunoliposomes accumulate along the microvessels of the brains of rats, but find no evidence for transcytosis of the immunoliposome. Conversely, the increased accumulation correlated both with increased cargo uptake in the brain endothelium and subsequent cargo transport into the brain. These findings suggest that transferrin receptor-targeting is a relevant strategy of increasing drug exposure to the brain."
