To resolve this, Vilaseca et al. developed CG models of HSA, FG, and IgG as simple shapes, and showed that small (HSA) and large (FG) proteins do not compete with each other, but rather compete with others (IgG) in a cooperative way, which supports the Vroman effect [59]. Vilanova et al. also developed CG models for protein-silica NP and protein-protein interactions, showing that three-body interactions can be applied to capture the kinetics of the competitive adsorption of plasma proteins, such as HSA, TF, and FG, which successfully reproduces the experimental observation regarding the replacement of abundant proteins (HSA and TF) with high-affinity proteins (FG) at the early stage of corona formation (Figure 8) [60]. In particular, the adsorption kinetics and compositions of HSA, TF, and FG agree with the experimental results, showing the ability of the CG model (three-body interaction) to predict the kinetics and composition of protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces [60]. Tavanti et al. performed CG simulations of multiple insulin and FG molecules that were adsorbed onto 5 nm-sized citrate-capped AuNPs, and showed that 20 insulin and three FG molecules bind to the AuNP surface, indicating the difference of their binding affinity [61]. In particular, insulin has the specific binding site, while FG has various binding sites, depending on the protein concentration and composition [61]. The presence of FG induces less adsorption of insulin, showing the adsorption competition between insulin and FG [61].",

As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

                    "text": "Nanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery and antitumor therapeutics [1][2][3][4][5]. Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.",

However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins, leading to the formation of protein layers on the nanoparticle surface, called protein corona. Experiments have shown that protein corona modulates nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties and, thus, influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, which can increases or decreases the delivery efficiency. To complement these experimental findings and understand atomic-level phenomena that cannot be captured by experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed for the past decade. Here, we aim to review the critical role of MD simulations to understand (1) the conformation, binding site, and strength of plasma proteins that are adsorbed onto nanoparticle surfaces, (2) the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on nanoparticle surfaces, and (3) the interactions between protein-coated nanoparticles and cell membranes. MD simulations have successfully predicted the competitive binding and conformation of protein corona and its effect on the nanoparticle\u2013nanoparticle and nanoparticle\u2013membrane interactions. In particular, simulations have uncovered the mechanism regarding the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins, which helps to explain the Vroman effect. Overall, these findings indicate that simulations can now provide predications in excellent agreement with experimental observations as well as atomic-scale insights into protein corona formation and interactions.\n## Introduction\nNanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery and antitumor therapeutics [1][2][3][4][5]. Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.\n\n## Competitive Adsorption and Desorption of Plasma Proteins on Nanoparticle Surfaces\nExperimental and theoretical studies have shown that, when plasma proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle and form protein layers that are composed of hard (inner) and soft (outer) corona, abundant plasma proteins first bind to the nanoparticle surface, and they they are then replaced by high-affinity proteins via the adsorption competition between proteins, called the Vroman effect [58], although this mechanism has not been well interpreted at the atomic level. To resolve this, Vilaseca et al. developed CG models of HSA, FG, and IgG as simple shapes, and showed that small (HSA) and large (FG) proteins do not compete with each other, but rather compete with others (IgG) in a cooperative way, which supports the Vroman effect [59]. Vilanova et al. also developed CG models for protein-silica NP and protein-protein interactions, showing that three-body interactions can be applied to capture the kinetics of the competitive adsorption of plasma proteins, such as HSA, TF, and FG, which successfully reproduces the experimental observation regarding the replacement of abundant proteins (HSA and TF) with high-affinity proteins (FG) at the early stage of corona formation (Figure 8) [60]. In particular, the adsorption kinetics and compositions of HSA, TF, and FG agree with the experimental results, showing the ability of the CG model (three-body interaction) to predict the kinetics and composition of protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces [60]. Tavanti et al. performed CG simulations of multiple insulin and FG molecules that were adsorbed onto 5 nm-sized citrate-capped AuNPs, and showed that 20 insulin and three FG molecules bind to the AuNP surface, indicating the difference of their binding affinity [61]. In particular, insulin has the specific binding site, while FG has various binding sites, depending on the protein concentration and composition [61]. The presence of FG induces less adsorption of insulin, showing the adsorption competition between insulin and FG [61].\n\n## Conclusions\nThe experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

While we have discussed first mechanistic insights in this review, further work along these lines is needed in order to understand molecular mechanisms and to identify the NP-related parameters governing this behavior. Not only the efficiency of the corona formation but possible individual proteins contribution to interparticle-bridging and denaturation of proteins may be decisive factors in this respect. We have discussed recent advances showing that protein adsorption can indeed be validly described as an equilibrium process but we point out that this may strongly depend on the properties of the NP surface and also on the individual properties of different proteins. It remains a focus of current research in this context to identify the possible parameters, conditions and forces that may cause deviations from a pure equilibrium or lead to kinetic hindrance on specific NP surfaces. \n\nSize alone and, hence, surface curvature has been identified as one factor governing the composition of the protein corona under physiological conditions [8]. While the mechanistic aspects of this finding remain unclear on a molecular scale, the biological implications may be dramatic. As discussed here, recent findings show that the interaction between corona carrying NPs and the cellular plasma membrane plays a central role for cellular uptake [4]. Moreover, it has been suggested that smaller NPs need to exceed a critical threshold concentration on the plasma membrane before the internalization process is triggered [170]. Understanding the role of the physiological protein corona and its NP-size dependent composition will clearly be an important aspect of future work in this area. \n\nThe individual contribution of functional groups within proteins has received some attention and a central aspect along these lines will be our understanding of the relation between the affinity of individual groups to the NP surface and the affinity of the protein, which is additionally governed by avidity effects. This remains a formidable task, since so many factors, including protein unfolding, entropic effects and effects related to the competitiveness of protein adsorption add further complexity to this issue under physiological conditions.",

Treuel, D. Docter, M. Maskos, R. Stauber\n## Abstract\nIn biological environments, nanoparticles are enshrouded by a layer of biomolecules, predominantly proteins, mediating its subsequent interactions with cells. Detecting this protein corona, understanding its formation with regards to nanoparticle (NP) and protein properties, and elucidating its biological implications were central aims of bio-related nano-research throughout the past years. Here, we discuss the mechanistic parameters that are involved in the protein corona formation and the consequences of this corona formation for both, the particle, and the protein. We review consequences of corona formation for colloidal stability and discuss the role of functional groups and NP surface functionalities in shaping NP\u2013protein interactions. We also elaborate the recent advances demonstrating the strong involvement of Coulomb-type interactions between NPs and charged patches on the protein surface. Moreover, we discuss novel aspects related to the complexity of the protein corona forming under physiological conditions in full serum. Specifically, we address the relation between particle size and corona composition and the latest findings that help to shed light on temporal evolution of the full serum corona for the first time. Finally, we discuss the most recent advances regarding the molecular-scale mechanistic role of the protein corona in cellular uptake of NPs.\n## Conclusion\nSignificant progress has been made towards understanding the protein corona formation around NPs, yet, the current state of knowledge clearly emphasizes the continuous need for further molecular-scale studies of protein adsorption to engineered NPs. \n\nThe effect of protein corona formation on colloidal stability has been investigated and remains a very relevant problem for any studies under physiological conditions. While we have discussed first mechanistic insights in this review, further work along these lines is needed in order to understand molecular mechanisms and to identify the NP-related parameters governing this behavior. Not only the efficiency of the corona formation but possible individual proteins contribution to interparticle-bridging and denaturation of proteins may be decisive factors in this respect. We have discussed recent advances showing that protein adsorption can indeed be validly described as an equilibrium process but we point out that this may strongly depend on the properties of the NP surface and also on the individual properties of different proteins. It remains a focus of current research in this context to identify the possible parameters, conditions and forces that may cause deviations from a pure equilibrium or lead to kinetic hindrance on specific NP surfaces. \n\nSize alone and, hence, surface curvature has been identified as one factor governing the composition of the protein corona under physiological conditions [8]. While the mechanistic aspects of this finding remain unclear on a molecular scale, the biological implications may be dramatic. As discussed here, recent findings show that the interaction between corona carrying NPs and the cellular plasma membrane plays a central role for cellular uptake [4]. Moreover, it has been suggested that smaller NPs need to exceed a critical threshold concentration on the plasma membrane before the internalization process is triggered [170]. Understanding the role of the physiological protein corona and its NP-size dependent composition will clearly be an important aspect of future work in this area. \n\nThe individual contribution of functional groups within proteins has received some attention and a central aspect along these lines will be our understanding of the relation between the affinity of individual groups to the NP surface and the affinity of the protein, which is additionally governed by avidity effects. This remains a formidable task, since so many factors, including protein unfolding, entropic effects and effects related to the competitiveness of protein adsorption add further complexity to this issue under physiological conditions.",

                    "text": "Natural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.\n## Introduction\nNatural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities [31]. Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers [77] showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa [78,79]. At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake), see Figure 5    As the PEG density increases, fewer proteins are adsorbed.

One of the main strategies to reduce the formation of the corona has featured the functionalization of particles with hydrophilic ligands and coatings (Amoozgar & Yeo, 2012;Ke et al., 2017;Rampado et al., 2020). Functionalization with hydrophilic motifs promotes the formation of hydration shells, thus making the NP surface less available for interactions with proteins and other biomolecules. Among the potential ligands, PEG is certainly the most well-known and used surface motif. Although PEG chains reduce NP-protein interactions thanks to their hydrophilic character, other properties such as polymer chain length and density on the particle surface have also been found to play an important role. The effect of coating poly(lactic acid) (PLA) NPs with PEG ligands ranging from 2 to 20 kDa on PC formation was reported over two decades ago (Gref et al., 2000). A strong decrease in protein adsorption was initially observed when particles were functionalized with PEG ranging between 2 and 5 kDa. Only a small reduction was then seen for PEG chains longer than 5 kDa, suggesting that the optimum NP coverage had been reached at 5 kDa. In a different study, polymeric micelles coated with PEG ligands and incubated in whole human blood showed a progressive inhibition of PC formation when PEG size increased from 5 to 20 kDa, indicating that the increase in molecular weight of the PEG chains results in a decrease in the formation of PC (Miteva et al., 2015). Interestingly, the two studies also indicate that for different particles systems, the optimal length of the PEG chains might have to be tailored. Nevertheless, coating of NPs with PEG does not always reduce the PC formation efficiently. As described by Seneca et al., the amount of proteins adsorbed on PEGylated NPs varied significantly depending on the density of the PEG chains present on the surface (Seneca et al., 2018).",

Although PEG chains reduce NP-protein interactions thanks to their hydrophilic character, other properties such as polymer chain length and density on the particle surface have also been found to play an important role. The effect of coating poly(lactic acid) (PLA) NPs with PEG ligands ranging from 2 to 20 kDa on PC formation was reported over two decades ago (Gref et al., 2000). A strong decrease in protein adsorption was initially observed when particles were functionalized with PEG ranging between 2 and 5 kDa. Only a small reduction was then seen for PEG chains longer than 5 kDa, suggesting that the optimum NP coverage had been reached at 5 kDa. In a different study, polymeric micelles coated with PEG ligands and incubated in whole human blood showed a progressive inhibition of PC formation when PEG size increased from 5 to 20 kDa, indicating that the increase in molecular weight of the PEG chains results in a decrease in the formation of PC (Miteva et al., 2015). Interestingly, the two studies also indicate that for different particles systems, the optimal length of the PEG chains might have to be tailored. Nevertheless, coating of NPs with PEG does not always reduce the PC formation efficiently. As described by Seneca et al., the amount of proteins adsorbed on PEGylated NPs varied significantly depending on the density of the PEG chains present on the surface (Seneca et al., 2018).",

Stravalaci, F. Re, D. Moscatelli, P. Bigini, M. Salmona, M. Gobbi\n## Abstract\nGreat interest is currently being devoted to the development of nanoparticles (NPs) for biomedical purposes, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of their cargos (either imaging probes or drugs) and to enhance the specific targeting at the disease site. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), widely used for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, represents a technique of choice for rapid and quantitative analyses of the interaction between NPs\u2014functionalized with specific ligands\u2014and their putative biological targets. Moreover, SPR can provide important details on the formation and the role of the protein \u201ccorona\u201d, i.e., the protein layer which coats NPs once they come into contact with biological fluids. These novel applications of SPR sensors may be very useful to characterize, screen and develop nanodevices for biomedical purposes.\n## SPR for Investigating Protein Corona\nWhen NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface [7,8].The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,7].\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) [5,30,[35][36][37] and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) [7,35,38].The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface [30,39,40].For example, experimental data [41] and the results of a simulation model [40] suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8,36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety.",

Zou, Jing Zhang, Longmin Chen, Qianqian Xu, Sheng Yao, Hong Chen\n## Abstract\nNeuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is a primary characteristic of CNS diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and mental disorders. The excessive activation of immune cells results in the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently induce neuronal death and accelerate the progression of neurodegeneration. Therefore, mitigating excessive neuroinflammation has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of CNS diseases. Despite advancements in drug discovery and the development of novel therapeutics, the effective delivery of these agents to the CNS remains a serious challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). This underscores the need to develop a novel drug delivery system. Recent studies have identified oral lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a promising approach to efficiently deliver drugs across the BBB and treat neurological diseases. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the recent advancements in the development of LNPs designed for the controlled delivery and therapeutic modulation of CNS diseases through oral administration. Furthermore, this review addresses the mechanisms by which these LNPs overcome biological barriers and evaluate their clinical implications and therapeutic efficacy in the context of oral drug delivery systems. Specifically, it focuses on LNP formulations that facilitate oral administration, exploring their potential to enhance bioavailability, improve targeting precision, and alleviate or manage the symptoms associated with a range of CNS diseases.\n## Systemic Circulation\nLNPs possess high free energy due to their small size and large surface area, which promotes their interactions with biological macromolecules in biological fluids. Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

Among label free techniques, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensing is a versatile tool to study LNPs in the field of nanotherapeutics research. SPR, widely used for the analysis of molecular interactions, is based on the immobilization of one of the interacting partners to the sensor surface, which can be easily achieved in the case of LNPs by hydrophobic attachment onto commercial lipid- capture sensor chips. In the last years SPR technology has emerged as an interesting strategy for studying molecular aspects of drug delivery that determines the efficacy of the nanotherapeutical such as LNPs' interactions with biological targets, with serum proteins and with tumor extracelullar matrix. Moreover, SPR has contributed to the obtention and characterization of LNPs, gathering information about the interplay between components of the formulations, their response to organic molecules and, more recently, the quantification and molecular characterization of exosomes. By the combination of available sensor platforms, assay quickness and straight forward platform adaptation for new carrier systems, SPR is becoming a high throughput technique for LNPs' characterization and analysis.",

SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

Y. Chain, M. A. Daza Millone, J. S. Cisneros, E. A. Ram\u00edrez, M. E. Vela\n## Abstract\nThe development of drug carriers based in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) aims toward the synthesis of non-toxic multifunctional nanovehicles that can bypass the immune system and allow specific site targeting, controlled release and complete degradation of the carrier components. Among label free techniques, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensing is a versatile tool to study LNPs in the field of nanotherapeutics research. SPR, widely used for the analysis of molecular interactions, is based on the immobilization of one of the interacting partners to the sensor surface, which can be easily achieved in the case of LNPs by hydrophobic attachment onto commercial lipid- capture sensor chips. In the last years SPR technology has emerged as an interesting strategy for studying molecular aspects of drug delivery that determines the efficacy of the nanotherapeutical such as LNPs' interactions with biological targets, with serum proteins and with tumor extracelullar matrix. Moreover, SPR has contributed to the obtention and characterization of LNPs, gathering information about the interplay between components of the formulations, their response to organic molecules and, more recently, the quantification and molecular characterization of exosomes. By the combination of available sensor platforms, assay quickness and straight forward platform adaptation for new carrier systems, SPR is becoming a high throughput technique for LNPs' characterization and analysis.\n## Interaction With Serum Proteins\nIt is well-known that the interaction of drug nanocarriers with serum proteins can alter the pharmacokinetics of the nanovehicles either affecting the cellular uptake or the clearance of the particles by the immune system (Pearson et al., 2014). SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

            "abstract": "Chitosan is a polymer that is extensively used to prepare nanoparticles (NPs) with tailored properties for applications in many fields of human activities. Among them, targeted drug delivery, especially when cancer therapy is the main interest, is a major application of chitosan-based NPs. Due to its positive charges, chitosan is used to produce the core of the NPs or to cover NPs made from other types of polymers, both strategies aiming to protect the carried drug until NPs reach the target sites and to facilitate the uptake and drug delivery into these cells. A major challenge in the design of these chitosan-based NPs is the formation of a protein corona (PC) upon contact with biological fluids. The composition of the PC can, to some extent, be modulated depending on the size, shape, electrical charge and hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the NPs. According to the composition of the biological fluids that have to be crossed during the journey of the drug-loaded NPs towards the target cells, the surface of these particles can be changed by covering their core with various types of polymers or with functionalized polymers carrying some special molecules, that will preferentially adsorb some proteins in their PC. The PC\u2019s composition may change by continuous processes of adsorption and desorption, depending on the affinity of these proteins for the chemical structure of the surface of NPs. Beside these, in designing the targeted drug delivery NPs one can take into account their toxicity, initiation of an immune response, participation (enhancement or inhibition) in certain metabolic pathways or chemical processes like reactive oxygen species, type of endocytosis of target cells, and many others. There are cases in which these processes seem to require antagonistic properties of nanoparticles. Products that show good behavior in cell cultures may lead to poor in vivo results, when the composition of the formed PC is totally different. This paper reviews the physico-chemical properties, cellular uptake and drug delivery applications of chitosan-based nanoparticles, specifying the factors that contribute to the success of the targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, we highlight the role of the protein corona formed around the NP in its intercellular fate.",

Moraru, Manuela Maria Mincea, Gheorghi\u021ba Menghiu, V. Ostafe\n## Abstract\nChitosan is a polymer that is extensively used to prepare nanoparticles (NPs) with tailored properties for applications in many fields of human activities. Among them, targeted drug delivery, especially when cancer therapy is the main interest, is a major application of chitosan-based NPs. Due to its positive charges, chitosan is used to produce the core of the NPs or to cover NPs made from other types of polymers, both strategies aiming to protect the carried drug until NPs reach the target sites and to facilitate the uptake and drug delivery into these cells. A major challenge in the design of these chitosan-based NPs is the formation of a protein corona (PC) upon contact with biological fluids. The composition of the PC can, to some extent, be modulated depending on the size, shape, electrical charge and hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the NPs. According to the composition of the biological fluids that have to be crossed during the journey of the drug-loaded NPs towards the target cells, the surface of these particles can be changed by covering their core with various types of polymers or with functionalized polymers carrying some special molecules, that will preferentially adsorb some proteins in their PC. The PC\u2019s composition may change by continuous processes of adsorption and desorption, depending on the affinity of these proteins for the chemical structure of the surface of NPs. Beside these, in designing the targeted drug delivery NPs one can take into account their toxicity, initiation of an immune response, participation (enhancement or inhibition) in certain metabolic pathways or chemical processes like reactive oxygen species, type of endocytosis of target cells, and many others. There are cases in which these processes seem to require antagonistic properties of nanoparticles. Products that show good behavior in cell cultures may lead to poor in vivo results, when the composition of the formed PC is totally different. This paper reviews the physico-chemical properties, cellular uptake and drug delivery applications of chitosan-based nanoparticles, specifying the factors that contribute to the success of the targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, we highlight the role of the protein corona formed around the NP in its intercellular fate.\n## Protein Corona\nNanoparticles entering a biological environment undergo surface modification owing to dynamic physicochemical interactions with proteins and other biomolecules in the extracellular fluids.The adsorption of plasma proteins, lipids and other molecules on the surface of NPs leads to the formation of a stratum of these molecules, commonly called 'protein corona' (PC), as the majority of the adsorbed molecules are proteins [21,22] (see Figure 1).The chemical structure of the PC and the kinetics of changes of its configuration depend on the affinities of proteins towards the functional groups located on the surface of NPs, but also on the proteins' concentration.Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23] (see Figure 2).In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate.The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer.The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface.These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low.Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible.Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place.As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24].There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25,26].\n\nThe thickness of the \"hard\" and \"soft\" protein corona layers depends on particle size, surface properties, but also on protein concentration and composition.",

The processes occurring during formation of this interfacial layer are exceedingly complicated, however, and even fundamental issues are still under debate. \n\nThe physical nature of the protein corona is largely governed by the (surface) properties of the NPs and by the types and (relative) amounts of biomolecules (and their individual properties) present in the biofluid [13e16]. Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment [21]. The physicochemical properties of the NP surfaces greatly affect protein adsorption and thereby control the properties of the biomolecular corona, which mediates the interaction between nanomaterials and the biological environment. The physical nature of the corona depends on the detailed history of the biofluid exposure (e.g. in vitro vs. in vivo), the type of organism and even the health status of a patient. \n\nMany useful reviews have appeared in recent times addressing NPs for biomedical applications and the implications of protein corona formation for NP engineering [12,22e27]. Here we have not aimed at contributing yet another exhaustive review. We instead focus on three different areas that deem particularly important for further advancement of NPs for biomedical applications. After a brief sketch introducing important aspects of the protein corona, we first address fundamental physicochemical issues of protein corona formation, which have been explored in in-vitro studies, with a special focus on the underlying mechanistic details. Second, we present recent examples of how a molecular-scale understanding can be used to control the nature of the protein corona, enabling the engineering of NPs with advantageous properties for nanomedicine applications.",

Nienhaus, Haixia Wang, G. Nienhaus\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nAccordingly, any attempt to engineer NPs for biomedical applications must take this inevitable modification into account. The processes occurring during formation of this interfacial layer are exceedingly complicated, however, and even fundamental issues are still under debate. \n\nThe physical nature of the protein corona is largely governed by the (surface) properties of the NPs and by the types and (relative) amounts of biomolecules (and their individual properties) present in the biofluid [13e16]. Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment [21]. The physicochemical properties of the NP surfaces greatly affect protein adsorption and thereby control the properties of the biomolecular corona, which mediates the interaction between nanomaterials and the biological environment. The physical nature of the corona depends on the detailed history of the biofluid exposure (e.g. in vitro vs. in vivo), the type of organism and even the health status of a patient. \n\nMany useful reviews have appeared in recent times addressing NPs for biomedical applications and the implications of protein corona formation for NP engineering [12,22e27]. Here we have not aimed at contributing yet another exhaustive review. We instead focus on three different areas that deem particularly important for further advancement of NPs for biomedical applications. After a brief sketch introducing important aspects of the protein corona, we first address fundamental physicochemical issues of protein corona formation, which have been explored in in-vitro studies, with a special focus on the underlying mechanistic details. Second, we present recent examples of how a molecular-scale understanding can be used to control the nature of the protein corona, enabling the engineering of NPs with advantageous properties for nanomedicine applications.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.",

                    "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.\n## PEG Shedding\nThe PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration 60 , pH 61 , ionic strength 62 , temperature 63 and incubation time [64][65][66] . Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties 67 , targeting abilities 20,28,68 and biological responses 17,22,65,69 change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 . Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 . The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments 72 . \n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid 58,73,74 . The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces 57,60,64 .",

Landry, Anna Moore, Roxana Coreas\n## Abstract\nThe protein corona spontaneously develops and evolves on the surface of nanoscale materials when they are exposed to biological environments, altering their physiochemical properties and affecting their subsequent interactions with biosystems. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of protein corona research in nanomedicine. We next discuss remaining challenges in the research methodology and characterization of the protein corona that slow the development of nanoparticle therapeutics and diagnostics, and we address how artificial intelligence can advance protein corona research as a complement to experimental research efforts. We then review emerging opportunities provided by the protein corona to address major issues in healthcare and environmental sciences. This Review details how mechanistic insights into nanoparticle protein corona formation can broadly address unmet clinical and environmental needs, as well as enhance the safety and efficacy of nanobiotechnology products. Understanding the protein corona can advance nanomedicinal developments and elucidate how nanomaterials impact the environment. This Review discusses the evolution and challenges in characterizing the protein corona, explores how artificial intelligence can supplement experimental efforts and exposes emerging opportunities in nanomedicine and the environment.\n## Soft and hard coronas\nNPs possess unique physiochemical properties 56 , such as size 57,58 , shape 59 and surface chemistries 19,57,60 , that can affect the formation of the protein corona. Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration 60 , pH 61 , ionic strength 62 , temperature 63 and incubation time [64][65][66] . Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties 67 , targeting abilities 20,28,68 and biological responses 17,22,65,69 change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 . Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 . The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments 72 . \n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid 58,73,74 . The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces 57,60,64 .",

ONs are small (15\u201330 bp) nucleotide-based therapeutics which are capable of targeting DNA and RNA as well as other biomolecules. ONs can be subdivided into several classes based on their chemical modifications and on the mechanisms of their target interactions. Historically, the largest hindrance to the widespread usage of ON therapeutics has been their inability to effectively internalize into cells and escape from endosomes to reach their molecular targets in the cytosol or nucleus. While cell uptake has been improved, \u201cendosomal escape\u201d remains a significant problem. There are a range of approaches to overcome this, and in this review, we focus on three: altering the chemical structure of the ONs, formulating synthetic, lipid-based nanoparticles to encapsulate the ONs, or biologically loading the ONs into extracellular vesicles. This review provides a background to the design and mode of action of existing FDA-approved ONs. It presents the most common ON classifications and chemical modifications from a fundamental scientific perspective and provides a roadmap of the cellular uptake pathways by which ONs are trafficked. Finally, this review delves into each of the above-mentioned approaches to ON delivery, highlighting the scientific principles behind each and covering recent advances.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

El-Andaloussi\n## Abstract\nOligonucleotides (ONs) comprise a rapidly growing class of therapeutics. In recent years, the list of FDA-approved ON therapies has rapidly expanded. ONs are small (15\u201330 bp) nucleotide-based therapeutics which are capable of targeting DNA and RNA as well as other biomolecules. ONs can be subdivided into several classes based on their chemical modifications and on the mechanisms of their target interactions. Historically, the largest hindrance to the widespread usage of ON therapeutics has been their inability to effectively internalize into cells and escape from endosomes to reach their molecular targets in the cytosol or nucleus. While cell uptake has been improved, \u201cendosomal escape\u201d remains a significant problem. There are a range of approaches to overcome this, and in this review, we focus on three: altering the chemical structure of the ONs, formulating synthetic, lipid-based nanoparticles to encapsulate the ONs, or biologically loading the ONs into extracellular vesicles. This review provides a background to the design and mode of action of existing FDA-approved ONs. It presents the most common ON classifications and chemical modifications from a fundamental scientific perspective and provides a roadmap of the cellular uptake pathways by which ONs are trafficked. Finally, this review delves into each of the above-mentioned approaches to ON delivery, highlighting the scientific principles behind each and covering recent advances.\n## LIPID-BASED NANOPARTICLES FOR RNA DELIVERY\nitic cells. The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

Control over protein corona formation and composition is therefore therapeutically relevant and has historically been reduced through PEGylation to prevent nanoparticle clearance. Interestingly, PEG often comprises the entire surface of polymersomes due to its incorporation into the block copolymer, while the degree of PEGylation for liposomes is limited to low molecular ratios [79]. Consequently, the polymersome surface most likely constitutes of dense PEG chains in 'brush' conformation, which may result in a distinct biological identity compared to that of liposomes with PEG chains in a collapsed 'mushroom' state. Nevertheless, the biological identity of PEGbased polymersomes has not been fully elucidated yet and may also depend on interactions between physicochemical properties, including surface chemistry and functionalization. \n\nRecently, Scott and colleagues have made initial steps towards controlling the biological identity of PEG-based polymersomes. They screened a small library composed of PEG-PPS micelles, polymersomes and filomicelles functionalized with methoxy, hydroxy or phosphate end groups to study the effect of surface chemistry and morphology on protein corona formation and composition [80]. Protein corona quantification and identification via proteomics revealed that human plasma proteins most abundantly adsorb to negatively charged phosphate surfaces, whereas the relatively inert methoxy end group displayed very low protein adsorption. A more detailed investigation into the protein corona composition disclosed a complex interplay between surface chemistry and morphology, of which the former largely dictated nanoparticle immunogenicity (i.e. complement activation) and the latter determined uptake by cells of the MPS. This suggests that the morphology-dependent biodistribution described in the previous sections is at least partially explained by a difference in biological identity [80]. Remarkably, regardless of surface chemistry, polymersomes adsorbed the most proteins associated with clearance by the MPS. \n\nThese findings suggest that PEG-based polymersomes intrinsically show enhanced internalization by immune cells because of a certain protein corona composition. So, their biological identity Fig. 3. | Overview of polymersomes with surface functionalization applicable in cancer immunotherapy.",

Tel, Loai Abdelmohsen, J. V. van Hest\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Biological identity\nThe protein corona acquired by nanoparticles within the first few hours of injection largely dictates their biological identity and affects their performance [78]. Control over protein corona formation and composition is therefore therapeutically relevant and has historically been reduced through PEGylation to prevent nanoparticle clearance. Interestingly, PEG often comprises the entire surface of polymersomes due to its incorporation into the block copolymer, while the degree of PEGylation for liposomes is limited to low molecular ratios [79]. Consequently, the polymersome surface most likely constitutes of dense PEG chains in 'brush' conformation, which may result in a distinct biological identity compared to that of liposomes with PEG chains in a collapsed 'mushroom' state. Nevertheless, the biological identity of PEGbased polymersomes has not been fully elucidated yet and may also depend on interactions between physicochemical properties, including surface chemistry and functionalization. \n\nRecently, Scott and colleagues have made initial steps towards controlling the biological identity of PEG-based polymersomes. They screened a small library composed of PEG-PPS micelles, polymersomes and filomicelles functionalized with methoxy, hydroxy or phosphate end groups to study the effect of surface chemistry and morphology on protein corona formation and composition [80]. Protein corona quantification and identification via proteomics revealed that human plasma proteins most abundantly adsorb to negatively charged phosphate surfaces, whereas the relatively inert methoxy end group displayed very low protein adsorption. A more detailed investigation into the protein corona composition disclosed a complex interplay between surface chemistry and morphology, of which the former largely dictated nanoparticle immunogenicity (i.e. complement activation) and the latter determined uptake by cells of the MPS. This suggests that the morphology-dependent biodistribution described in the previous sections is at least partially explained by a difference in biological identity [80]. Remarkably, regardless of surface chemistry, polymersomes adsorbed the most proteins associated with clearance by the MPS. \n\nThese findings suggest that PEG-based polymersomes intrinsically show enhanced internalization by immune cells because of a certain protein corona composition. So, their biological identity Fig. 3. | Overview of polymersomes with surface functionalization applicable in cancer immunotherapy.",

The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

Dilliard, D. Siegwart\n## Abstract\nNucleic acids for gene silencing, expression and editing can precisely target disease at the molecular level but require effective delivery systems. This Review discusses the material and biological principles used to design delivery systems to target specific organs in the body. Genetic drugs based on nucleic acid biomolecules are a rapidly emerging class of medicines that directly reprogramme the central dogma of biology to prevent and treat disease. However, multiple biological barriers normally impede\u00a0the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids, necessitating the use of a delivery system. Lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent leading approaches for the clinical translation of genetic drugs. These systems circumnavigate biological barriers and facilitate the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids in the correct cells of the target organ using passive, active and endogenous targeting mechanisms. In this Review, we highlight the constituent materials of these advanced nanoparticles, their nucleic acid cargoes and how they journey through the body. We discuss targeting principles for liver delivery, as it is the organ most successfully targeted by intravenously administered nanoparticles to date, followed by the expansion of these concepts to extrahepatic (non-liver) delivery. Ultimately, this Review connects emerging materials and biological insights playing key roles in targeting specific organs and cells in vivo.\n## Review article\nof studies on nanoparticle organ targeting have focused on how plasma proteins impact delivery outcomes. The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

PEG also mediates stealth effects in vivo reducing serum protein adsorption and consequently resulting in a prolonged blood circulation time. These effects are dependent on the density and the molecular weight of the linear PEG [13] . \n\nSerum protein adsorption with formation of a protein corona occurs whenever NPs get into contact with biological fluids like blood, result-ing in a new NP biological identity [ 5 , 14 , 15 ]. Hence, blood circulation time, biodistribution and targeting of nanocarriers can be influenced. The NP characteristics like size, shape and surface composition, as well as environmental parameters like temperature and type of fluid can affect the composition of the protein corona [ 16 , 17 ]. Corona proteins can either act as opsonins and mark NPs for rapid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system or they act as dysopsonins mediating longer blood circulation times [18] . As PEG can reduce protein adsorption, but not completely prevent it, the formation of a protein corona around the NPs has to be considered for successful active targeting. \n\nThe aim of this study was on the one hand to analyze the effect of different PEG spacers with varying length for ligand coupling on active targeting.

Unfortunately, the potential therapeutic efficacy is not completely exploited, yet. This is mainly due to the fast clearance of the nanostructures in the body. Nanoparticles and the liver have a unique interaction because the liver represents one of the major barriers for drug delivery. This interaction becomes even more relevant and complex when the drug delivery strategies employing nanostructures are proposed for the therapy of liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this case, the selective delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles to the tumor microenvironment collides with the tendency of nanostructures to be quickly eliminated by the organ. The design of a new therapeutic approach based on nanoparticles to treat HCC has to particularly take into consideration passive and active mechanisms to avoid or delay liver elimination and to specifically address cancer cells or the cancer microenvironment. This review will analyze the different aspects concerning the dual role of the liver, both as an organ carrying out a clearance activity for the nanostructures and as target for therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment.",

Babo\u00e7i, S. Capolla, Federica Di Cintio, F. Colombo, P. Mauro, M. Dal Bo, M. Argenziano, R. Cavalli, G. Toffoli, P. Macor\n## Abstract\nThe development of nanostructures for therapeutic purpose is rapidly growing, following the results obtained in vivo in animal models and in the clinical trials. Unfortunately, the potential therapeutic efficacy is not completely exploited, yet. This is mainly due to the fast clearance of the nanostructures in the body. Nanoparticles and the liver have a unique interaction because the liver represents one of the major barriers for drug delivery. This interaction becomes even more relevant and complex when the drug delivery strategies employing nanostructures are proposed for the therapy of liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this case, the selective delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles to the tumor microenvironment collides with the tendency of nanostructures to be quickly eliminated by the organ. The design of a new therapeutic approach based on nanoparticles to treat HCC has to particularly take into consideration passive and active mechanisms to avoid or delay liver elimination and to specifically address cancer cells or the cancer microenvironment. This review will analyze the different aspects concerning the dual role of the liver, both as an organ carrying out a clearance activity for the nanostructures and as target for therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment.\n## Protein Corona and Macrophage Elimination\nWhen NPs are administered intravenously, they come in contact with a solution of thousands of proteins (62-84 g/L) that can be adsorbed on their surface conferring a new biological identity and influencing their clearance in vivo.\n\ne adsorption of serum proteins on NPs is termed \"opsonization\" and leads to the formation of a dynamic protein coat known as \"protein corona\" [43,44]. e protein corona is considered to be a continuous flux of desorption/ adsorption processes controlled by the so-called \"Vroman effect\": at any time, an initially attached protein can desorb from the NP surface and be replaced by a different one with higher affinity. is process changes the composition of the protein corona while the amount of adsorbed proteins remains relatively constant [45][46][47]. e generation of the protein corona is divided into two phases: initially, more abundant proteins, with low affinity, are rapidly adsorbed on NPs, and then, they are replaced by less abundant proteins but with higher affinity, until the corona reaches a stable composition. e latter type of proteins binds irreversibly to the NP surface within seconds or a minute constituting the \"hard corona\"; low affinity proteins with fast exchange rates interact with the hard corona components through proteinto-protein interactions constituting the \"soft corona\" [45,46,48]. e protein corona formation is related to the physicochemical properties (i.e., size, charge, shape, and surface composition) of NPs and the amount of proteins in the biological fluid [43,44] and can be considered unique for each nanomaterial. e protein corona contributes to NP clearance, circulation time, bioavailability, and toxicity, determining a different interaction with the cells in the body [43,44]. e protein corona plays a fundamental role in the biodistribution of NPs, and in particular, in the recognition by the MPS, especially through the adsorption of opsonins such as immunoglobulin G (IgG), coagulation proteins (i.e., fibrinogen), or complement components, which are believed to promote recognition by specific receptors on macrophage and phagocytosis [29,",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

                    "text": "Upon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

Mazumdar, Deepak Chitkara, A. Mittal\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Effect of protein corona\nUpon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

This assumption will be further verified by comparison with results of large scale molecular dynamics simulations for a few selected protein types and mean force potential calculations. From the typical protein concentrations and adsorption energies one can also predict the average content of the corona using ideal adsorbed solution theory [31]. It is important to understand that at this stage we would be able neither to scan all the plasma proteins nor to take into account any change of protein conformation or bonding between the adsorbed proteins. However, as the effect of the corona is still largely unknown, we can only hope to capture the most important contributions of the plasma protein to the NP dispersion stability and their interaction with the cell membrane. \n\nDue to complexity of blood plasma, we can only model it at a simplified level.

In this review, several critical aspects related to the protein corona are described, in particular which influences more specifically its formation, how to evaluate/characterize it, and what interactions to expect when the nanoparticle and the protein corona are inside the cell. Despite these issues, which have been studied in a gen- eral way, it has been verified that there\u2019s still much information missing when it comes to specific nanoparticles. Here, a few proteins are also highlighted as examples, which have been identified as part of the protein corona; in addition, several factors related to the formation of protein corona are discussed due to their important role in the different adsorbed proteins.",

The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

Emilio, M. \u00c1ngel, Gongora Rafael, Fuentes Manuel\n## Abstract\nThe protein corona is still somewhat of a mysterious consequence of the nanoparticles\u2019 application in theranostics. In this review, several critical aspects related to the protein corona are described, in particular which influences more specifically its formation, how to evaluate/characterize it, and what interactions to expect when the nanoparticle and the protein corona are inside the cell. Despite these issues, which have been studied in a gen- eral way, it has been verified that there\u2019s still much information missing when it comes to specific nanoparticles. Here, a few proteins are also highlighted as examples, which have been identified as part of the protein corona; in addition, several factors related to the formation of protein corona are discussed due to their important role in the different adsorbed proteins.\n## Introduction\nIt can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona. The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

Understanding the composition and kinetics of the PC at the molecular level is of considerable importance for controlling NP interaction with cells. Here, we present a systematic study of hard PC formation on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) coated with positively-charged polyethyleneimine (PEI) and negatively-charged poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) polymers in serum-supplemented cell culture medium. The rationale behind the choice of UCNP is two-fold: UCNP represents a convenient model of NP with a size ranging from 5 nm to >200 nm, while the unique photoluminescent properties of UCNP enable direct observation of the PC formation, which may provide new insight into this complex process. The non-linear optical properties of UCNP were utilised for direct observation of PC formation by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Our findings indicated that the charge of the surface polymer coating was the key factor for the formation of PC on UCNPs, with an ensuing effect on the NP\u2013cell interactions.",

The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC [20]. Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment [21]. The system of protein-modified NPs forms a unique biological identity of NPs that determines their interactions with biological systems. PCs are formed on most NPs regardless of their composition and surface properties, while NPs with profound antifouling properties and reduced adsorption of proteins are reportedly rare [22][23][24]. As a result, the physiochemical properties of NPs, such as size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and aggregation state, are altered dramatically. Accordingly, the biological properties of NPs in terms of toxicity, cellular recognition, cellular uptake, blood circulation lifetime, tumour accumulation, and biodistribution are also affected. For example, the PC has been shown to reduce NP adhesion to cell membrane and mitigate the associated cytotoxic effects, which the NP would otherwise exert [25][26][27]. The precoating of NPs with the most abundant plasma protein, albumin, has been demonstrated to halt further protein adsorption, decrease complement activation, prolong blood circulation time, and reduce NP toxicity [28,29].",

Liang, A. Everest\u2010Dass, A. Kostyuk, Z. Khabir, Run Zhang, D. Trushina, A. Zvyagin\n## Abstract\nApplications of nanoparticles (NPs) in the life sciences require control over their properties in protein-rich biological fluids, as an NP quickly acquires a layer of proteins on the surface, forming the so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d (PC). Understanding the composition and kinetics of the PC at the molecular level is of considerable importance for controlling NP interaction with cells. Here, we present a systematic study of hard PC formation on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) coated with positively-charged polyethyleneimine (PEI) and negatively-charged poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) polymers in serum-supplemented cell culture medium. The rationale behind the choice of UCNP is two-fold: UCNP represents a convenient model of NP with a size ranging from 5 nm to >200 nm, while the unique photoluminescent properties of UCNP enable direct observation of the PC formation, which may provide new insight into this complex process. The non-linear optical properties of UCNP were utilised for direct observation of PC formation by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Our findings indicated that the charge of the surface polymer coating was the key factor for the formation of PC on UCNPs, with an ensuing effect on the NP\u2013cell interactions.\n## Introduction\nIt has recently been recognised that NPs entering biological systems are quickly covered by biomolecules (e.g., plasma proteins) in order to form a protein corona (PC) layer [16,17]. \n\nBased on the affinity, binding, and dissociation rate, protein corona are classified into hard and soft PC [18,19]. The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC [20]. Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment [21]. The system of protein-modified NPs forms a unique biological identity of NPs that determines their interactions with biological systems. PCs are formed on most NPs regardless of their composition and surface properties, while NPs with profound antifouling properties and reduced adsorption of proteins are reportedly rare [22][23][24]. As a result, the physiochemical properties of NPs, such as size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and aggregation state, are altered dramatically. Accordingly, the biological properties of NPs in terms of toxicity, cellular recognition, cellular uptake, blood circulation lifetime, tumour accumulation, and biodistribution are also affected. For example, the PC has been shown to reduce NP adhesion to cell membrane and mitigate the associated cytotoxic effects, which the NP would otherwise exert [25][26][27]. The precoating of NPs with the most abundant plasma protein, albumin, has been demonstrated to halt further protein adsorption, decrease complement activation, prolong blood circulation time, and reduce NP toxicity [28,29].",

These include interaction with the proteins when AuNPs are exposed to biological fluids. When AuNPs are introduced into biological systems, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other biomolecules (like lipids) forming a tightly bound biomolecular (around 20-30 nm thick) corona, termed the protein corona (Figure 1) [49]. Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface [50,51]. The protein corona is made up of both hard and soft layers, depending on the affinity of the proteins for the nanoparticle surface. The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]. In recent decades many studies have tried to explain the protein corona formation [53,54]. According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface [55]. Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]. The resulting NPs coated by PC gain a new biological identity, and this corona is what is ultimately \"seen\" by cells. As a result of the PC layer the behaviors of NPs-interaction with a living system, such as cellular uptake, biodistribution, signaling, circulation lifetime and toxicity-can be modified [52,57].",

According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface [55]. Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]. The resulting NPs coated by PC gain a new biological identity, and this corona is what is ultimately \"seen\" by cells. As a result of the PC layer the behaviors of NPs-interaction with a living system, such as cellular uptake, biodistribution, signaling, circulation lifetime and toxicity-can be modified [52,57].",

As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al. 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al. 2013). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al. 2007a). In some cases, the protein corona may not fully saturate the surface area of nanoparticle and Fig. 3 Depending on the bio-corona composition, the same nanoparticle can develop immune patterns that sustain pro-or anti-tumoral activities instead bind at discreet sites, leaving much of NP surface unobstructed, which could also affect its toxicity (Rybak-Smith and Sim 2011). Bio-corona may extend the half-life of the NPs in systemic circulation by preventing the nonspecific uptake by cells of RES. Noteworthy, over seventy different serum proteins may heterogeneously be adsorbed to the surface of NPs. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of NP uptake by a macrophage cell (Walkey et al. 2012).",

Piperigkou, Konstantina Karamanou, A. Engin, A. Docea, C. Constantin, C. Negrei, D. Nikitovic, A. Tsatsakis\n## Abstract\nWith the expansion of the nanomedicine field, the knowledge focusing on the behavior of nanoparticles in the biological milieu has rapidly escalated. Upon introduction to a complex biological system, nanomaterials dynamically interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein \u201cbio-corona.\u201d The decoration with these surface biomolecules endows nanoparticles with new properties. The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons.\n## Bio-corona inducing innate immunity\nUnless they are specifically designed to avoid it, NPs are rapidly covered, in contact with biological fluids, by a selected group of biomolecules to form a corona that interacts with biological systems. As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al. 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al. 2013). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al. 2007a). In some cases, the protein corona may not fully saturate the surface area of nanoparticle and Fig. 3 Depending on the bio-corona composition, the same nanoparticle can develop immune patterns that sustain pro-or anti-tumoral activities instead bind at discreet sites, leaving much of NP surface unobstructed, which could also affect its toxicity (Rybak-Smith and Sim 2011). Bio-corona may extend the half-life of the NPs in systemic circulation by preventing the nonspecific uptake by cells of RES. Noteworthy, over seventy different serum proteins may heterogeneously be adsorbed to the surface of NPs. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of NP uptake by a macrophage cell (Walkey et al. 2012).",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

[17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

            "text": "Changes in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "Natural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

            "text": "Despite their clinical successes, our understanding of how and which biological components in complex biofluids, including blood, LNPs interact with, and the impact of such interactions on the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of LNP-based therapeutic products are still sparse and almost entirely limited to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE). To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

            "text": "Currently, the design of anticancer therapeutics is focused on creating new systems with low toxicity, e.g., those based on nanocarriers, enabling targeted delivery and high efficiency of the treatment [1]. Usually, it is assumed that immediately after being introduced into the blood, nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by plasma proteins that form a biological coating around the individual NPs, known as the protein corona [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Various characteristics of NPs (their size and shape, surface properties, etc.) have an influence on a formation mechanism of the protein corona [5,7]. In this respect, two categories of proteins can be distinguished: opsonins, which can increase the recognition of the reticuloendothelial system and, as a result, lead to a rapid elimination from the organism, and dysopsonins, which can improve the blood circulation time of NPs [9][10][11]. Therefore, when creating targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), knowledge about the protein-NP interaction mechanism can be crucial. \n\nUp until now, the formation of a protein corona was described for NPs based on polystyrene, gold, silica, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and was frequently used for masking other NPs [3,4,6,12]. Another way to increase the lifetime of NPs in the bloodstream is to create a particle with \"stealth\" properties. The \"stealth\" effect can be described as a phenomenon of preventing the adsorption of proteins onto NPs. It allows for prolonging blood clearance and reduces non-specific cellular uptake [2][3][4]. \n\nThe presence of strong or weak interactions between nanoparticles and proteins determines the possibility of the occurrence and the mechanism of the corona formation. The presence of a corona is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of a nanoparticle as a drug carrier [13].",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

In summary, the affinity of nanoparticles to biomolecules is determined by the contribution of multiple site of adsorption on the NPs surfaces (that are close to the amino-acids residues of the proteins), and the contribution of various forces that depend on the protein and the type of nanoparticles. Predicting this kind of interaction could be very helpful in nanomedicine to eliminate certain type of nanoparticles based on their relative nanodescriptors [4]. Another example of a mathematical model has been described by Dell'Orco et al. This model describes the kinetics formation of the protein corona around copolymer NPs. Three plasma proteins were used: albumin, fibrinogen and high density lipoprotein. This model tends to be used to predict protein corona formation on NPs with other biological fluids [5].\n\nFurthermore, the nanoparticles bound to protein can undergo dynamic changes as the particles enter onto or into cells. The NP-protein complex can persist in body fluids and cells from microseconds to days. As the environment of the NPs change while moving to another compartment or fluid, the composition of the protein corona is likely to also vary. It is interesting to note that high affinity proteins can displace the binding of low affinity proteins. G\u00f6ppert et al. studied the NP-plasma protein interaction using 2-D gels approaches and showed that the protein adsorption pattern on solid lipid NPs was dependent on contact time [6]. This study confirmed the Vroman effect [7] that explains the time evolution of the corona: proteins with high affinities but in low concentration in the plasma can displace highly concentrated proteins that have low affinity for the NPs. When using Nisopropylacrilamide/N-ter-butylacrylamide NPs as a model, human serum albumin (HAS) was rapidly adsorbed onto NPs but soon replaced by apolipoproteins such as AI AII AIV and AV. In addition, given the high number of protein on the plasma, the equilibrium of the corona formation will not be reached immediately. [8] Using Isothermal",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles' physicochemical properties control the formation and composition of the protein corona. Whereas the extent of the impact of each property on the protein corona composition and disposition is not completely understood, there is an extended consensus that no nanoparticle property alone drives the formation of the corona, but all of them together [23]. Nanoparticle protein adsorptions are mainly driven by non-covalent forces, affinity constants of proteins and protein structure thermodynamics [24]. Thus, the nanoparticle surface constitutes a major factor influencing the protein corona [25]. In contrast to the previously commented direct influence of nanoparticle surface charge in the toxicity and biodistribution of nanoparticles, this parameter does not seem to be so influential on the formation and eventual biological effect of NPPC [22,25]. \n\nThe hydrophobicity of a nanoparticle's surface is, on the contrary, a significant factor limiting the amount and identity of the proteins bound to the nanoparticle. In this regard, for instance, Lynch et al. found that when plasma is incubated with low hydrophobic copolymer particles, virtually no protein is retrieved, while significant amounts of protein are consistently bound to hydrophobic particles [26]. Nanoparticle surface chemistry is also a driving parameter in the formation of the characteristics of the protein corona, as it controls the number of possible binding sites [12]. Nanoparticles commonly need to be functionalized with ligands and biomolecules that affect their solubility, stability, and define and control their biocompatibility and biological interactions [27]. This functionalization eventually affects the formation of the protein corona (because it largely confers a stealth character on the nanoparticle, protecting it and making it inaccessible to proteins) and could be crucial when developing nanoparticles with biological or therapeutical applications [28].",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "A better understanding of the evolution of protein corona is explained by the dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) which combines the steric and electrostatic interactions. In addition to the classical diffusion-based Vroman effect, the non-monotonic adsorption pattern of corona formation is rather dependent on parameters such as adsorption energy, bulk density, and charge of the protein. It also suggests that inter-particle interaction can promote cooperative binding of proteins on the NPs surface and not just competitive binding. 24 6][27][28] The difference in the opinions is possibly due to the diversity of the experimental protocols in terms of variation in NPs, analytical methods, and choice of protein source. The principle of competitive displacement of proteins was not applicable and a stable protein composition throughout an extended period of 4 h was observed in the case of metal oxide NPs. 29 Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) studies conducted by Tenzer et al. also revealed that protein corona formation does not solely depend on the principles of the Vroman effect but instead complex interplay of multiple parameters determine the presence of any particular protein on the NPs surface. 30 The Vroman effect of time-bound protein displacement also does not apply to solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) incubated with dilute human plasma. 31 Oil-in-water emulsions and iron oxide NPs have also shown similar trends. 25,32 Table 2 summarizes a few of the studies wherein theories of protein coronation varied for different NPs. \n\nReporting a discrete mechanism of protein corona formation is a challenging task. A case-by-case approach is thus required to address the questions related to the formation of corona on NPs. The understanding of the interactive process would enable us to answer the vital questions regarding the biological response of these coronated NPs. Considering the inevitable nanobiointeractions it is necessary to tactfully work on the architectural framework of the NPs. Several reviews have summarized and categorized the varying nature of protein corona formation over a plethora of NPs and how it in\ue104uences the cellular interactions. 8,17,33",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

            "text": "PEG represents an ideal crosslinker for covalent attachment of targeting ligands because of the availability of many different end groups [12] . PEG also mediates stealth effects in vivo reducing serum protein adsorption and consequently resulting in a prolonged blood circulation time. These effects are dependent on the density and the molecular weight of the linear PEG [13] . \n\nSerum protein adsorption with formation of a protein corona occurs whenever NPs get into contact with biological fluids like blood, result-ing in a new NP biological identity [ 5 , 14 , 15 ]. Hence, blood circulation time, biodistribution and targeting of nanocarriers can be influenced. The NP characteristics like size, shape and surface composition, as well as environmental parameters like temperature and type of fluid can affect the composition of the protein corona [ 16 , 17 ]. Corona proteins can either act as opsonins and mark NPs for rapid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system or they act as dysopsonins mediating longer blood circulation times [18] . As PEG can reduce protein adsorption, but not completely prevent it, the formation of a protein corona around the NPs has to be considered for successful active targeting. \n\nThe aim of this study was on the one hand to analyze the effect of different PEG spacers with varying length for ligand coupling on active targeting. On the other hand, we aimed to characterize the protein corona formed around these NPs and its influence on the active targeting capability. We demonstrated that both serum protein adsorption and selection of the PEG spacer for the targeting moiety have an effect on active targeting and also influence each other.",

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

The competition and displacement steps for NPs surface are exhaustively studied for proteins (Hadjidemetriou and Kostarelos, 2017;Wheeler et al., 2021), and also reported for natural organic matter (NOM) (Xu et al., 2020). \n\n\u2022 The formation of biomolecular corona on NPs is shown to involve a combination of hydrodynamic, electrodynamic, electrostatic, steric, and bridging interactions.",

The formation of such a corona is important to consider, because in any imaginable way a nanoparticle would come in contact with the blood-brain barrier in vivo, it would do so in the presence of a complex mixture of biomolecules in its environment, all of which could potentially adsorb. Indeed, proteins, 49,51,52 lipids 53-56 and sugars 57,58 have all been found in the corona of different nanoparticles in animal-derived biological media, though the proteins are still the most studied. Furthermore, though which biomolecules adsorb differs, the same general phenomenon of a formation of corona is observed in many biological fluids, 59 from blood serum 50,52,60,61 to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 56 to urine. 59 For nanoparticles approaching the blood-brain barrier, the corona formed in blood serum is perhaps the most important (but not the only; see below) to consider, and this is also the most wellstudied.\n\nIt is a characteristic of the nanoscale, that the adsorption of biomolecules to nanoparticles can be so strong that (some of the) biomolecules will remain with the nanoparticle for much longer than it takes a cell to take up the nanoparticle. [61][62][63][64] This is particularly so for metal, 64 metal oxide 61,62 and other inorganic nanoparticles. 62,63 Still, biomolecular adsorption is sometimes also observed for nanoparticles intended as medicines, e.g., those with grafted ligands, even if PEGylated to prevent unspecific adsorption.

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

The molecular mechanism underlying the protein resistance of grafted with PEG are still not fully understood, 45 but a brush-induced steric repulsion preventing contact between proteins and the underlying surface, or the hydration shell surrounding PEG moieties, which suppresses adsorption of proteins, are considered as the two dominating mechanisms. 46 However, complete inhibition of corona formation remains a challenge, 47 as PEG chains on a nanoparticle's surface function as a waterbinding hydrogel-like brush, with protein-resistant properties that are highly dependent on the length, flexibility, and density of the PEG chains. 45 A recent class of nanoparticles has been fabricated by combining synthetic cores with a biologically derived membrane coating, including those derived from red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, white blood cells, cancer cells, and bacteria, has attracted attention. 48 ome of these cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles have a significant increase in their circulatory half-life, 48,49 or have the ability to better target a region of interest. 50 Each of these biomimetic nanoparticles has its own set of unique characteristics that are derived from the versatility and complexity of the cellular membrane used in their synthesis. 51,52 s a consequence, these biomimetic nanoparticles with natural surface properties are very different from synthetic nanoparticles that have a chemically modified surface, as the interface of biomimetic nanoparticles and biological systems that exist within the body is biocompatible including natural protein-protein interactions.",

            "text": "The fate of a nanoparticle, i.e., the biological area that it will target, is known to be dependent upon the nature of the particle itself, i.e., its hydrophobicity, size, radius of curvature, charge, coatings, etc. These factors influence the protein coating that is formed around nanoparticles when it enters a biological fluid. This coated-protein structure of nanoparticles is called a protein corona. The coated protein may undergo conformational change, leading to the exposure of new epitopes and altered function. Protein corona interacts with certain biological membranes while showing no interaction with certain other biological membranes. It shows specificity, thus determining the fate of nanoparticles. Protein binding to nanoparticles also helps to increase the dissolution rate of nanoparticles [47,48]. As depicted in Figure 1, a protein corona forms once nanoparticles are injected inside the body, where it interacts with serum biomolecules, especially protein. Highaffinity proteins bind tightly with the nanoparticle surface, forming a first layer of hard corona followed by the reversible adsorption of low-affinity protein, forming an additional layer of soft corona [49]. The nature of nanoparticles, such as size, charge, hydrophobicity, etc., contributes to the formation of the corona. Various interactions take place between the corona and the surrounding environment and the corona dynamically changes. These interactions include steric hindrance, protein binding capability, available surface area, binding interaction and characteristic protein attachment/detachment. Steric hindrance prevents binding of the corona to other particles. The available surface area, surface coverage and angle of curvature determine the adsorption profile of nanoparticles. Binding interaction releases surface-free energy, leading to surface reconstruction of the corona. Competitive binding interaction depends upon protein composition and body fluid composition. Characteristic protein attachment/detachment depends upon the material type and protein characteristic. All these interactions help to change the corona dynamically. The corona changes when particles translocate from one biological compartment to another. In the process of formation of the protein corona, when the protein interacts with nanoparticles, they undergo potential changes in their structure and function. Basically, protein conformational change takes place, leading",

            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

            "text": "As described in a previous section, NPs in contact with a biological medium, such as the blood, interact with the protein, leading to the formation of a bio-corona. One important family of such proteins are the complement proteins, and these proteins have been identified on the corona of several classes of NPs, such as iron oxide (Vu et al., 2019), silica (Park et al., 2020), lipid-polymer hybrid (Salvador-Morales et al., 2009), polymeric and, of particular relevance, PEGylated liposomes (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003;Szebeni et al., 2012). Complement proteins represent 5% of the blood proteins and the complement family is composed of more than 30 different proteins. Overall, these proteins \"complement\" antibodies in terms of promoting phagocytic clearance of foreign entities (pathogens). The binding of these proteins on the NPs may triggers the complement activation cascade by three different mechanisms (classical, alternative, lectin) (Figure 6), depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (size, morphology, surface patterns) and on the PEG composition and conformation (Ilinskaya et al., 2019;Hamad et al., 2010;Pannuzzo et al., 2020). The classical and lectin pathway is initiated by the recognition of patterns on the NP surface by soluble mediators in the blood, such as antibodies, IgG or IgM, and sugars (mainly N-acetyl glucosamine and mannose), respectively. On the other hand, when the spontaneous hydrolysis of the thioester bond in the protein C3 takes place, the alternative pathway is initiated. These mechanisms have been well described by Moghimi et al. (Moghimi and Simberg, 2017;Simberg and Moghimi, 2020). The complex proteolytic cascade generates the release of complement proteins such as iC3b, which enhance macrophage recognition, and the anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a and C5a (Moghimi and Szebeni, 2003). CARPA is triggered Later, a larger fragment, C3b, is covalently attached to the surface.",

            "text": "Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to improve the properties of targeted nanoparticles in vivo. 24 Various studies have investigated the effect of corona formation on nanoparticle targeting. 25 It was found that nanoparticles can recruit specific proteins from plasma, which eventually promote interactions with targeted cells. 26 Adsorption of apolipoproteins to polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles was shown to enhance the transport of nanoparticles across the blood brain barrier. 27 dditionally, Caracciolo et al. saw that the adsorption of vitronectin can enhance cellular interactions with cancer cells. 28 urther, we already showed that due to a pre-formed protein corona nanoparticle aggregation in blood plasma is prevented. 29 ext to this, other studies demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was strongly reduced if nanoparticles were precoated with cell culture medium containing FBS. 30,31 This highlights the great potential to exploit corona formation. \n\nTo take this one-step forward, we aimed to create a preformed protein corona, which enables controlled cellular inter-actions. Here, it was intended to engineer nanoparticles with stealth properties mediated only through corona proteins. Immunoglobulins (IgG) are one major class of proteins ('opsonins'), which are known to enhance cellular uptake by macrophages via interactions with the Fc receptor. 32 Therefore, we removed IgG from human plasma via affinity chromatography. This protein fraction ('IgG depleted plasma') was chosen as a protein coating in order to create a pre-formed protein corona,  which should prevent interactions with macrophages. To explore the stealth properties of the pre-formed protein, we analyzed the cellular interactions of uncoated and pre-coated nanoparticles with a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). Next, the major aspect of our work focused on the question, whether the pre-adsorbed corona proteins are exchanged or covered by other proteins over time, when pre-coated nanoparticles are reexposed to human plasma. This question needs to be addressed in order to reveal if nanoparticle pre-coating is an effective strategy to enable controlled cellular interactions in vivo.",

However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

            "text": "The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.Furthermore, the PEG content significantly affects targeting of extrahepatic tissues.For instance, Zhang et al. [69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

            "text": "One key biological interaction is protein fouling, or protein corona formation, where proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface upon exposure to serum. This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

It is important to note that formation of non-polar lipid structures, such as LNPs/Liposomes, depends not only on the hydrophobic interaction of non-polar lipids but also on the van der Waals forces of interaction among lipid tails of constituent lipids [53]. Lipids with shorter carbon chains therefore have a lower binding force with the lipid assembly and have more chances of breaking out of the lipid arrangement [54]. An additional trigger for this lipid release from the nanoparticle system could be the large PEG overhang on shorter carbon chain lipids on the nanoparticle surface which is highly water soluble. Another factor that can be used for PEG shedding is branching or unsaturation in the carbon chains, which limit lipid packing and reduce the melting point and subsequently the stability/lipid desorption in vivo [55]. Whatever the PEG shedding method, once the PEG layer is removed, the exposed LNP surface can freely interact with the target membranes.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "The conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles have been modified to improve the efficiency of drug delivery. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins, leading to the formation of protein layers on the nanoparticle surface, called protein corona. Experiments have shown that protein corona modulates nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties and, thus, influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, which can increases or decreases the delivery efficiency. To complement these experimental findings and understand atomic-level phenomena that cannot be captured by experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed for the past decade. Here, we aim to review the critical role of MD simulations to understand (1) the conformation, binding site, and strength of plasma proteins that are adsorbed onto nanoparticle surfaces, (2) the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on nanoparticle surfaces, and (3) the interactions between protein-coated nanoparticles and cell membranes. MD simulations have successfully predicted the competitive binding and conformation of protein corona and its effect on the nanoparticle\u2013nanoparticle and nanoparticle\u2013membrane interactions. In particular, simulations have uncovered the mechanism regarding the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins, which helps to explain the Vroman effect. Overall, these findings indicate that simulations can now provide predications in excellent agreement with experimental observations as well as atomic-scale insights into protein corona formation and interactions.",

The adsorption of proteins to nanoparticle surface establish a protein corona has been given particular attention in the recent years, particularly within the context of nanomedicine targeting. Since many proteins are amphipathic, they have the potential to interact with almost any nanoparticle surface in their vicinity. Consequently, the interfacial interactions of nanoparticles with proteins are inevitable in such environments. In concordance, as expressed thermodynamically by D ads G < 0 (where D ads G symbolises the Gibbs free energy of adsorption), this mechanism of lowering the excess surface energy of nanoparticles is spontaneous. 40 The surface adsorption of serum proteins by particles (opsonisation) was \ue103rst postulated by Wright and Douglas in 1903. 41 Later in 1962, whilst assessing the surface adsorption of \ue103brinogen in blood plasma, Vroman noticed that the maximum surface concentration of \ue103brinogen was attained at an intermediate time point, suggestive of its substitution by other proteins with time. 42 Described by the Vroman effect, corona formation is a dynamic and competitive process. The initial stages of adsorption are dominated by small (high mobility), abundant proteins. However, with time, some of these proteins are substituted by those which are larger (low mobility), less abundant and have greater affinity for the surface. 43 An equilibrium is gradually attained, a\ue09der which each protein has equal rates of association and dissociation, and further exchange causes no change in the corona's composition. 44 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the protein corona branches into a 'hard corona' and 'so\ue09d corona'; these denote a \ue103rmly bound, equilibrium state layer (wherein proteins exhibit high affinity for the nanoparticle surface), and a loosely bound layer (comprised of low-affinity proteins in rapid exchange with those in the medium), respectively. 45,46 An intrinsic in\ue104uencer of protein corona composition is nanoparticle size. For both citrate-stabilised and PVP-stabilised silver nanoparticles, proteomic analysis of the acquired corona revealed that 110 nm nanoparticles",

            "text": "The opsonization is part of the innate immune system, enhancing the activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) to clear pathogens from the body. This welldocumented phenomenon, observed with all nano-objects, is a rapid process, leading to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of nanovectors, with a dynamic remodeling over time in blood [78][79][80][81]. Proteomics analyses performed on various NPs incubated with serum demonstrated that numerous plasma proteins (>100 different proteins and peptides) bind onto nano-vectors, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation factors, and many others [78][79][80][81]93]. Authors have brought evidence that the protein corona formation and dynamics might depend on the physicochemical features of the nanovectors, including rigidity, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic surface, as well as charged or neutral zeta potential [93]. Proteins interact with NPs by different mechanisms, mainly electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding [93]. Lipoproteins, especially apolipoproteins E and A-I, are particularly enriched in NP's protein corona, most likely through direct interaction with lipids, in case of liposomes and lipid NPs [94,95], as well as the hydrophobic core of polymeric NPs [78][79][80][81]. Interestingly, reports have recently shown that proteins within the corona, including the ApoE, induce structural rearrangements that may impact their cell internalization and overall biodistribution in vivo [93]. \n\nIn order to reduce opsonization and scavenging by MPS, NPs have been optimized through the modulation of their size, shape [2], surface charge [96], and chemical structure [97][98][99], including the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block.",

            "text": "[3] Nanoparticles (NPs) are prone to interact with proteins like fibrinogen (FIB), a major class of plasma protein that is essential for blood coagulation, when applied in physiological fluids (e.g., bloodstream or plasma), leading to the immediate formation of a protein layer on the particle surfaces (i.e., protein corona). [4,5] It is believed that the conformation and adsorption kinetics of protein corona are predominantly dependent on the surface properties of NPs (i.e., the surface charge, wettability, targeting groups, etc.). [6,7] The protein corona formation alters the biological identity of NPs, helping them to escape from the immune system and subsequently prolong their circulating lifetime in vivo. [8,9] owever, the protein adsorption would also gravely change the physicochemical properties of bioengineered NPs and remarkably reduce the targeting efficiency. [10] Worse still, the coronated NPs would form clusters or aggregates via non-specific protein-protein attractions, thus impairing the therapeutic efficacy. 13][14] It has been revealed that the NP-protein interaction may not obey the equilibrium adsorption mechanism, prompting us to reconsider the microscopic origins of the time evolution (or aging phenomena) for NP-protein interaction and protein-induced NPs aggregation. [15,16] [23] Nevertheless, limited studies have revealed how the two-timescale behavior is regulated by the distinct types of interactions. Besides, the number of surface-bound proteins may not monotonically increase with time. It has been reported that the soft corona can be completely removed from the surface of polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) in the presence of abundant plasma proteins. [16] Hence, the protein-to-NP ratio determines the composition of reversible and irreversible binding layers. On the other hand, NP-protein aggregation is inversely dependent on the protein-to-NP ratio, that fewer proteins result in larger aggregates. [24,25] Such aggregates with varied sizes and protein-corona constitutes shall exhibit rich structural relaxation dynamics and aging behaviors at multiple lengths and time scales.",

C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

            "text": "In the last decades, nanosized carrier systems for pharmaceutically active compounds have not only attracted the attention of researchers worldwide, but also emerged into clinical trials or even became approved drugs. [1][2][3] Many attempts have been made to modify the biodistribution toward higher target site accumulation, which requires engineering nanoparticle properties, e.g., size and surface. [4] In this context, the potential formation of a protein corona around nanoparticles is of primary interest, since this process changes the nanoparticle surface properties and thus co-determines the biological profile in the body. [5][6][7] Protein corona formation of various nanoparticles and its impact on pharmacokinetics has been carefully studied. [8][9][10] The tested nanoparticles were mainly inorganic or organic colloidal nanoparticles, [11][12][13][14] for which a pronounced corona formation was observed upon contact with plasma proteins. This protein corona modifies the interaction The current understanding of nanoparticle-protein interactions indicates that they rapidly adsorb proteins upon introduction into a living organism. The formed protein corona determines thereafter identity and fate of nanoparticles in the body. The present study evaluates the protein affinity of three core-crosslinked polymeric nanoparticles with long circulation times, differing in the hydrophilic polymer material forming the particle surface, namely poly(N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide) (pHPMA), polysarcosine (pSar), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). This includes the nanotherapeutic CPC634, which is currently in clinical phase II evaluation. To investigate possible protein corona formation, the nanoparticles are incubated in human blood plasma and separated by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4).

            "text": "Protein corona refers to the bound or adsorbed proteins around nanoparticles while they are exposed to various physiological fluids in the systemic circulation. Some of the most abundant proteins include transferrin, fibrinogen, albumin, complement C3, haptoglobin, \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, and immunoglobulins A, M, and G [158]. This exposure is inevitably responsible for altering their overall pharmacological and toxicological profile and ultimately triggers an unpredictable therapeutic function. Some of the physicochemical factors responsible for coronal protein adsorption include nanoparticle material hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, surface charge, size, and shape [158][159][160][161][162]. Studies have shown that a decrease in nanoparticle size decreases the surface interaction impacting the protein conformation, and similarly, a spherical shape of nanoparticles offers increased mass/surface ratio that overall reduces interaction with the proteins in the environment [163][164][165]. Additionally, the nature of the nanoparticle also plays a crucial role in the formation of the protein corona such that hydrophilic nanoparticles attract charged proteins via electrostatic forces, while hydrophobic nanoparticles bind to hydrophobic proteins through van der Waal's or \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions [162,166]. Lastly, the surface charge promotes protein corona formation in instances where the nanoparticles are highly charged as compared to slightly negatively charged nanoparticles, which offer the least protein interactions and therefore avoid the corona formation [167,168]. \n\nOver the past few years, there has been progressive understanding regarding the effect of protein coronas on nanoparticles. Taking a glance at its formation, initially, when the nanoparticles encounter biological fluids, a \"soft\" corona is formed that represents a loosely bound and rapidly exchanging layer of the highly abundant proteins adsorbed during circulation. Following this, it is further coated with other proteins of high affinity as per the Vroman effect and is now termed as \"hard\" corona [169][170][171]. This leads to a decrease in enthalpy and displacement of the hydration layer surrounding the nanoparticles, subsequently enhancing entropy.",

As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al. 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al. 2013). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al. 2007a). In some cases, the protein corona may not fully saturate the surface area of nanoparticle and Fig. 3 Depending on the bio-corona composition, the same nanoparticle can develop immune patterns that sustain pro-or anti-tumoral activities instead bind at discreet sites, leaving much of NP surface unobstructed, which could also affect its toxicity (Rybak-Smith and Sim 2011). Bio-corona may extend the half-life of the NPs in systemic circulation by preventing the nonspecific uptake by cells of RES. Noteworthy, over seventy different serum proteins may heterogeneously be adsorbed to the surface of NPs. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of NP uptake by a macrophage cell (Walkey et al. 2012).",

            "text": "TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane.

            "text": "The spontaneous self-assembly of biomolecules around the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) once exposed to plasma and other biofluids, has been termed the 'biomolecule corona'. While the protein composition of the biomolecule corona has been widely characterised, the interaction of NPs with the plasma lipidome has not been fully investigated. Here, we use targeted and untargeted lipidomics to analyse a wide spectrum of bioactive lipids adsorbed onto the surface of liposome NPs post-incubation with human plasma. Our data indicate that the biomolecule corona contains a diverse mixture of simple and complex lipid species, including sphingolipids such as ceramides and sphingomyelins, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, cholesteryl esters, as well as oxylipin and N-acyl ethanolamine derivatives of fatty acids. Although the corona lipidomic profiles reflected the overall composition of the plasma lipidome, monohydroxy- and oxo-fatty acid oxylipins, mono-, di- and tri- acylglycerols, sphingomyelins and ceramides showed a preferential binding for liposome NP surface. Interestingly, the biomolecule corona lipid profiles appeared to mirror those of the lipoprotein lipid cargo, suggesting that lipid species may be carried within the lipoprotein complexes attached to the corona. Proteomic analysis of corona-associated proteins showed the presence of several apolipoproteins (A-I, A-II, A-IV, B, C-I, C-III, C-IV, C2-C4, D, E, L, M and lipoprotein Lp(A)), supporting this notion. Our findings reveal the wide lipid diversity of the biomolecule corona and indicate a potential lipoprotein-mediated adsorption mechanism of lipids onto liposome NPs, highlighting the importance of bridging proteomics with lipidomics to fully comprehend the interactions at the bio-nano interface.",

The hard corona is the initial tightly bound layer of proteins, whereas the soft corona refers to the outer layer of proteins (not directly bound to the NPs). 165 The presence of protein coronas may trigger immune responses, leading to the rapid degradation of the macrophage phagocytic system and nonspecific cellular uptake, further affecting drug efficacy and targeting. 166,167 on-ionic surfactants can reduce the nonspecific adsorption of proteins onto nanoparticles, thereby decreasing the formation of protein coronas, which may be owing to the formation of hydrophilic shells on the surface of the nanoparticles, resulting in reduced protein-binding affinity. Additionally, when surfactants strongly bind with nanoparticles, it is difficult for proteins to displace them. 168 PEGylation is the conventional method used to reduce protein adsorption. PEGylated drugs and nanocarriers exhibit extended half-lives in the blood and reduced nonspecific cellular uptake compared with unmodified drugs. 169,170 However, PEG, which is a nonbiodegradable polyether, may accumulate in the body upon prolonged use of drug-PEG conjugates, leading to potential adverse effects. 171,172 Therefore, finding alternatives to PEG is crucial, and non-ionic surfactants have gained attention owing to their non-toxicity and biocompatibility. Mueller et al employed the non-ionic surfactant polyphosphoester (PPE) to coat nanoparticles, offering a simplified approach for modulating protein coronas and their biological effects. After incubation with plasma, protein adsorption on the nanoparticles coated with PPE decreased, and the uptake by the macrophages was reduced. 168 n addition, non-ionic surfactants may influence the composition and structure of the protein corona, thereby altering the interactions of nanoparticles with cells or other biomolecules (Figure 4).",

            "text": "Proteins constitute the majority of bonded biomolecules on the outer layer of nanoparticles in a serum-containing medium, but recently, traces of lipids have also been discovered [84]. Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between Blood flow is another important physical element that must be considered. Blood moves at a constant rate, ranging from 0.085 cm.s \u22121 in capillaries to 10 cm.s \u22121 in arteries, and a maximum of 60 cm.s \u22121 inside the aorta. Protein binding generally strengthens with increasing blood flow. However, the exact underlying cause is unknown, and it is speculated that the enhanced protein-blood interactions result from increased interactions between biological molecules and the nanostructures. Additionally, rapid flow rates induce shear stress on the outer layer of nanostructures, preventing the easy deposition of proteins and making it easier for them to connect with others that possess stronger affinity. For example, this might lead to the enrichment of proteins on the nanoparticles, such as plasminogen and other proteins. Similarly, blood flow could alter the conformational shape of unbound proteins, such as plasminogen or the von Willebrand factor (a protein that alleviates the dormant factor VIII blood-clotting protein). \n\nDiverse conformations can lead to variable interactions with nanosystems, and consequently, different protein corona compositions [82]. Furthermore, illnesses can alter the protein corona of a nanosystem. Researchers have investigated the effect of protein shortages on the remodeling of the protein corona on PS nanoparticles due to common illnesses and medical situations [83].",

One is a \"hard\" corona, which is irreversible, and the other one is a \"soft\" corona, which is reversible. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, transferrin-binding kinetics were found to contain two distinct steps. First, the hard corona forms, which is irreversibly bound to the particles. This is followed by the formation of a soft corona, which binds reversibly to the hard corona, forming a second layer. The time scale of protein adsorption and desorption for the soft corona was a number of minutes, whereas desorption of the hard corona took longer than the several hours in which the authors performed their analysis. This clearly delineates the corona formation phenomenon as two distinct steps. For soft corona formation, the kinetics of third-level, fourth-level, and higher-level corona formation appear to be in the same general time scale as second-level corona formation. 84 Irreversible binding was found to act as a \"memory function\" in the nanoparticle. The specific proteins that form the primary coronal layer depend heavily on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle, and the binding of subsequent layers is dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the first layer, which forms binding pockets with affinities for particular biological interactions. 84 Therefore, it is possible that these in vitro and in silico protein adsorption studies could be used to predict the behavior of the nanomaterial once it becomes a biomaterial complex. This irreversible binding, and the kinetics associated with it, implies a conformational change in proteins exposed to the nanoparticles, which the authors describe as a \"fingerprint\" or \"memory function\". This presents a unique and interesting perspective regarding these particles, ie, the inner corona effectively has a memory storage function on a biochemical level, which indicates",

Biological media, such as blood plasma, are incredibly complex and contain over 3,700 identified proteins, leading to a highly competitive environment for the formation of the corona. This phenomenon, known as the Vroman effect, highlights the dynamic nature of protein adsorption, where proteins with higher mobility and lower affinity initially occupy the NP surface, only to be replaced by proteins with higher affinity over time. \n\nIn addition to proteins, several other molecules in whole blood can contribute to the formation of the NP corona [36], including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, metabolites, complement factors, and antibodies [62]. For example, lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, glycans-which are carbohydrate molecules that play a role in cell recognition and signaling-or small metabolites like glucose, hormones, and vitamins can adsorb onto NPs, altering their surface properties and influencing their interactions with cells [61]. \n\nOn the other hand, circulating DNA is present in the blood of all individuals [67], and its concentration increases in cancer patients [28]. Furthermore, depending on the state of different diseases, blood plasma also contains a variety of RNA types, including mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and fragments of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and miRNAs [54,58], suggesting that the NP-corona composition also depends on the health condition of the host. Moreover, complement factors that are part of the immune system and immunoglobulins or antibodies, which are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells, can mark the NP for clearance by immune cells [61]. Therefore, it will be critical in the future to understand how all these components collectively form the biomolecular hard and soft corona, which significantly impacts the biological identity and fate of NPs in the body [62].",

            "text": "On this basis, for several decades protein corona was considered responsible for the triggering of the immune system and the final clearance of the nanomaterial. Actually, for most cases, protein corona formation is the very first step in the process of nanoparticle elimination [28]. Generally, coronas formed from the unspecific protein adsorption act as labels promoting nanoparticle recognition as \"non-self\" and, as a consequence, nanoparticle elimination by the immune system [29,30]. As a consequence, for a long time research has been focused on the development of antifouling coatings aimed at the complete suppression of biomolecule binding to nanomaterials. Noteworthy, antifouling coatings were believed to be the only coatings providing nanomaterials with the ability to avoid the immune system clearance. This phenomenon has been named the \"stealth\" effect and bio-inert coatings have been defined as \"stealth materials.\" Among them, the gold standard is represented by polyethylene glycol (PEG). \n\nParadoxically, \"stealth\" materials present immunological drawbacks. For example, it is well-known that the prolonged use of PEGylated materials results in the production of anti-PEG IgM antibodies [31,32] in a phenomenon known as \"accelerated blood clearance\" (ABC) [33]. Thus, with time, PEGylated nanocarriers are recognized by IgMs and accumulated in the liver [34]. Moreover, these drug delivery stealth vectors, although providing advantageous features such as long-term circulation in the blood, are in turn detrimental for cell targeting, internalization, and accumulation [35]. Complete protein corona suppression, besides being an unreachable goal, was recently questioned by the demonstration that the \"stealth effect\" requires the binding of specific plasma proteins. Thus, a nanomaterial, in order to avoid the immune system reaction, does not need to be protein repellent but protein selective. Noteworthy, such a revolutionary principle was demonstrated by studying PEG-modified nanoparticles [36].",

Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

However, these strategies are still limited at conferring targeting specificity since an additional targeting ligand increases the propensity for protein corona formation to mask the targeting ability and inhibit the biological effects of nanoparticles [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . This can explain why many nanoparticles with active targeting systems have failed in clinical trials 25 . Therefore, to design nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents, there is a considerable need to regulate protein corona formation on nanoparticles [26][27][28] and to obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in regulating nanoparticle-biological interactions.

Once in contact with a biological environment, nanosized objects immediately interact with the surrounding biomolecules, which can adsorb on the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona. 7,8 Some of the biomolecules in this layer associate with the nanoparticle surface almost irreversibly, affecting de facto the subsequent behavior. For instance, it has been shown that the formation of the corona can affect nanomaterial stability and biodistribution, macrophage sequestration, immune system activation, cellular recognition, and nanomaterial final fate. 9\u221211 In some cases, the formation of a biomolecular corona can also affect the specificity of targeted drugs, by masking targeting ligands attached to the nanocarrier. 12,13 Polymers such as poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are usually grafted on the nanoparticle surface to partially reduce protein binding and subsequent macrophage sequestration. 14\u221216 However, recent work suggested that the so-called stealth effect is actually conferred by specific corona proteins adsorbed on PEGylated surfaces. 17 At the same time, researchers are also trying to exploit the biomolecular corona as a targeting strategy to direct nanoparticles toward specific cellular routes. 18\u221220 So far, corona formation and its composition have been widely investigated. 21\u221224 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed",

            "text": "In particular, the initial interactions between NMs and biological fluids are difficult to accurately model. 19 hen dispersed in aqueous solutions containing electrolytes, NMs first interact with the ions present in the media, forming a thick solvation sheath that gives their hydrodynamic appearance. Likewise, in biological media, they are quickly and spontaneously covered by biomolecules, forming what is called biomolecular corona. While this paradigm initially attracted attention from the nanotoxicity context, it is now widely studied in the field of nanomedicine and environmental science. 20 Additionally, initial corona studies mostly focused on identifying the protein component. 0][31] Additionally, affinitybased interactions of proteins towards the NM surface and protein-to-protein interactions are responsible for changes in the corona composition over time. 32 Accordingly, two stages define the formation mechanism of the biomolecular corona on a NP. Firstly, engineered NPs enter the biological medium and come into contact with biomolecules, which adsorb onto the NPs' surface within seconds, forming the initial corona. 33 econdly, competition between proteins takes place, evolving the corona composition over time, until a stationary or slowly-evolving state is reached. 33 The biomolecular corona is usually divided into hard and soft corona, depending on factors such as the binding strength and rate of exchange of biomolecules from the surface of the NP. The hard corona (HC) is typically made of proteins directly adsorbed onto the NP's surface, which therefore exhibit long/constant exchange time with the surrounding molecules in the medium. On the contrary, soft corona (SC) proteins are known to be loosely attached to the NP surface, or most likely attached to an already formed hard corona via weak protein-protein interactions. Between them, the intermediate (or displacement) corona (IC) has been recently described as the transition layer made of biomolecules with moderate binding affinities and exchange rate with the NP surface compared to the HC and SC. 34 Consequently, the proteins of the HC are arranged in the inner layer of the corona, whereas the SC proteins are distributed in the upper layer of the corona.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

Many studies were focused on their covalent functionalization with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), to overcome MWCNTs limitations due to their toxicity and their tendency to aggregate in biological fluids (Tan et al. 2020;Yumita et al. 2020;Solhjoo et al. 2021). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the coating of DAAO with PEG enhances the enzyme stability, favoring the production of hydrogen peroxide over time (Rosini and Pollegioni 2020;Nakamura et al. 2021). \n\nAnother important aspect, to evaluate after administration of a nanocarrier into the human body bloodstream, is the interaction between the nanosystem and biological fluids components, essential to the formation of the 'protein corona' (PC), also called 'bio-corona', around nanoparticles. The formation of PC is a dynamic process, that involves many weak forces between physiological proteins and nanoparticles' surface (Fasoli 2021;Kopac 2021;Li et al. 2021). Protein corona composition and thickness are influenced by both nanoparticles features (such as dimension, morphology and surface properties) and environmental features (like biological fluid composition, pH and temperature). The bio-corona is able to affect nanoparticles properties, influencing their biodistribution and their targeting capacity (Nicoletti et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2021;Tengjisi et al. 2022). PC could be divided into two main layers: 'soft corona' (SC) and 'hard corona' (HC). Proteins belonging to HC directly bind nanoparticles surface with high affinity, generating a stable and nonexchangeable layer. HC is responsible of nanoparticle fate by controlling membrane adhesion, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution and interactions with surrounding cells.",

            "text": "Abstract Nanomaterials offer promising solutions as drug delivery systems and imaging agents in response to the demand for better therapeutics and diagnostics. However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

            "text": "Nanotechnology has experienced enormous growth in recent decades, bringing forward the surging use of engineered nanoparticles as advantageous novel materials in numerous fields such as biomedicine, cosmetics, pharmacology, food, or agriculture [1,2]. Its unrestrained used has resulted in the ubiquity of these nanomaterials in the environment [3] and biological systems [4], and thus nanoparticles may potentially be inhaled, ingested, or taken up through the skin into the body [5]. Then, when nanoparticles come in contact with biological fluids, they become covered by a complex layer of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars, forming a sort of \"bio-corona\" [6,7]. Within the biological corona complexes formed in biological systems, the predominant and most studied molecules are proteins, which on their own form the so-called nanoparticle protein corona complex (NPPC) [5,8]. The protein corona defines the biological identity of the nanoparticle, the NPPC being the entity that finally interacts with and is \"seen\" or recognized by the cell [6]. \n\nUpon introduction in a biological fluid, the process of protein adsorption is an almost instantaneous event given the higher binding energy of the nanoparticle surface compared to the surrounding biological environment (Gibbs free energy drives the complex stability) [9,10]. The formation of the corona, driven by non-covalent forces, is dynamic and changes over time because of continuous association and dissociation processes given the different affinity of the proteins. Initially, higher concentration proteins will interact with the nanoparticle, but will eventually be displaced by higher-affinity proteins until reaching an equilibrium, when protein exchanges would not affect the composition of the corona [6,9,11,12]. In fact, although the formation of the corona takes place over the period of an hour, occurring minor changes for around 12 h [13], plasma proteins have been found in the corona already within the first minute of exposure [14]. Interestingly, the composition of the corona at such early stages does not significantly change over time in protein identities, but in quantities [14].",

            "text": "Resulting from the rapid progress in nanotechnology of the past decades, nanomaterials have been developed with a broad array of applications. Colloidal nanomaterials such as nanoparticles (NPs) in particular hold a high potential for the field of precision medicine. 1 In biological media such as blood, NPs undergo highly complex interactions with the different biomolecules in their environment under the formation of a biomolecule corona. Particularly interactions with proteins have a striking impact on the properties and behavior of NPs in biological media. 2 Hence, the term 'protein corona'which describes the shell of adsorbed proteins around NPsis omnipresent in the research of nanomedicine. In order to achieve a controlled behavior of NPs in medicine, gaining control over NP-protein interactions (and therefore the protein corona) is obligatorily required. As a consequence, the physical mechanism of the interactions at the nano-bio interface is the focus of current research.\n\nUnderstanding NP-protein interactions is a challenging task to undertake, as most analytical methods deliver the final composition of the protein corona (or rather parts thereof), 3 but fail to elucidate the mechanism behind corona formation. Without answering the many questions around the specifics at the nano-bio interface, the future development of nanomedicines will primarily rely on presumptions. Not many techniques can compete with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in addressing this challenge. ITC yields quantified adsorption parameters from heat absorption or release resulting from intermolecular interactions. 4 Combining the thermodynamic information provided by ITC experiments with information from other methods gives deep insight into the mechanism of NP-protein interactions and the fate of protein-covered nanomaterials. 5 It is not the aim of this short review to reflect the addressed topics in their entirety, but to focus on the fundamental aspects of ITC, which can be important to the field of protein corona research. Furthermore, limitations of the method's state of the art and the use of auxiliary techniques for overcoming those limitations are addressed. For more detailed information, reviews that are more extensive are highlighted in the beginning of the respective chapter. reviews addressing and focusing on the protein adsorption onto nanoparticles, [6][",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

The nanoparticle complexed with SA more strongly interacted with the lipid membrane than the nanoparticle alone did, implying that protein adsorption could enhance the nanoparticle-membrane binding [93]. Our group simulated the adsorption of lipids onto gold nanoparticles coated with phenylalanine (Phe), showing the formation of a lipid corona on the surface of gold nanoparticle via electrostatic interactions between charged lipid headgroups and terminal groups of phenylalanine. At low lipid concentrations, unsaturated lipids could form a complete lipid corona around a single gold-Phe nanoparticle, as observed in the experimental observation of lipid corona formation, while saturated lipids only partially coated all gold-Phe nanoparticles, causing them to aggregate [94]. Bai et al. found that the surface charge of nanoparticles significantly influenced their interactions with zwitterionic and anionic lipids, affecting how the lipid bilayer wrapped around the nanoparticle. In addition, differences in lipid composition between the corona and the bulk lipid structure were driven by the nanoparticle's lipid affinity and the intrinsic properties of the lipids themselves [95]. Li et al. found that the preadsorption of SA onto nanoparticles weakened the interactions between nanoparticles and complemented protein C3b and the nanoparticle-membrane binding (Figure 12). This supported experimental observations that SA corona on the nanoparticle surface could inhibit further protein adsorption, thereby prolonging the circulating lifetime [96].",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

In the beginning seconds to minutes of this interaction, the more abundant blood proteins such as albumin will be dominant in the corona. 9 Over time, proteins with higher affinity (and lower concentration) will take over the space close to the NP's surface and proteins with lower affinity will be attached more loosely in the outer layers around the NP. 9 This kinetically driven evolution of the corona over time is commonly referred to as 'Vroman-effect'. 10 Common nomenclature for the more tightly bound proteins is the so called 'hard' protein corona, while loosely bound proteins are considered 'soft' corona proteins. 11 Properties of proteins and nanoparticles alike influence their intermolecular interactions with each other. NPs' properties of interest include size, 12 surface charge and functionalization, 11 stabilizing surfactants, 13 and hydrophilicity. 14 On the other hand, the proteins' properties of interest address their amphiphilic character, which leads to screening of hydrophobic parts of the protein from the surrounding water. 15 Similarly, smaller hydrophobic molecules can be transported by amphiphilic proteins such as lipids attached to apolipoproteins. 16 This amphiphilic nature in turn also leads to preferred interaction with other surfaces such as nanomaterials. The main forces governing the interfacial interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems are listed in Fig. 1 and in Table 1. 8 Remaining questions in the field include (but are not limited to) the possibility of protein-multilayers in the corona, 17,18 the exact mechanism of the Vroman effect with influence of kinetics on the protein corona, 10,19,20 and",

SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

            "text": "This competitive process of protein adsorbtion, which depends on protein concentration, affinity, and incubation time, is known as the Vroman effect [48]. Although there are certain proteins that are specific to certain nanoparticles and their composition in the protein corona depends on the characteristics of the nanoparticle, albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, and apolipoprotein are the proteins identified in almost all protein corona analyzes [49]. According to Carvedal and colleagues, this phenomenon is due to the high concentration of these proteins in the blood. \n\nThe composition of the protein corona at any time will depend on the concentration and kinetic properties of the plasma proteins, which is why it is important to know the dynamics of corona protein exchange, which will determine the role of the protein corona in the overall biological profile of nanoparticle [48]. Several trials of unexplained nanoparticles have shown that in biological media, solid corona proteins change very slowly, most of them over a period of several hours, while those of soft corona change very rapidly, within a few seconds. This time discrepancy points to the fact that the key factor in the biological behavior of nanoparticles lies in the interface of the solid and soft protein corona. A kinetic analysis of the protein corona of solid nanoparticles showed that the albumin was initially bound to the nanoparticles and then replaced by fibrinogen, after which fibrinogen was replaced by apolipoproteins. High plasma concentrations of apolipoproteinshave been shown to be able to replace fibrinogen within seconds [50]. Another study showed the kinetics of protein adsorbtion of lecithin-coated polystyrene nanoparticles.The results showed qualitative and quantitative changes in the protein corona. Namely, the corona content of C3, IgG and ApoE increased during the test period (360min), while the albumin content remained unchanged [51].",

            "text": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) represent perfectly suitable materials for a variety of biomedical and biotechnological applications. In many cases, MNP have to penetrate into different cell types of living tissue. This tissue and cellular uptake is strongly influenced by the particle size, as well as its surface chemistry and modification with functional groups or biomolecules. A detailed investigation and clarification of the interactions between surface chemistry of the particles and living tissue is a key to understand and control cellular uptake mechanisms [1].\n\nUpon application of nanoparticles into biological media (e.g., whole-blood or plasma), the formation of a protein \"corona\" around the particles takes place immediately. This corona is a completely closed protein monolayer of a few nanometers on the surface of the nanoparticles [2] and can be divided into a \"soft\" and a \"hard\" corona [3]. In the soft corona, a permanent exchange of macromolecules from the surrounding medium and the particle surface takes place and this leads to a fast and persistent variation of the structure of the soft corona. The hard corona consists of macromolecules rather fixed to the particle surface and shows a more or less temporal constant composition. The volatility of the proteins in the soft corona aggravates a detailed investigation of the influence of the unstable part of the corona and thus most work has been spent on the investigation of the hard corona [4]. It was found that the corona is much more complex than previously considered. The influence of different particle parameters on corona formation has been already investigated. Lundquist and coworkers [5] found that for a fixed type of material, the biologically active proteins in the corona are strongly determined by the size as well as the zeta potential of the particles. Furthermore, it is well-known that the adsorption of blood serum proteins to particles is time-dependent [6]. Proteins with the highest mobility are bound to the surface first and later they will be replaced by less motile proteins which show a higher affinity to the surface. This process can take several hours. Casals et al. [7] confirmed that a soft corona loosely attached to the particles surface changes to an irreversibly attached hard corona over time.

The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles.

            "text": "Another factor involved in the biological fate of nanosystems when administered to living systems is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) onto their surface. This corona corresponds to the shell of biomolecules (including proteins, enzymes, lipids, etc.) wrapping nanoparticles upon their entering within biological fluids [58]. As a result, a distinction should be made between the nanoparticle formulation designed by scientists and what is exactly recognized by cells in the bloodstream, i.e., the PC which will dictate the nanoparticle-cell interactions [59]. Depending on the binding strength between biomolecules and the system's surface, PC is generally described as a dynamic multi-layered structure ( Figure 5) [60]. Formation of a \"hard\" corona consisting of high-affinity proteins (i.e., apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and albumin) irreversibly bound with the particle surface is rapidly achieved within minutes upon incubation in a physiological fluid [61]. Weak protein-protein interactions occur between proteins from the hard corona and low-affinity proteins in the second layer, generally designed as the \"soft\" corona. Both layers are in a dynamic process involving continuous adsorption/desorption of proteins on and off the particle with varying kinetics depending on the contact frequency between the protein and nanoparticle as well as particle characteristics, such as surface area, shape, radius of curvature, etc. [62]. Depending on the type of nanomaterial, it has been demonstrated that the corona can have a size ranging between 3 and 15 nm [61]. Therefore, understanding the formation of PC around any nanomaterial is imperative to the applications of SPION as therapeutic or diagnostic nanomedicines as it may have advantages or disadvantages regarding their efficacy. It has been found that the entry route (i.e., inhalation, intravenous injection, oral administration) of nanosystems directly influences the composition of the PC and its evolution overtime in vivo [63,64]. In addition, it has been shown that loss of targeting properties, as well as a decrease of drug release (i.e., release of camptothecin from SPION or paclitaxel from",

            "text": "NPs are immediately covered with proteins generating the so-called protein corona [70]. The physicochemical properties of the NPs highly influence the composition of the protein corona formed on the NPs surface. Consequently, the corona is considered one of the significant players affecting the biological interactions of the NPs, including cytotoxicity, cell uptake, and transport. Additionally, the correlation between NPs properties and their cellular transport/uptake appears to be cell type-dependent, indicating that different kinds of mechanisms could take place [63,71,72]. \n\nThis process is reversible and in some cases, the proteins can be rearranged by forcing them into a specific orientation over the NP surface [72]. The preservation of ligand shell structure and composition is essential to conserve the selectivity and sensitivity, while nonspecific protein adsorption must be minimized. Some authors had shown that the surface charge of NPs influences their interactions with biological systems. Generally, neutral and negatively charged NPs show lower interaction with plasma proteins than positively charged ones that interact strongly with blood components, undergo nonspecific binding and cause cell lysis [63,70]. \n\nPEG linking is currently the most popular approach to rendering the NP surface inert toward nonspecific adsorption. Its properties as hydrophilicity, conformational flexibility, charge neutrality, and steric repulsion are responsible for its bio-invisible (stealth) nature [73]. As a proof-of-concept, Li et al., (2018) explored a photoinduced PEG deshielding nanocarrier TK-NPCe6&PTX to circumvent the challenge above. The TK-NPCe6&PTX encapsulating chlorin e6 (Ce6) and paclitaxel (PTX) were self-assembled from an innovative thioketal (TK) linkage-bridged diblock copolymer of PEG with poly (d,l-lactic acid) (PEG-TK-PLA). They demonstrated that the high PEGylation of TK-NPCe6&PTX in the blood helps the nanocarrier efficiently avoids rapid clearance and consequently prolongs its circulation time.",

            "text": "Understanding the interaction of particles with a biological system (i.e., biomolecules, organelles, cells, tissues) is a fundamental challenge in the particle safety research (Boraschi et al., 2020;Himly et al., 2020). The outcome of these interactions governs particle fate, including recognition, internalization, distribution within the cells, and activation of different signaling pathways.\n\nWhen the particle enters the biological microenvironment (i.e., blood, lung fluid or experimental cell culture media), its surface is covered by a layer of adsorbed proteins that form a socalled protein corona ( Figure 5). The protein corona alters the particle size, aggregation potential, and surface chemistry, giving the particle a biological identity that is different from its synthetic physicochemical identity (Ke et al., 2017). The corona further determines the biological responses by mediating the interaction of the particle with biomolecules (proteins, metabolites), membrane receptors, and physical barriers (lung epithelial cells, endothelial cells). The protein corona is a direct function of the particles' physicochemical properties, biological microenvironment, and the duration of exposure (Lundqvist et al., 2008). Each biological microenvironment has a distinct set of proteins that interact in a specific way with the particles' surface. Protein adsorption to particles does not always require direct contact with the particle surface and may instead occur via protein-protein interactions (Li and Lee, 2020). In addition, proteins can undergo conformational changes that together with nonspecific protein-protein interactions may be interpreted as a danger-associated signal (Corbo et al., 2016); initiating an immune response that may develop into a successful defensive response or an uncalibrated inflammatory reaction (Boraschi et al., 2020). Moreover, proteins adsorbed to a particle surface are in a constant state of flux, thereby causing changes in the composition of the protein corona because of continuous desorption/adsorption or by the so-called Vroman effect. The Vroman effect states that the adsorbed proteins can be replaced during time by proteins with higher affinity for the particle surface, even when present in smaller amount (Ang",

            "text": "In the field of nanoparticles and the subgroup of nanorobotics, their interaction with their environment in vivo is complex and ever shifting. As the MNRs travel throughout the bloodstream, proteins may be adsorbed to the surface of the micro/nanorobots. This accumulation of proteins onto the nanorobot is termed the protein corona phenomenon. The protein corona can affect nanoparticles' size, stability, shape, and surface properties, therefore also risking altering their functions. This can impact a nanorobots' ultimate fate within the body, its capacity to deliver therapies, and its toxicity levels (Zanganeh et al., 2016). The size and shape may also cause other issues in the body such as blockages, especially blood vessels. The protein corona is split into two distinct portions based on the nature of the bound proteins, both the hard and soft corona. The hard corona is formed by strongly adsorbed high-affinity proteins that bind readily to the nanoparticle in question, while the soft corona consists of low-affinity proteins that have weaker bonds with the nanoparticle. Soft corona is more dynamic compared to the hard corona, developing a shorter lifespan and readily changing (Kopac, 2021). The primary causes of protein corona formation are due to the non-covalent bonds between the protein sulfhydryl group and any metal atoms in the substrate of the nanorobot (Mao & Wan, 2023) as well as hydrophobic interactions which form the inner corona and the shielding of electrostatic adsorption which are responsible for the formation of the outer corona (Kopac, 2021). \n\nWhile it seems completely avoiding the formation of a protein corona is impossible, researchers are instead focused on controlling its formation and mitigating the undesirable effects of the protein corona. Instead, preadsorbing certain proteins and controlling the composition of the corona before injection in vivo has been shown to improve the circulation of nanorobots (Kopac, 2021). The precise effects of this corona can vary drastically depending on the adsorbed proteins that latch onto the nanoparticle, with effects ranging from disastrous to potentially beneficial.",

This is called the formation of the 'protein corona' [67]. Since 2007 the term 'corona' has been regularly used to denote the natural self-assembly of proteins onto the nanoparticle surface [53,144]. \n\nMost of the published works, which are carried out with plasma or serum and aim at therapeutic usage, focus on competition among proteins [81,145,146]. When the IONPs enter the physiological media, the proteins which attach to the nanoparticle surface determine the fate and biocompatibility of the IONPs. Those studies offer insight into the identification of the adsorbed proteins, and elucidate the factors controlling nanoparticle-protein interactions. The entire plasma proteome is composed of 3700 proteins, of which only 50 have been reported to bind to various nanoparticles [52]. The binding is described with reference to the Vroman effect with the concentration of each protein as the determining factor for the initial adsorption behavior [147]. Over time, proteins of lower abundance but with higher affinity and slower exchange rates replace the first-attached proteins [147,148]. However, the Vroman effect has been studied solely in mixtures of a few proteins, and these results likely do not correspond to the behavior in complex mixtures with other concentration profiles and broader biomolecular landscapes.",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona interaction with membrane and fusion pore formation followed by detachment from the membrane for sufficiently low ligand densities. Nanoparticles are considered rigid spheres and ligands are considered pH independent. The last condition guarantees that the number of bonds and receptors that is at the end of endocytosis is the same as the number that is at the beginning of exocytosis.

            "text": "Conclusively, the current state of knowledge demonstrates an urgent need for further detailed studies of protein adsorption to NPs on the molecular level. Most importantly, the temporal evolution from a weakly bound (soft) corona to a more persistent (hard) corona under physiological conditions needs a mechanistic explanation.\n\nFirst correlations between NP properties and their behavior towards proteins and cells were established, however, they now need a mechanistic explanation to gain predictive power. Current findings indicate the dependence of the protein corona composition in biological fluids on NP surface properties. However, some of the original surface properties may well be modified in the biological environment, which illustrates the importance of the persistence of NP surface functionalities under biological conditions. While large gaps still exist in the understanding of the fundamental physicochemical aspects of corona formation, even larger gaps exist in applying this knowledge to a realistic biological situation. The consequences of the protein corona (and its properties) on the biological behavior of NPs are still elusive and poorly understood.\n\nRecent years have seen substantial progress towards a better understanding of the interactions at the bio-nano interface, although many details remain to be explored. The importance of specific interactions between NPs and cell surface receptors has been shown, but the effects of physical and chemical properties of the NP surfaces deserve further attention. The key relevance of the protein corona in modulating cellular interactions has been recognized, but still very little is known about the dynamics of protein adsorption onto NPs in complex biological fluids, protein conformational changes associated with corona formation and the ensuing effects on cellular responses. Considering the wide variety of proteins, NPs and cell types much work remains to be done until a more complete picture can emerge.",

            "text": "In vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

Protein coronas are very easy to form, altering the biological capabilities of nanosystems, particularly tissue accumulation, cellular uptake, antibody clearance, payload excretion profile, and toxicity. Therefore, these properties of protein corona could be harnessed to develop personalized remedies for every individual with high precision and speed [40,41]. Some biopolymericbased nanoparticles might be useful for remediation treatment containing fatty acids, saccharides, or proteins.

Most current methods to study protein corona formation are ensemble-averaging and either require fluorescent labeling, washing steps, or are only applicable to specific types of particles. Here we introduce real-time all-optical nanoparticle analysis by scattering microscopy (RONAS) to track the formation of protein corona in full serum, at the single-particle level, without any labeling. RONAS uses optical scattering microscopy and enables real-time and in situ tracking of protein adsorption on metallic and dielectric nanoparticles with different geometries directly in blood serum. We analyzed the adsorbed protein mass, the affinity, and the kinetics of the protein adsorption at the single particle level. While there is a high degree of heterogeneity from particle to particle, the predominant factor in protein adsorption is surface chemistry rather than the underlying nanoparticle material or size. RONAS offers an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms related to protein coronas and, thus, enables the development of strategies to engineer efficient bionanomaterials.",

For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 .

For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 .

            "text": "In particular, the plasma proteins bind to the exogenous NPs, forming 'protein corona' on their surface, which immensely modulates biodistribution, therapeutic effects, and the toxicity of NPs [94][95][96]. When the protein corona contains opsonin as one of its constituents, the NPs undergo opsonin-triggered phagocytosis and accumulate in RES organs like the liver, spleen, and lungs, resulting in off-target distribution and rapid clearance from the circulation. Some vital factors determine the amount and diversity of the proteins present in the corona, such as the physicochemical properties of NPs, exposure time, and abundance of plasma proteins. It was found that NPs with hydrophobic and highly positive or negative surface charge demonstrated a higher tendency to form a protein corona than hydrophilic and neutral-charged particles [25,97]. NPs coated with PEG could protect the NPs from interacting with the plasma proteins through stealth effects which are highly dependent on PEG length and density [98,99]. As shown in Supplemental Table S1, unmodified SSNs showed affinity towards different kinds of proteins, leading to the distribution of the particles to RES organs and other vital organs. This might lower the amount of siRNA-nanocomplex in the circulation (i.e., shortening its half-life) owing to the rapid clearance, thus reducing the transportation of an adequate amount of siRNA into the target tumour site. The cationic domain of SSNs (Sr 2+ ) could interact electrostatically with negatively charged proteins available in the blood plasma, reducing their stability in blood. On the other hand, surface-functionalization of SSNs with PEG resulted in less entrapment of the proteins entrapment on their surface, as shown in Supplementary Table S2 and Figure 11A. The hydrophilic PEG layer on SSNs seemingly hindered the adsorption of different types of proteins on the particle surface due to the reduction of surface charge. Less interaction with opsonin proteins leads to higher stability in plasma, which might improve the accumulation in the target tumour cells.",

            "text": "While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

            "text": "The corona formation process depends on competition between proteins to be adsorbed onto the surface of nanoparticles. Miclaus et al. [42] suggested that the nanoparticle-protein interaction is dynamic, with exchanges between surface-bound and bulk proteins occurring on different time scales. Proteins with higher affinity for the surface exchange slowly, forming the hard corona, the innermost layer composed of tightly bound proteins (over longer periods of hours). Other proteins with low affinity are very quickly replaced, forming the soft corona, the outer layer composed of loosely bound proteins with lower affinity for the nanoparticle surface (over short time scales of seconds or minutes) (Fig. 4). \n\nTo better understand the interactions between nanoparticles and biological fluids, many studies have been performed in vitro and/or in vivo on tissues, on cells [42] and especially on proteins [44,45]. All current data indicate that it is the proteins contained in the corona and not the nanoparticles themselves that interact with the cells [46,47]. Therefore, the nanoparticle-corona complex is a new entity that represents \"what the cell sees\", with the corona being the interface between the nanoparticle and the cellular system [46]. Thus, under physiological conditions, the protein corona that forms on the surfaces of nanoparticles determines their biological identities [48][49][50][51][52][53][54]. It has been suggested that this protein corona is more significant in determining the biological response (i.e., immunogenicity) than the bare material properties of the particle itself [43]. \n\nThe parameters that affect corona composition include particle size [50], particle shape [55] and particle surface [56] properties as well as biological fluid properties and composition [47]. The formation of both soft and hard coronas is an equilibrium process in which the protein composition is directed by the initial concentration of each protein in the medium as well as its off rate (k back ) [42]. Corona formation and composition have important implications for both toxicity [43] and internalization [57].",

There are several thousand proteins in blood at up to a billion time differences in relative concentrations of protein corona. 1 The adsorption of proteins on nanpoparticles (NPs) can modify the diverse physicochemical properties of NPs such as size, surface charge, surface composition, and functionality, hence giving NPs a new biological identity. This NP-protein complex, not bare NP, determines various biological responses such as fibrillation, cellular uptake, circulation time, bioavailability, and even toxicity. The layers consisting of bound or adsorbed proteins around NPs are called as protein corona. High surface energy may enhance the binding of protein on to NP surface. Figure 1 shows the formation of protein corona and exchange of adsorbed proteins over time in biological conditions. Protein corona patterns mainly depend on the physicochemical properties of NPs (nanomaterial, size, charge, surface functional groups, shape) and exposing environments including immersed media components, temperature, pH, dynamic shear stress, and interaction (or exposing) time. Proteins with large quantities are first bound to NP surface, and then gradually replaced by",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

The BC changes nanoparticles' biological identity triggering activation of the immune system. As most plasma proteins are anionic at physiological pH, the biomolecular corona provides nanoparticles with a negative surface charge that generally reduces association and capture by immune cells. Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. Immunogenic epitope generation caused by protein denaturation activate cell receptors (e.g., the integrin receptor Mac-1) and stimulate signaling pathway leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "In summary, the presence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface reduces both membrane adsorption rate and duration. This is consistent with the idea that surface energy effects drive both corona formation and membrane interactions. 12,21,48 In the absence of a corona, the high surface energy of the bare nanoparticle surface makes the particle adhere strongly to the membrane. In the presence of a corona, on the other hand, the nanoparticle surface has already been passivated due to corona formation and subsequent particle-membrane interactions are weaker. Naturally, other interactions could modulate these effects, but they appear to be too weak to change the overall outcome. Aside from the large difference between the presence and absence of a corona, we also observed fewer long-lived adsorption events under full corona conditions compared to hard corona covered particles. Particle size, on the other hand, did not seem to affect the duration of binding, but it did alter the adsorption rate. We attribute this to either reduced dynamics at the surface and/or particle-membrane interactions. Under conditions mimicking the shear stress in blood capillaries due to flow, the number of events reduced substantially, but the average residence time increased. We interpret this as an inhibition of transient particle interactions under flow. Finally, a negatively charged HeLa cell membrane mimicking bilayer showed a decreased number of adsorption events compared to the neutral membrane. We attribute this to the presence of electrostatic interactions between the bilayer and molecules in the biomolecular corona once the particle complex is in the vicinity of the membrane (<1 nm). \n\nNon-specific lipid bilayer-particle interactions have been characterized as a first step towards understanding the more complex cellular membrane-particle interactions. The outcomes reported here are relevant for the interpretation of more biomimetic systems where both non-specific and specific interactions are present. 1][52][53] Our results indicate that, in terms of non-specific interactions, the total number of adsorption events increases with particle size. Thus, the observation of a cell uptake maximum would have to be interpreted with this in mind. However, it remains to be determined to what degree the non-specific interactions investigated here are relevant when cell receptors are present.",

Physicochemical properties of NPs including size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity affect the relative amounts, types, and conformations of proteins that adsorb onto the NP. \n\nNPs functionalized with disease-specific targeting ligands are positioned to revolutionize the treatment of debilitating diseases such as cancer by achieving targeted and selective cellular interactions. However, the biomolecular corona diminishes those cellular interactions by making the ligands inaccessible at their surfaces. Therefore, development of strategies to overcome the negative impact of the protein corona on NP targeting is necessary. Recently, attaching targeting ligands to longer PEG tethers in combination with backfilling of the remaining bare surface with short PEG chains has been shown to promote the formation of targeted interactions in vitro (Dai et al., 2014). It is seemingly obvious that characterization and biological evaluations NPs must be performed in the presence of physiologically relevant protein levels, which will ultimately result in the enhanced in vivo efficacy of targeted drug delivery platforms.",

            "text": "Accordingly, any attempt to engineer NPs for biomedical applications must take this inevitable modification into account. The processes occurring during formation of this interfacial layer are exceedingly complicated, however, and even fundamental issues are still under debate. \n\nThe physical nature of the protein corona is largely governed by the (surface) properties of the NPs and by the types and (relative) amounts of biomolecules (and their individual properties) present in the biofluid [13e16]. Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment [21]. The physicochemical properties of the NP surfaces greatly affect protein adsorption and thereby control the properties of the biomolecular corona, which mediates the interaction between nanomaterials and the biological environment. The physical nature of the corona depends on the detailed history of the biofluid exposure (e.g. in vitro vs. in vivo), the type of organism and even the health status of a patient. \n\nMany useful reviews have appeared in recent times addressing NPs for biomedical applications and the implications of protein corona formation for NP engineering [12,22e27]. Here we have not aimed at contributing yet another exhaustive review. We instead focus on three different areas that deem particularly important for further advancement of NPs for biomedical applications. After a brief sketch introducing important aspects of the protein corona, we first address fundamental physicochemical issues of protein corona formation, which have been explored in in-vitro studies, with a special focus on the underlying mechanistic details. Second, we present recent examples of how a molecular-scale understanding can be used to control the nature of the protein corona, enabling the engineering of NPs with advantageous properties for nanomedicine applications.",

            "text": "Furthermore, recent evidence has revealed that the nonspecific resistance to protein adsorption provided by antifouling materials does not necessarily afford the best therapeutic outcome. In one aspect, the adsorption of some types of proteins, especially those belonging to the dysopsonin family, could remodel the identity of nanomaterials to one invulnerable to immunosurveillance, thereby extending their blood circulation period 23,24 . In addition to this aspect, with regard to feasibility, completely resisting protein adsorption in vivo is difficult 23,25 . Overall, it is now increasingly agreed that controlling the protein corona (i.e., shifting the adsorption of dysopsonins versus opsonins) [26][27][28] , rather than trying to realize its total elimination, would allow the nanomedicine to function better. \n\nIn addition to experimental findings [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] , computational progress has also advanced our understanding of the protein corona, especially at the molecular level [38][39][40][41] . In one demonstration, a multi-scale approach was developed to assess the role played by glucose and cholesterol during fibrinogen protein adsorption 38 . Likewise, using dissipative particle dynamics simulation, our group 41 revealed that adsorbed human serum albumin (HSA) protein was implicated in the interaction of nanoparticles with membranes. These computational findings give us insights into the mechanism underlying the interaction of nanoparticles with proteins and, more importantly, show how the protein corona governs the identity of nanoparticles. \n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the combined efforts of experimental and computational investigations can unveil a robust yet simple means of controlling the protein corona. In brief, in vitro analyses and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the availability of hydroxyl groups can affect the interaction of nanomaterials (herein, graphene and gold) with three representative serum proteins (HSA, IgE, and ApoE).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

            "text": "Protein corona refers to the complex of proteins and other molecules that are involved in the interaction to nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids. Molecules are adsorbed on the NP surface on the basis of the chemical characteristics of the NP itself. Usually, a first layer of proteins abundant in the matrix interacts with the NP surface, forming the so called \"soft\" corona. Such a layer may then be substituted by the \"hard\" corona, made of less abundant protein, but with a higher affinity for the NP (see Figure 5) [42]. \n\nProtein corona can be formed both in vitro, incubating the nanoparticles (NPs) with biological samples, or directly in vivo. Hajipour et al. reported that various types of disease can specifically affect the composition profile of protein corona [43]. These findings have been exploited by different Biology 2020, 9, 202 8 of 25 research groups by using liposomes as NPs able to scavenge the blood pool and surface-capture low-molecular-weight and low-abundance plasma proteins that cannot be detected by conventional plasma proteomic analysis. During the last decade, protein corona research has gained popularity, with many attempts made to molecularly characterize corona profiles after the ex vivo incubation of NPs in biofluids (mainly plasma), and more recently, upon allowing their in vivo circulation in rodents [44][45][46][47]. Hadjidemetriou et al. analyzed and characterized the protein corona formed onto polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated doxorubicin-encapsulated liposomes (Caelyx), recovered from the blood of ovarian carcinoma patients [48]. Their study described the protein corona formed on the outer liposome surface and highlighted the potential of such a novel tool in accessing the blood circulation proteome. An interesting work was carried out by Palchetti and coworkers, who studied liposomes uptake and drug formulations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients [49].",

The corona composition depends on the time-dependent environmental conditions and determines the NP\u2019s fate within living organisms. Understanding how the corona evolves is fundamental in nanotoxicology as well as medical applications. However, the process of corona formation is challenging due to the large number of molecules involved and to the large span of relevant time scales ranging from 100 \u03bcs, hard to probe in experiments, to hours, out of reach of all-atoms simulations. Here we combine experiments, simulations, and theory to study (i) the corona kinetics (over 10\u20133\u2013103 s) and (ii) its final composition for silica NPs in a model plasma made of three blood proteins (human serum albumin, transferrin, and fibrinogen). When computer simulations are calibrated by experimental protein\u2013NP binding affinities measured in single-protein solutions, the theoretical model correctly reproduces competitive protein replacement as proven by independent experiments. When we change the order of administration of the three proteins, we observe a memory effect in the final corona composition that we can explain within our model. Our combined experimental and computational approach is a step toward the development of systematic prediction and control of protein\u2013NP corona composition based on a hierarchy of equilibrium protein binding constants.",

For this reason, many open-ended questions have long remained elusive including if the so\ue09d corona is different in composition from its hard counterpart, and whether proteins enriching the so\ue09d BC trigger nanoparticle-cellular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that only a minor fraction of proteins is unique to so\ue09d BC, while the largest fraction is also present in the hard BC, showing that the same proteins can interact strongly or weakly with nanoparticles or pre-adsorbed neighboring proteins. \n\n9][50] Among them, the protein source (e.g., human vs. mouse serum) is surely the factor contributing most to the enrichment of the biomolecular corona with immunogenic proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement proteins). For instance, Caracciolo et al. demonstrated that two different formulations of cationic liposomes were more enriched in immunogenic proteins following exposure to human plasma (HP) than they were a\ue09der exposure to mouse plasma (MP). 51",

            "text": "As previously commented, when NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona [76]. This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities [31]. Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers [77] showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa [78,79]. At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake), see Figure 5    As the PEG density increases, fewer proteins are adsorbed. The lower panel shows that at low PEG densities, macrophage uptake is efficient and serum-dependent. At high PEG densities, macrophage uptake is driven predominantly by a less efficient serum-independent mechanism. Reproduced from [77] with permission.",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

Firstly scientific developments now suggest that biological recognition of nanoscale surfaces entails levels of complexity and subtlety not previously recognised. For example, the identity of the protein corona may influence drug release profiles. 19 Blood circulation times may require the recognition of specific proteins or protein motifs on the particle surface. 20 onversely other proteins may lead to a lower probability of recognition and longer nanoparticle (NP) circulation times in vivo. 5 The complexity is well described in the work of Cai  et al., where the authors suggest that \"appropriate surface ligands with reduced protein binding and desired long blood circulation time could be predicted from acquired corona composition\". 21 29][30][31][32] In particular, questions about how interactions with environmental molecules are influenced by the ligand coverage (surface density) and conformation have been raised. \n\nThe original paradigm of nanoscale biomolecular recognition that was framed around the 'biomolecular corona' 24 may be briefly summarised as follows. Those environmentally derived biomolecules presented 'accessibly' 22,23 on the nanoparticle surface with residence times exceeding a critical 'processing time' are deemed to be involved in biological recognition and processing and termed 'hard corona', whereas those that exchange faster are termed 'soft corona' and while they affect physicochemical aspects of the material they are unlikely to contribute directly to recognition.",

            "text": "Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73). Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

            "text": "It is nowadays accepted that IONPs adsorb a plethora of ions and biological molecules (i.e., lipids, sugars, proteins) when they come into contact with biological fluids such as blood [94]. This biomolecular corona ultimately affects the interaction of non-functionalized IONPs with biological systems, a property known as \"biological identity\". The biomolecular corona must be taken into account when considering the intrinsic biological effects that IONPs can produce. Indeed, Escamilla-Rivera et al. found that PEG-coated IONPs absorb a wide variety of complement recognition proteins when incubated with human serum, leading to complement activation when injected in mice [95]. Similarly, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the addition of IONPs to the hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold enhances osteogenesis in vivo, most likely mediated by a dynamic formation of a protein corona enriched in complement-, wound healing-, and inflammatory-related factors [96]. These reports thus suggest that the protein corona can endow IONPs with immunomodulating features. However, the biomolecule corona largely depends on the surface coating of the metallic core of IONPs as demonstrated by Vogt et al. These authors found that silica-coated and dextran-coated IONPs adsorb a distinctive subset of serum proteins, which leads to a differential effect on primary human macrophages [97]. Furthermore, the inherent dynamic nature of the protein corona, more specifically the so-called soft corona that exhibits a high exchange rate, can affect the biological identity of IONPs. Ashby et al. reported that a highly hydrophobic surface coating promoted the deposition of human serum proteins having larger hydrophobic domains and a much faster exchange rate, and thus a more dynamic protein corona. A similar correlation was found between larger core diameters and protein corona dynamics [98]. Nanoparticle size also seems to correlate inversely with the protein corona, not only in terms of composition but also in protein amount, due to a curvature effect [99]. Nonetheless, Ashby et al. evidenced for the first time that a soft corona is much less influential in IONP endocytosis than a hard corona [98].",

            "text": "It can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona. The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

For those applications where nanoparticles (NPs) interact directly with living systems or biological \ue104uids, interactions of NPs with biomolecules must be considered as NPs readily adsorb a coating of biomolecules. [1][2][3][4][5] In biological \ue104uids such as blood, this coating is dominated by proteins and is o\ue09den referred to as the protein corona. 6,7 The protein corona confers a new biological identity on the NPs and mediates biological response to the NPs, including cell uptake, immune response, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity. 6-10 A complete understanding of protein corona populations and evolution in the body will expedite the transition of NPs into clinical settings. 4,[10][11][12] There are many factors that in\ue104uence the NP protein corona, including NP biophysical features, solution conditions, and the features of the biomolecules present in solution. In clinical settings, this complicates application of our understanding of protein coronas formed under laboratory conditions to coronas formed in living systems. 4,[10][11][12] For example, individuals with diseases or at different stages of life have altered blood chemistries, including varied metabolites and protein expressions. Wide variation of protein coronas across individuals, coined \"personalized protein coronas\", [11][12][13][14] has been con\ue103rmed by proteomic approaches. 12,15 Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level show that metabolites including glucose and cholesterol can mediate the pro\ue103les of \ue103brinogen adsorption at the NP surface. 13 Minor variations in the corona, or even in an individual protein at the surface of a particle, can alter recognition and cellular uptake of the NP. 8,9,15,16 Studies of the protein corona range from identi\ue103cation and quanti\ue103cation of the dozens to hundreds of proteins within the corona to evaluation of individual protein-NP interactions at the atomic or molecular level.

The limitations and inherent problems that inhibit the progression and utility of such NPs lies in the fact that several pivotal nanobio interactions are generally overlooked during the study. Thorough knowledge regarding the varying pattern of corona formation is very important as under ideal in vivo conditions the true identity, fate, and performance of the desired NPs depend on the adsorbed biomolecules. The toxicity, drug loading efficiency, sustainable release, biodistribution, and accumulation can be Review RSC Advances altered based on the protein-adsorptive behavior of the NPs. Critical aspects such as mapping the protein binding sites and evaluating the spatial organization have technically improved the understanding of the NPs-protein interaction. 93 The details of protein coronation at a molecular level still needs more work. Additionally, advanced analytical instruments such as superresolution \ue104uorescence microscopy and Forster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy that can analyze/visualize real-time protein coronation would potentially add interesting insights. Information about protein corona evolution based on the individual's physiological condition, age and lifestyle can be used as a potential disease monitoring tool. To practically employ such applications, all the parameters that determine protein coronation should be studied in a simulated biological system. Several groups have identi\ue103ed different physicochemical properties of corona proteins; however, sometimes results from different labs were contradicting in nature even when the investigating NPs were the same. 94,95 Hence, the interaction of the NPs with the proteins based on the circadian rhythm, body temperature, pH, and shear-stress from the \ue104uids in the presence of other major biomolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, immune cells, degrading enzymes, should be collectively analyzed. Apart from the immune cells, the presence of white blood cells (WBCs) and coagulation factors can also in\ue104uence the interaction of NPs with the proteins. Experimental setups thus can include the use of whole blood to understand the impact of such interfering factors. Also to better understand the scenario of corona formation it is necessary to take into consideration the hemodynamics of the blood in the vascular system.",

Besides, the insights provided in Section 2.3 are applicable here, given that passive targeting involves preventing protein corona formation.Despite this theoretical basis, the reality is that few studies have established a clear correlation between protein corona formation and biodistribution to the tumor.\n\n107][108][109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116] However, other materials like DMG-PEG 2k or PEG-polymers have gained popularity, especially in the context of siRNA delivery. [117,118]One of the primary factors driving the widespread adoption of DSPE-PEG is its hydrophobic segment, which plays a role in retarding detachment from various NPs, including LNPs. [21]This property contributes to the extended circulation time and enhanced accumulation of these NPs at tumor sites.In fact, in vivo studies intended to investigate the importance of PEG-lipids with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C14, C16, and C18) such as DMG-PEG, DPPE-PEG, and DSPE-PEG, concluded that the lipophilic segment of PEG-lipids not only governs their dissociation rate from siRNA polymer-lipid hybrid NP surface but also exerts tumor accumulation and silencing efficiency (Figure 4).Notably, surface modification with DSPE-PEG exhibited the most extended blood circulation time and the highest levels of tumor accumulation and gene silencing effectiveness. [119]Certainly, PEGylated LNPs, which are extensively used as carriers for RNA, have also been explored for the delivery of mAbs, [111][112][113][114][115][116] although this exploration has mainly centered around liposomes incorporating DSPE-PEG 2k .[116] Instead, a number of pharmacokinetics studies have shown the possibility to correlate the tumor accumulation of PEGylated nanostructures carrying different mAbs with a great antitumor outcome.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery and antitumor therapeutics [1][2][3][4][5]. Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

            "text": "Significant progress has been made towards understanding the protein corona formation around NPs, yet, the current state of knowledge clearly emphasizes the continuous need for further molecular-scale studies of protein adsorption to engineered NPs. \n\nThe effect of protein corona formation on colloidal stability has been investigated and remains a very relevant problem for any studies under physiological conditions. While we have discussed first mechanistic insights in this review, further work along these lines is needed in order to understand molecular mechanisms and to identify the NP-related parameters governing this behavior. Not only the efficiency of the corona formation but possible individual proteins contribution to interparticle-bridging and denaturation of proteins may be decisive factors in this respect. We have discussed recent advances showing that protein adsorption can indeed be validly described as an equilibrium process but we point out that this may strongly depend on the properties of the NP surface and also on the individual properties of different proteins. It remains a focus of current research in this context to identify the possible parameters, conditions and forces that may cause deviations from a pure equilibrium or lead to kinetic hindrance on specific NP surfaces. \n\nSize alone and, hence, surface curvature has been identified as one factor governing the composition of the protein corona under physiological conditions [8]. While the mechanistic aspects of this finding remain unclear on a molecular scale, the biological implications may be dramatic. As discussed here, recent findings show that the interaction between corona carrying NPs and the cellular plasma membrane plays a central role for cellular uptake [4]. Moreover, it has been suggested that smaller NPs need to exceed a critical threshold concentration on the plasma membrane before the internalization process is triggered [170]. Understanding the role of the physiological protein corona and its NP-size dependent composition will clearly be an important aspect of future work in this area. \n\nThe individual contribution of functional groups within proteins has received some attention and a central aspect along these lines will be our understanding of the relation between the affinity of individual groups to the NP surface and the affinity of the protein, which is additionally governed by avidity effects. This remains a formidable task, since so many factors, including protein unfolding, entropic effects and effects related to the competitiveness of protein adsorption add further complexity to this issue under physiological conditions.",

We review consequences of corona formation for colloidal stability and discuss the role of functional groups and NP surface functionalities in shaping NP\u2013protein interactions. We also elaborate the recent advances demonstrating the strong involvement of Coulomb-type interactions between NPs and charged patches on the protein surface. Moreover, we discuss novel aspects related to the complexity of the protein corona forming under physiological conditions in full serum. Specifically, we address the relation between particle size and corona composition and the latest findings that help to shed light on temporal evolution of the full serum corona for the first time.

            "text": "Since NPs are injected into the bloodstream, they are exposed to a large amount of biomolecules that form a corona around them [76] (Figure 5). Protein corona is mainly composed of proteins with different affinity interactions: immunoglobulin G, serum albumin, fibrinogen, clusterin, and apolipoproteins [77]. Therefore, NPs experiment changes in their physicochemical properties and their biological identity once the protein corona is formed. Therefore, in order to know the possible adverse effects of the physicochemical, kinetic, dynamic, and thermodynamic interactions of NPs, the characterization of these NP-protein interactions has become one of the main challenges of nanomedicine. When NPs are incubated in a biological medium, a competitive dynamic process (between soluble biomolecules and surface) take place to form the protein corona. This process is based on the affinity adsorption of proteins on NP surfaces and on protein-protein interactions. According to the Vroman effect [78], the first are bound to NP surface proteins with a high concentration and low affinity and then are gradually replaced by higher affinity proteins present in low concentrations. The protein corona is classified into hard and soft depending on the duration of protein exchanges. Hard corona is a bound layer of proteins with high affinity and long exchange time. Proteins of the hard corona form the closest layer to the NP surface, so they are susceptible to thermodynamically favorable conformational changes (irreversible) depending on the chemistry functionalization, the hydrophobicity or hydrophily, the nature of proximal biological fluid, and the temperature [79]. Soft corona is a low affinity layer of proteins with a fast exchange over time. A recent model [80] suggests that hard corona is bound in a hard way to the NP surface and the soft corona is not directly bound to the NP but with a certain (low) degree of biomolecule interactions. As a result, the protein concentration, particle size, type of nanomaterial, and the surface properties are factors determining the layers of biomolecules and the protein corona density [81].",

The hydrodynamic diameter of corona particles was found to increase by 50 nm compared to thebare nanoparticles (Figure 4f). \n\nThe hard corona of sulphonated polystyrene (PSOSO 3 H, 100 nm, 200 nm) and SiO 2 (50 nm) nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5a-c. For bare PSOSO 3 H particles of diameter 100 nm in PBS, the monomer was consistent with the TEM image (Figure 5A) but the particle monomer peak was absent in the plasma mixture and the plasma intrinsic peak grew rapidly. The large cluster formation associated with a larger amount of protein (NP-protein complex) was confirmed in 100 nm sulfonated polystyrene, as shown in the TEM images, compared to the carboxylated NPs, where only a thin protein layer and no monomer complexes were detected (Figure 5B) [19]. The exposed charge surface of NPs in the biological milieu is a prominent feature for the determination of PC and their type of formation. The composition of PC is affected by the presence of the surface charge of NPs and their interaction with biomolecules restrains the fate of protein adsorption kinetics. To elucidate the impact of the surface charge of NPs on corona formation, Lundqvist and coworkers used polystyrene NPs withpositive (+) amine and negative (\u2212) carboxyl terminals incubated separately in human plasma and estimated the influence of the surface charge as a significant outcome [34]. The proteins susceptible to positive NPs were apolipoprotein F, mannose binding proteins, complement C1r, and the proteins susceptible to negatively charged NPs were majority of the Ig-gamma and Ig-kappa proteins. \n\nIn spite of the protein adsorption over the surface of NPs, the zeta potential remained unaltered in the range of \u221210 to \u221220 mV, indicating autonomous control over the physicochemical properties.",

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

The study of nanoparticle-protein interactions is essential since this will help us understand the feasibility of their use in living organisms, opening the way to new possibilities in the biomedical field. \n\nNPs are instantly modified once they come into contact with the bloodstream due to interactions with blood components. This spontaneous coating of NPs by proteins has been termed \"protein corona\" (PC) and is a determining factor for the pharmacology and toxicology of NPs [15]. \n\nThe first proteins that form the PC bind to the NPs very quickly because of the affinity of their amino acids and side chains for the NPs. These proteins already anchored to the surface bind, but instead of binding to the surface of the NPs, this second layer of the PC is formed by protein-protein interactions. The binding of the protein to a nanoparticle forms the complex known as NP-PC, and the characteristics of both are modified in such a way that researchers have recently begun to treat them as new NPs [16]. \n\nDuring adsorption to NPs, proteins may undergo conformational modifications to rearrange their structure. Binding proteins to flat-surface NPs can lead to more abrupt structural changes in the proteins than if the NPs were curved surface. This process is thermodynamically favorable if the charged or hydrophobic sequences of the proteins coincide with the hydrophobic or charged surface portions of the NPs [17]. \n\nThe affinity competition between proteins to bind to the surface of NPs is responsible for the protein corona changing over time; this allows us to distinguish between \"hard corona\" and \"soft corona\". The \"hard corona\" is considered the first protein layer that binds tightly to the NPs and is maintained for a long residence time (several hours).",

            "text": "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems [33,34]. Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands [35]. Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo. For this purpose, samples containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG), nano-carriers covered with POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL), and formulations with no PEG or POL in the content (NL0 and NLC0) were prepared and incubated for 1 h in human plasma from healthy volunteers. The results from the protein adsorption studies are given in Table 2. From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins [21,36]. Similar to PEG, the hydrophilic blocks of POL on the hydrophobic surfaces of lipid nanoparticles are capable of forming a hydrophilic barrier for protein adsorption, resulting in reduced mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and thus achieving a prolonged blood circulation time [20,[37][38][39].\n\nOn the other hand, it was revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of the adsorbed plasma proteins onto the formulations covered with PEG (p = 0.1448; p < 0.05; t-test) and POL (",

            "text": "Synthetic nanoparticles and EVs in biological milieus are surrounded by layers of adsorbed biomolecules, collectively referred to as the biomolecular corona. [82] The corona dynamically changes as nanoparticles traverse between various extracellular and intracellular compartments in the body. [83] The components in the biomolecular corona impact the biological identity of EVs, including immunological recognition and clearance (Figure 5). In particular, opsonins in the blood circulation play pivotal roles in mediating nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle uptake by innate immune cells. [84] Opsonins include complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and coagulation factors. Such opsonins may also cause a cascade effect where one opsonin causes the binding of others. For example, immunoglobulins on the biomolecular corona of synthetic nanoparticles attract complement proteins. [85] Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that EVs released by metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit a substantial abundance of complement protein H (regulator of the alternative complement pathway). [86] Complement protein H on these EVs facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by suppressing the activation of other complement proteins, resulting in evasion of the complement system. Therefore, the addition of complement regulatory factors on the EV surface may offer a promising approach to mitigate the complement response and reduce immunological recognition and clearance, as shown for synthetic nanoparticles. [87] Furthermore, decreasing the cholesterol content of EV mimetics reduced the adsorption of complement on the surface, [88] indicating that cholesterol content may also impact the immune clearance of EVs. \n\nOther abundant components in the biomolecular corona of EVs are lipoproteins and/or their protein components (apolipoproteins). [83] Varying affinities for lipoproteins impact the interactions between EVs and cells, including immune cells. [89] Lipoproteins are considered a major contaminant of EVs due to overlapping physical characteristics, [90] and methods have been developed to reduce lipoprotein abundance following EV isolation.

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

            "text": "The PEGylation-associated dynamic retention of 250 nm particles in response to magnetic force may increase the passage of nanocomposites through the leaky vasculature into the tumor tissue and thereby increase local concentration of the delivered drug. 13,53 revious studies have demonstrated a significant difference between the \u03b6-potential of PEG(\u2212) and PEG(+) MNPs in aqueous solution, 38 distinct behaviors in circulation are not attributed to the \u03b6-potential of MNPs, probably owing to nearly immediate corona formation after nanoparticles in contact with plasma proteins. 32,54,55 The enhanced capture of smaller PEG(+) MNPs may be attributed to the PEGplasma protein interaction and then agglomerate formation, resulting in an increased hydrodynamic diameter of MNPs. It has been recently demonstrated that plasma protein adsorption of PEG(+) MNPs, but not bare MNPs, triggers complement activation, 56 which may consequently alter protein corona composition, physical characteristics and particle behaviors in circulation. For larger MNPs, PEGylation may reduce particle-particle interaction induced by magnetic moment generation in magnetic field, and thus enhance MNP escape, allowing dynamic retention of MNPs in vivo. The results herein suggest that PEG(+) MNPs circulation can be magnetically captured. Moreover, the weakening vascular wall-nanoparticle interaction by PEGylation may facilitate blood residence, 27,32 favoring the therapeutic outcome with the target in the circulating blood. Nevertheless, the characteristics of PEGylated nanoparticles may also depend on the composition of the PEG moiety. 45 The molecular weight, 57,58 density 59 and conformation 39,60,61 of PEG may affect nanoparticle-cell interaction, 32,39 the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles, 32,59 and thus their behaviors in circulation.

            "text": "Noteworthy, such a revolutionary principle was demonstrated by studying PEG-modified nanoparticles [36]. Indeed, the concept of controlling the phenomenon of protein corona formation by designing novel and specific nanoparticle surfaces is progressively replacing the illusion of zeroing macromolecular adsorption [37]. Thus, elucidating the molecular interactions at the nano-bio interface will be crucial for predicting protein corona formation and composition of designed nano-vectors characterized by high biocompatibility and specific targeting functions [38,39]. \n\nAn ideal protein corona should act as camouflage, promoting nanoparticle recognition as \"self\" by the organism and, at the same time, acting as a chaperone, promoting the crossing of biological barriers (Figure 1). In this view, the merging of research from different fields of science is becoming increasingly urgent in order to bridge in vitro technologies with in vivo biomedicine. Moreover, synthetic biology will benefit from the comprehension of interactions occurring between biomolecules (biotic) and materials (abiotic) at the molecular level [40]. In this context, the concept of \"epitope map,\" proposed by Dawson and colleagues about twenty years ago [41], aimed at mapping the actual surface of the protein corona, ideally encompassing both protein composition and conformation. The epitope map is seen as the \"biological fingerprint\" of the particle-protein complex and defines its biological activity. Thus, the outer layer of the biomolecular envelop controls the interaction of the nanoparticles with cells and the nanoparticles trafficking to different cell compartments. Hence, this biological \"mask\" determines the fate of synthetic nanoparticles in biological systems. In the schematic representation, upon exposure to a biological milieu, most of the nanoparticles reported in the literature (yellow) are subjected to the unspecific binding of proteins (red). On the contrary, nanoparticles displaying binding selectivity (grey) lead to the formation of a shell composed of specific proteins (blue) promoting cell internalization. This biological envelope makes the difference between nanoparticles being internalized or being cleared by the immune system. Arrows represent the Vroman effect.",

            "text": "PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114]. mRNA-LNP formulations were developed using two short PEG-lipids (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) which quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum. On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.",

[21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

            "text": "The database access on PubMed makes it easy to judge a relevant scientific theme of important concern. As exemplified in Figure 1, a timeline search on PubMed with the title, \"nanoparticle and corona\" disclosed > 2000 publications from the years 2000 to 2020, and this number has increased eight-fold in the last decade. The surface coating of the NPs with PC in a living organism is indeed a prominent unresolved topic of discussionfrom a scientific and economic point of view. For decades there has been a steadily growing interest in the analysis of nanomaterials in biological fluid to trace the true molecular structure as expected during the preparation. This is valuable for nanotechnology and for biomedical and theranostic application. There is a wide gap between the drug discovery process and the biological identity of nanomaterials in the biological milieu. It has been identified that the surface of NPs alters due to the adsorption of protein, lipids, and biomolecules post-incubation in biological fluid. The protein-masked nanomaterials behave as new biological entities inferred as protein corona [1,2]. The formation of corona is a dynamic phenomenon governed by a lowering of the surface free energy in which various biological substrates compete for the same binding site onto the nanocarrier surface [3]. The protein adsorption on the surface of nanomaterials is considerably affected by their type, geometry, and conformation in biological fluid [4]. A lack of understanding associated with the in vivo performance of nanocarriers related to their physico-chemical characteristics, nanobiointeractions, blood circulation time, and corona formation could be rational explanations for the minimal translation of nanomedicines into clinical practice. The binding of proteins to the nano-surface is a complex, unpredictable process, affecting the fate of NPs related to biological and toxicological responses [5,6]. Numerous attempts have been made in the past to chemically modify the nanosurface to combat protein adsorption on to them. For instance, the functionalization of the NPs' surface with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain through PEGylation was designed to make it biocompatible and to allow a specific interaction with the cells and tissues of the biological compartment.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been increasingly used in cosmetics, food and biomedical applications, e.g. drug delivery and medical imaging. The rapid expansion of nanoparticle applications is due to their large surface area to volume ratio and electronic and optical properties. [1][2][3][4][5][6] However, the effect of nanoparticles on human health remains poorly understood, and recent reports on nanoparticle toxicity have raised safety concerns.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the formation of a corona on the nanoparticle surface is the most important parameter that controls nanoparticle toxicity. [7][8][9][10] The corona arises from the accumulation of adsorbed biomolecules from blood, saliva, synovial \ue104uid or other \ue104uids in the surroundings. Prior studies of corona formation have indicated an association between corona development and the physicochemical parameters of the nanoparticles, such as size, 10 shape, [11][12][13] surface charge, 8 chemical composition 14 and mechanical properties. 12,[15][16][17] However, physicochemical properties alone cannot predict corona formation, as the composition of the corona changes dynamicallyremodelswhen nanoparticles pass through different tissues. The remodelling of the corona is indirectly related to the intrinsic physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, and it depends on the exposure time and type of biomolecules present.\n\nCorona remodelling is attributed to the association and dissociation of proteins, as described by Vroman's model. 18 Vroman's model, which has been veri\ue103ed in vitro [19][20][21][22] and in vivo, 23 postulates that more abundant proteins with low affinity, such as albumin, bind to the surface of nanoparticles during the early stages of adsorption to form a \"so\ue09d\" corona. During the later stages, the proteins that were initially adsorbed are replaced by less abundant proteins with greater affinity, such as apolipoproteins, \ue103brinogen and immunoglobulins, 23 forming a \"hard\" corona. 24 Notably, the type of serum protein and whether it was denatured",

The formation of protein corona is governed by a complex interplay of protein\u2013particle and protein\u2013protein interactions, such as electrostatics, van der Waals, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and solvation. The experimental parameters influencing these interactions, and thus governing the protein corona formation on nanoparticles, are currently poorly understood. This lack of understanding is due to the complexity in the surface charge distribution and anisotropic shape of the protein molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of pH and salinity on the characteristics of corona formed by myoglobin on silica nanoparticles. We experimentally measure and theoretically model the adsorption isotherms of myoglobin binding to silica nanoparticles. By combining adsorption studies with surface electrostatic mapping of myoglobin, we demonstrate that a monolayered hard corona is formed in low salinity dispersions, which transforms into a multilayered hard + soft corona upon the addition of salt. We attribute the observed changes in protein adsorption behavior with increasing pH and salinity to the change in electrostatic interactions and surface charge regulation effects. This study provides insights into the mechanism of protein adsorption and corona formation on nanoparticles, which would guide future studies on optimizing nanoparticle design for maximum functional benefits and minimum toxicity.",

The interactions between NPs and plasma proteins at the nano-bio interface affect their biopharmaceutical properties and distribution in the organ and tissues due to protein corona (PrC) composition, and in turn, modification of the resulting targeting capability. Moreover, lipid and polymer NPs, at their interface, affect the composition of PrC and the relative adsorption and abundance of specific proteins. To investigate this latter aspect, we synthesized and characterized different liposomal formulations (LFs) with lipids and polymer-conjugated lipids at different molar ratios, having different sizes, size distributions and surface charges. The PrC composition of various designed LFs was evaluated ex vivo in human plasma by label-free quantitative proteomics. We also correlated the relative abundance of identified specific proteins in the coronas of the different LFs with their physicochemical properties (size, PDI, zeta potential). The evaluation of outputs from different bioinformatic tools discovered protein clusters allowing to highlight: (i) common as well as the unique species for the various formulations; (ii) correlation between each identified PrC and the physicochemical properties of LFs; (iii) some preferential binding determined by physicochemical properties of LFs; (iv) occurrence of formulation-specific protein patterns in PrC. Investigating specific clusters in PrC will help decode the multivalent roles of the protein pattern components in the drug delivery process, taking advantage of the bio-nanoscale recognition and identification for significant advances in nanomedicine.",

            "text": "In recent years, both scientific and commercial applications of nanoparticles (NPs) and other nanomaterials have been increasing at a rapid pace [1,2]. Human health can be adversely affected by NP exposure. A profound assessment of these risks, however, is not yet available because fundamental interactions of nanomaterials with biomatter are still not fully understood [ [3][4][5]. Specifically, further detailed mechanistic knowledge at the molecular level is required. \n\nDue to their small size of 1-100 nm, NPs may spontaneously enter the human body through the lung, gut or skin [6][7][8][9][10]. Upon incorporation, NPs come into contact with extracellular fluids such as blood plasma or lung epithelial lining fluid, which contain a huge variety of dissolved biomolecules including lipids and proteins. These can adsorb onto the NP surface and completely enshroud the NP, forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [11][12][13][14][15]. Protein adsorption onto NPs is governed by chemical kinetics. Thus, the initial binding events involve predominantly the more abundant and mobile proteins. If these proteins do not bind too tightly (so that their residence times on the NP do not exceed the relevant time scales), they may be subsequently replaced by less prevalent proteins having a higher binding affinity (Vroman effect [16]). Thus, given that the rate coefficients governing protein binding and unbinding are of suitable magnitude, one may observe an initial, shortlived \"soft corona\" that subsequently develops into a long-lived \"hard corona\". In this context, \"long-lived\" refers to a residence time of the proteins on the NP surface longer than the duration of the experiment. Depending on the nature of the bonds (covalent, ionic, hydrophobic, etc.) between the protein and NP surface, the characteristic time scales of protein adsorption and desorption can vary widely.",

About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become the dominant drug delivery technology in industry, holding the promise to deliver RNA to up- or down-regulate any protein of interest. LNPs have been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting, in which LNP\u2019s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. In a popular approach, physicochemical targeting is accomplished by formulating with charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids localize LNPs to the spleen, and positively charged lipids to the lungs. Here we found that lung-tropic LNPs employing cationic lipids induce massive thrombosis. We demonstrate that thrombosis is induced in the lungs and other organs, and greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to fibrinogen and inducing platelet and thrombin activation. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions which enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while not inducing thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with cationic components and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.",

Proteins conduct cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and provide mechanical support besides having an essential role in mediating biological responses. [183] [186] Nanoparticles interact with various active biomolecules after coming in contact with body fluids. [187,188] rotein adsorption is the first event occurring after nanomaterials (e.g., MBGs) meet protein-containing biological fluids (e.g., blood plasma) loading for the formation of a dynamic surface layer of proteins on pristine nanoparticles, called protein corona, playing a vital role in the interaction between the nanoparticles and the body. [189] Protein corona formation is influenced by the nanoparticles' physicochemical characteristics, proteins properties, and surrounding media bioenvironment (Figure 16). [190,191] e formation of the protein corona, as a complex phenomenon, becomes more distinctive with decreasing particle size. As the particle size reduces, the surface-to-volume ratio rises, nanoparticles show more surface activity and reduce their surface energy through interaction with biological fluids components, including proteins. [192] Even though various parameters influence the formation and composition of the protein corona, this phenomenon becomes considerable when the particle size reduces to a certain extent (e.g., <100 nm). [193,194] Surface textures (e.g., mesoporous structure, porosity, and pore size) are a decisive factor determining the scale of surface areas that interact with the protein molecules. Surface texture variation results in alteration of surface-related parameters, mainly specific surface area. 197] Meanwhile, pore size sieves protein molecules penetrated to the pores and larger pore sizes facilitate adsorption of proteins with high molecular weight (e.g., bone morphogenic protein); therefore, pore size determines protein adsorption in a protein sizedependent manner. [198,199] anoparticles chemical properties can also influence protein corona formation through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. Electrostatic interactions can either enhance or suppress protein adsorption determined by the chemical nature of nanoparticle surface and types of protein. [200]",

The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

            "text": "Considering the known obstacles that limit the development of therapeutic LNPs as the new identity acquired by these LNPs when they come into contact with biological fluids, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the powerful nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) method in serum. An increase in the mean size and a decrease in the particle concentration over time was correlated with important protein adsorption on LNPs from which C14 lipids-PEG were desorbed. On the contrary, for the C18 lipids-PEG LNPs, the size remained constant and the concentration did not decrease, demonstrating a stronger anchor of C18 lipid-PEG and a longer stealth effect. That method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the different behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins' interactions and could be used to screen new formulations in order to predict their possible fate prior to in vivo testing. \n\nRegarding the tested formulations including promising ionizable lipids (CSL3 and SM-102), the results confirmed, using live imaging, their high transfection efficacy in tumor MDA-MB-231 expressing cytoplasmic mEmerald cells, even in serum medium. Nevertheless, the use of DSPE-PEG in LNPs still requires optimization in order to avoid negative impacts on transfection in serum medium. CSL3 lipid was also confirmed to",

            "text": "To reach the tumor site, AuNPs must pass through several biological barriers, all of which could potentially affect their anti-tumor capabilities, including drug delivery. These include interaction with the proteins when AuNPs are exposed to biological fluids. When AuNPs are introduced into biological systems, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other biomolecules (like lipids) forming a tightly bound biomolecular (around 20-30 nm thick) corona, termed the protein corona (Figure 1) [49]. Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface [50,51]. The protein corona is made up of both hard and soft layers, depending on the affinity of the proteins for the nanoparticle surface. The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]. In recent decades many studies have tried to explain the protein corona formation [53,54]. According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface [55]. Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]. The resulting NPs coated by PC gain a new biological identity, and this corona is what is ultimately \"seen\" by cells. As a result of the PC layer the behaviors of NPs-interaction with a living system, such as cellular uptake, biodistribution, signaling, circulation lifetime and toxicity-can be modified [52,57].",

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "To understand corona formation, large numbers of data are available on in vitro studies on the nano-biointeractions in the blood, plasma, and serum as well as in a culture medium. The data from in vitro studies recognized the diversity in the structural organization of the living organism [67]. Moreover, few studies have reported that corona formation on nanomaterials is difficult to identify in vivo owing to the trouble in capturing them in the biological system. Given the gaps in the knowledge related to the understanding of the precise nano-biointeractions in vivo, it is no wonder that few NPs have translated from bench to bedside. The dynamic nature of fluid flow (blood) in the human body may cause some stress on NPs and act a source of adsorption of biomolecules [51][52][53]. To enrich the understanding of the impact of fluid flow dynamics on PC formation in a biological medium, investigators explored the role of shear stress on the structural integrity and surface composition of PC. They choose lipid vesicles with different surface chemistries then exposed them to FBS in static and dynamic conditions, both provided by a peristaltic pump. The PC that evolved around un-PEGylated NPs under dynamic conditions recorded a high concentration of apolipoproteins APOA-II, while under static conditions, acute phase proteins and alpha-1-antitrypsin were traced. Surprisingly, in PEGylated NPs, a total of 217 proteins were detected, of which 50% of the proteins involved in the corona were incurred under dynamic conditions and some of the coronated complement protein was identified as C3 and C4 with opsonin activity. This finding is important in relevance to the in vivo condition because a complement protein is largely associated with the clearance of NPs from systemic circulation [68,69]. Braun and colleagues investigated the influence of the dynamic flow conditions on AuNPs that were 13 nm in size with a surface coating of PEG and tannic acid. The dynamic system was designed using a peristaltic pump at a velocity of 0.5 cm/sec. It was established that the PC composition influenced the dynamic flow in synthetic fluids and the alteration in the PC relied highly on the surface designed and the chemistry of the AuNPs [51].",

            "text": "It is now well accepted that foreign surfaces are modified by the adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids in a biological environment, and that cellular responses to materials in a biological medium might reflect the adsorbed biomolecule layer, rather than the material itself [26]. Recently, the concept of the NP-protein corona has been introduced to describe the proteins in association with NPs in biological fluids [27][28][29][30]. The composition of NP corona is flexible and is determined by many affinity constants and concentrations of the components of the blood plasma. One can speculate that in many practically relevant situations, the protein corona is the surface that is exposed to the cell membrane and is the entity the cell protective mechanisms have to deal with. Thus, for most cases it is more likely that the biologically relevant unit is not the particle, but a nanoobject of specified size, shape, and protein corona structure. Naked particle surfaces will have a much greater (non-specific) affinity for the cell surface than a particle hiding behind a corona of \"bystander\" proteins -that is proteins for which no suitable cellular recognition machinery exists. The evidence suggests that, in comparison to typical cell-membrane-biology event timescales the particle corona is likely to be a defining property of the particle in its interactions with the cell surface, whether it activates cellular machinery or not. Similar observations and outcomes exist for particles inside the cell, in key locations, though we cannot discuss details here [27][28][29][30]. We assume that the actual content of the corona is determined by (i) the NP exposure to the protein solution (blood plasma), (ii) a competition between the adsorbed proteins and the glycoproteins/membrane lipids. We will model the protein and lipid interaction with the NP surface at the CG united-atom level for selected set of proteins and lipids (see Table I). These simulations will provide interaction energies and will be used to predict the kinetics of protein/lipid corona formation.",

            "text": "There is currently growing interest in how nanoparticles (NPs) interact with living systems, both from the point of view of the safe implementation of nanotechnology, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] as well as from an improved drug delivery perspective. 8,9 4][25] Consequently, it becomes interesting to correlate NP uptake not to properties of the bare NP, but to properties of the NP-biomolecular corona complex. 26,27  uptake begins with an initial adhesion of the NP to the cell and interactions with the lipids, proteins and other components of the cell membrane. This is followed by the activation of an energy-dependent uptake mechanism, 10,11,14 which allows the NPs to be internalised into the cell and further trafficked to different subcellular locations, typically ending in lysosomal accumulation. 10,28,29 One of the key steps in NP uptake efficiency is therefore the starting NP adhesion to the cell membrane. Previous studies have investigated this aspect, for example by exposing cells to NPs at 4 \u00b0C to inhibit internalisation [30][31][32] , or by dissolving NPs on the outside of the membrane. 15 Information on NP adhesion to membranes composed solely of lipids is also emerging by studying their adsorption onto micron-sized particles coated with lipids. 33 In this work we have investigated the adhesion properties of NPs with a particular emphasis on the effect of the biomolecular corona. Interactions between biomolecules in the corona and corresponding receptors in the cell membrane may trigger biological recognition and uptake of the NP-corona complex. It has, furthermore, been shown that corona biomolecules can interact with membrane receptors to induce cell-signaling response. 34 In both cases, the response is due to a specific interaction between corona biomolecules and components of the cell membrane. However, it is important not to disregard unspecific interactions and the adhesion properties they lead to. Thus NPs with high energy of the bare surface typically adsorb strongly to cell membranes because of unspecific interactions, thereby lowering their surface energy.",

Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

            "text": "Coating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach. Increased circulation times and brain accumulation are reported for PEG-coated NPs prepared from polycyanoacrylate [173][174][175], poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [176,177], polystyrene [176], and other polymers [178], which is associated with the decreased formation of protein corona and evasion of the MPS. PEG density regulates corona formation and, consequently, particle clearance, of which the threshold for rapid clearance is indicated as 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 for PLGA-PG nanoparticles, largely independent of particle size (diameters of 55, 90, and 140 nm) [177]. No distinguishable difference regarding the composition of the protein corona was observed, although Apo E amounts decrease with increasing PEG density. Moreover, 100 nm diameter polystyrene NPs coated with nine PEG chains per 100 nm 2 showed good diffusion in rat brain tissue ex vivo, as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, as compared with particles with lower densities. Even below the PEG density threshold reported by Bertrand et al., brain diffusion appears to benefit from increased PEG density, which may be attributed to the higher quantity of Apo E in the protein corona and reduced adhesiveness [176,177]. Other surface modification methods to control protein corona formation are surface charge and hydrophobicity modulation [179][180][181]. \n\nParticles' mechanical properties also result in different protein corona profiles, which may affect uptake, toxicity, transport across the BBB, and brain accumulation [44,48,182,183]. Protein adsorption is lower for softer particles, which ultimately leads to a reduced impact of corona-related particle-cell interactions [183,184]. \n\nTargeting capabilities of ligand-decorated NPs are likewise also affected by the presence of a protein corona [75]. Corona formation and the effects on targeting have been evaluated for PEGylated polystyrene NPs functionalized with Tf [74].",

We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

Several environmental parameters (Fig. 2) affects the formation of PC in vitro particularly the medium surrounding the NPs and the exposure conditions. The biological \ue104uid or the medium is composed of different proteins which are known to control the cellular uptake of NPs. This was explained by Tekie et al. 45 for the uptake of chitosan and carboxylmethyl dextran complexes (MCF7 cell line). Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) enhances the uptake due to the presence of proteins in the serum such as alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins which increase the cell function. Similarly, proteins concentration and exposure time contribute equally to the protein adsorption on NPs. Controlling the PC formation is undoubtedly a challenging task but several results highlight that altering the biological parameters along with the physicochemical properties of NPs enable to forecast the corona formation. As analyzed by Partikel et al. 46 , proteins adsorption on poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs depends on the serum type and concentration. In addition, human serum was shown to signi\ue103cantly modify the corona composition resulting in a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins along with the adsorption of high affinity proteins with lower abundance. In addition, time-dependent cell interaction both in the absence and the presence of a preformed corona showed a signi\ue103cant in\ue104uence on a human liver cancer cell line (HepG2) in which the presence of corona increases the cell interaction compared to bare NPs which results in a higher uptake of NPs. Temperature and pH are also important factors in the interaction of NPs with proteins. Galdino et al. 47 explained that pH in\ue104uences the protein adsorption in the Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and SiO 2 NPs system. They concluded that enthalpy controls the interaction along with an electrostatic contribution that can be altered by changing pH. Gorshkov et al. 48 further explained that by varying pH and temperature in the human blood plasma and a silver NPs system, different tertiary protein structures and charge localizations are observed.

The biomolecules present in the blood stream, especially the protein, are quickly adsorbed onto the nanoparticles and form a complex called \"corona.\" The formation of protein corona alters the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and modulates the way they interact with the biological system and defines the biological fate of the nanomaterial. Generally, protein corona formed on the surface of nanoparticles is categorized into two layers: \"hard\" and \"soft\" corona (Fig. 7a). Hard corona proteins strongly adhere onto the nanoparticle surface, whereas soft corona proteins are loosely bound and are later replaced by strong-affinity proteins (Fig. 7b).

First relations between NP and protein properties and the resulting corona have been established amongst which the effect of Coulomb interactions between NP surfaces and charged patches on protein surfaces deserve special attention. The influence of this factor on the proteins affinity to the NP surface but also on the nature of the resulting corona and on cellular uptake has been demonstrated and the extent of this effect is indeed striking. A major challenge in this respect is the link between the results from the idealized conditions of biophysical experiments and the full complexity of the physiological situation. To identify and understand the individual factors governing this behavior is therefore an important task for future research in this field. Understanding the delicate interplay of these individual contributions in shaping the physiological situation is of paramount importance, yet, the long and continuing struggle of statistical mechanics in fully explaining the ensemble observations of thermodynamics serves as an impressive reminder of the complexity that can arise from attempting such seemingly trivial links. \n\nThe fact that the serum corona shows the complex temporal effects discussed above which cannot fully be explained on a molecular scale further underscores the complexity of the topic. \n\nUnderstanding the formation and composition of the corona remains a challenging task but also the biological consequences of the corona and its composition need to be revealed in detail. Establishing structure function-relationships linking NP properties to biological response therefore remains a still distant goal despite the considerable achievements of the past years.

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

Indeed the formation of a biomolecular layer (or corona) changes the original size, surface charge, aggregation state, and surface properties of NPs. 13,14 In other words, the presence of a biomolecular corona (BC) turns the \"synthetic identity\" of NPs into a new \"biological identity\" that ultimately determines their biological fates including their pharmacokinetics. [12][13][14][15][16][17] As the corona represents the biological interface that mediates the interactions between NPs and living cells, it strongly affects the NPs' efficiency as a carrier and release platform of therapeutic agents. 18,19 In fact, the BC plays a key role in many biological processes, e.g. cell internalization, endocytic pathways and intracellular trafficking. 16,[20][21][22] For these reasons, scienti\ue103c interest in the BC has been increasing over the years and different studies have elucidated the role of NPs' physicochemical properties, environmental conditions (e.g., incubation temperature), and biomolecular sources (e.g., human serum vs. human plasma; human plasma vs. mouse plasma etc.) in the biological identity of NPs. 12,17,23,24 Although several ignored factors (e.g., personalized protein corona, 25 plasma concentration, 26 incubation temperature, 27 local temperature induced by plasmonic NPs, 28 metabolome corona, 29 cell vision, 30 and cell sex 31 ) have been introduced into the nano-bio interfaces community, there is still",

Undoubtedly, this protein (biological macromolecule) can mask several physicochemical properties (such as the surface charge and solubility) of nanoparticles and make them recognizable to the immune system, which may neutralize them before they reach the target site [65]. The covering of nanoparticles with these proteins largely determines their biological identities and further fate-their distribution through tissues and organs, their rate of excretion from the body, and their opsonization (phagocytosis involving membrane receptors). This is the key factor causing differences in the performance of nanoparticles within in vitro and in vivo [66] studies, where nanoparticles indicate good results in the first case and usually are worse or non-effective in living organisms [67,68]. \n\nHowever, the composition, density, and mechanism of formation of this macromolecular layer depends not only on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles, association/dissociation constants, competitive binding processes, and species of proteins in the biological medium but also on where the nanoparticle is located [69,70]. \n\nThe formation of this protein corona depends not only on the composition of the nanoparticle-its size, shape, surface state, and exposure time-but also on the type of media, the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio, and the presence of ions and other molecular species that interfere in the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles [71]. \n\nCareful modulation of the protein corona through the tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters may allow nanoparticles to be delivered optimally in tumor tissue [72].",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of the protein corona and its evolution with time have been shown to affect the behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments to a large extent [1,11,28,162]. Our current understanding suggests that initially a \"soft\" protein corona, with a highly dynamic exchange of proteins, is formed around NPs. Changing its composition over time, the \"soft\" corona slowly evolves to a \"hard\" corona with less dynamic exchange [112,162,163]. Previous studies investigating nanomaterial exposure to complex biological environments [3,8,41,112,162] have largely failed to allow for the highly dynamic situation of physiological systems. Coronacarrying NPs may need to instantly react to external stimuli under such conditions as exemplified by considering the blood system where processes controlling haemostasis and thrombosis may be triggered on a timescale of minutes [28]. \n\nTenzer and co-workers [10] recently developed a new experimental approach allowing for a time-resolved determination of NP-specific fingerprints. This method, based on label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), allows for an insight into the time-evolution of the full serum protein corona. Such information, especially for short exposure times, is urgently needed to understand the interactions between NPs and biological systems. Briefly, they used their LC-MS based method to measure time-resolved corona compositions on silica and polystyrene NPs in human serum. By using NPs of various sizes (diameters of about 35, 120, 140 nm), and surface functionalities (amine, carboxylate, unmodified), they were able to provide insights into the consequences of these factors for corona composition and dynamics. \n\nThey demonstrated in their study that coronas were formed very rapidly, and showed an unexpected complexity regarding composition and dynamics on all of the NPs under investigation. They quantitatively detected 166 different plasma proteins within the corona after 0.5 min. The number of individual proteins quantified in the corona increased to almost 300 on the different types of NPs at prolonged exposure times (up to 480 min).",

Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes.",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a).

NPs can aggregate with other biomolecules such as organic compounds, carbohydrates, and lipids. However, the majority of bio-coronas are protein coronas, 60,61 which are dynamically formed in vivo and undergo changes in composition over time. 1,15,57 Time-dependent corona formation is defined by the Vroman effect, 62,63 which explains how fibrinogen at the surface of materials may be replaced by other high-affinity proteins. That is, abundant proteins are nonspecifically adsorbed on the surface of NPs immediately after their in vivo administration. Most of these proteins may have low affinity for NPs and may be released from the complex and replaced by those with higher affinity after a long exposure time. 64 This weakly bound layer is called a \"soft\" corona, while the strongly bound layer is called a \"hard\" corona. [64][65][66] The composition of soft and hard corona is affected by many factors, such as the surface characteristics, biological environment around NPs, times of exposure, and physiochemical properties of NPs.\n\nProtein corona formation is highly related to the functionality and activity of NPs in either a positive or negative manner. 13 Which of the strongly or weakly bound proteins influences the biological functions of NPs is still unclear. Weber et al have suggested the role of hard corona proteins, such as immunoglobulin G and clusterin, in the internalization of NPs into cells. 67",

            "text": "rin, the time needed is approximately 0.2 min [61].  A slight increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles was observed. The major variation was showed for NP-DMSA (from 32 to 67 nm), probably due to its stronger negative surface charge compared with PEG-coated NPs. In the case of PEG-conjugated particles, they exhibited a size increase from 67 to 113 nm. As observed in Figure 2b, the size distribution of the nanoparticles remained relatively stable up to 30 min and below 200 nm in physiological conditions, which is an important requirement for in vivo intravenous administration. Kinetic studies showed a rapid formation of the protein corona. In all cases, the increase in hydrodynamic size was observed after 1 min of incubation of the NPs in presence of plasma. An atomistic description of such a complex mechanism of formation and evolution of the protein corona around the NPs is, at the moment, unfeasible. Nevertheless, some computational simulations and in vitro experiments have been used to describe the interaction between NPs and a few components of the plasma [60,61]. The mechanism of formation of the corona around the NP can be divided in to two main steps: (a) the NPs enter in the biological media and encounter biomolecules that first adsorb forming the initial corona and (b) the corona composition changes dynamically due to the competition between proteins. Also, protein-protein interactions may affect the overall kinetics of this process. For example, in the case of silica-coated NPs, the time needed to achieve 50% of the surface coated with Human serum albumin (HSA) is around 0.1 min, whilst if the analysis is done with HSA and transferrin, the time needed is approximately 0.2 min [61].",

            "text": "Investigations on protein coatings of nano-entities in biological fluids began already in the late 1970s, [218] but intensive research on the topic started only in 2007, when Dawson and co-workers first coined the term protein corona. [219] The latter is described as \"the spontaneous adsorption of biomolecules on the surface of nanoparticles in a biological environment\", [26] for example, proteins and lipids, among others (Figure 13). This process is driven by a series of attractive intermolecular forces, often acting in parallel: electrostatic and hydrophobic forces, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and disulfide interactions. [220] The evolution of the protein corona over time is usually described in terms of the Vroman effect: the smaller the size, the higher the diffusion rates and the concentration, the faster a protein will adsorb on a NP surface. Gradually, this first layer of proteins will be replaced by other proteins, which have higher affinity (higher binding constants) for the specific NP surface. [221] Serum albumin and globulins belong to the first group of proteins, whereas apolipoproteins are examples of proteins with higher binding affinity to hydrophobic surfaces. The particular identity of a protein corona depends mainly on four factors: i) physicochemical characteristics of the NP system (shape, size, composition), ii) chemical properties of the medium (pH, ionic strength, temperature), iii) composition of the biological milieu (nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, etc.), and iv) administration route. The latter determines which fluids and biological compartments the NPs come into contact with and in which order, leading in some cases to multiple parallel displacement equilibria, which partially alter the corona composition. The protein corona can thus also be seen as a memory of the biological fate of an NP system, if one can identify all its components. [222] n their recent review article, Sudheesh and co-workers (2017) questioned whether the protein corona on nanoparticles might be the missing link between in vitro and in vivo correlations, [26] and emphasised the need for a better understanding of the interactions at the bio-nano interface, although this is an extremely challenging task.",

Obviously, plasma proteins cannot be avoided when nanoparticles are administered intravenously in patients, and the grafting of PEG or other polymers onto nanoparticle surfaces may reduce, but will not completely prevent protein corona formation [35]. Therefore, the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules needs to be taken into account in the design of any nanoparticle for clinical use, and the formation of a (specific) corona could also be exploited to confer novel advantageous properties to nanoparticles [11]. The present proteomics study has provided an inventory of human plasma proteins with affinity for silica-and dextran-coated SPIONs that may prove useful in further optimization of SPIONs for medical imaging.",

A simplistic diffusion-based approach was put forward by Leo Vroman that described adsorption kinetics of proteins for several \ue104at and curved NPs surfaces. The Vroman effect states that during NPs incubation in a complex multiprotein system, the high mobility proteins (having low molecular weight) arrive \ue103rst and adsorb on the NPs surface, in the due course of time the adsorbed proteins are replaced by more stable less mobile proteins that have a higher binding affinity for the NPs. 21,22 To put it simply, a critical balance between the kinetics and thermodynamics of proteins determines the corona formation on the NPs surface. In another theory put forward by Hirish et al. it is described that the entire dynamic exchange occurs via the formation of \"transient complex\". Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis suggest that adsorption of the initial layer of proteins is followed by the embedding of the second layer of  Review RSC Advances protein which in turn results in a formation of multilayered aggregate. The aggregated complex (transient complex) \ue103nally exposes the initially adsorbed proteins which desorb from the NPs surface into the solution leaving the NPs with the proteins. 23 A better understanding of the evolution of protein corona is explained by the dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) which combines the steric and electrostatic interactions.",

To resolve this, Vilaseca et al. developed CG models of HSA, FG, and IgG as simple shapes, and showed that small (HSA) and large (FG) proteins do not compete with each other, but rather compete with others (IgG) in a cooperative way, which supports the Vroman effect [59]. Vilanova et al. also developed CG models for protein-silica NP and protein-protein interactions, showing that three-body interactions can be applied to capture the kinetics of the competitive adsorption of plasma proteins, such as HSA, TF, and FG, which successfully reproduces the experimental observation regarding the replacement of abundant proteins (HSA and TF) with high-affinity proteins (FG) at the early stage of corona formation (Figure 8) [60]. In particular, the adsorption kinetics and compositions of HSA, TF, and FG agree with the experimental results, showing the ability of the CG model (three-body interaction) to predict the kinetics and composition of protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces [60]. Tavanti et al. performed CG simulations of multiple insulin and FG molecules that were adsorbed onto 5 nm-sized citrate-capped AuNPs, and showed that 20 insulin and three FG molecules bind to the AuNP surface, indicating the difference of their binding affinity [61]. In particular, insulin has the specific binding site, while FG has various binding sites, depending on the protein concentration and composition [61]. The presence of FG induces less adsorption of insulin, showing the adsorption competition between insulin and FG [61].",

            "text": "The use of PPEs in drug delivery requires their circulation in the bloodstream for a certain time to be recognized by immune cells or target cells. The polymer interactions with the plasma proteins are important to predict the eventual trigger of the immune system, the potential degradation by certain enzymes, and the pathway that leads to the cellular uptake by specific or unspecific recognition. \n\nWhen a nanocarrier enters the bloodstream, it adsorbs proteins on its surfaces, leading to the formation of a protein shell (the so-called \"protein corona\") that alter the properties of the nanocarrier, such as size, charge, interactions with cells [116,117]. In many cases, the nanocarriers' chemical identity with properly installed targeting groups, might be masked by the protein corona and the resulting \"biological identity\" behaves differently as intended. It has been reported by Dawson and co-workers that protein adsorption reduced the efficiency of specific cell targeting [118], therefore the possibility to control the protein corona to permit the use of targeted nanocarriers is one of the current challenges in drug delivery. Some proteins present in the corona could belong to the class of opsonins, namely antibodies, complement or circulating proteins that are responsible for the recognition of a foreign substance by the immune system and the subsequent clearance from the body. The evaluation of the protein corona composition is, therefore, a fundamental task to predict the biological fate of the nanocarrier. \n\nPEG is currently used as a stealth coating for many drugs and nanocarriers as it decreases protein adsorption. However, certain protein types are \"recruited\" from the blood and still assembled on the nanocarriers' surface. This specific protein adsorption is believed to be responsible for the increased blood-half-life. This effect is generally called \"stealth effect\" and has been explained by several theories, linked to the polymer hydrophilicity, absence of charges, flexibility, and capacity of hydration (Fig. 6) [119,120]. All these factors seem to influence the stealth behaviour of a polymer; they also allowed the design of various PEG-alternatives with additional features, such as degradability and chemical functionality.",

(B) Functionalization of antibodies by means of a PEG bridge. Every year, more antibodies are used to functionalize Au NPs. Most of these systems are stabilized with thiolated linkers like PEG chains, which are typically terminated in carboxylic acids or succinimidyl esters that are then activated for the addition of antibodies by forming random amide bonds with free amine residues on the surface of the antibodies. \n\nThe modification of Au NPs or the promotion of self-assembly can be achieved using thiols and protein scaffolds. An alternative approach involves the direct adsorption of proteins onto the Au NP surface, exemplified by the \"crown protein\" (Au NP CP), which garners considerable attention. This entity, governed by biological dynamics, binding affinity and protein adsorption rate, crucially influences the exchange time and lifetime of interfacial interactions. Investigations reveal that the corona protein presence enhances surface free energy, and proteins can be conjugated with Au NPs through glutamic acid. This involves bonding with amino groups and carboxyl groups extending outward, forming connections with protein amino groups [1,98]. \n\nInteraction between Au NPs and proteins (Figure 8A) can induce intrinsic characteristic changes in both. Notably, physiological modifications such as alterations in bound protein structure, complement activation, blood clotting and protein aggregation may arise [100][101][102][103]. The hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of Au NPs plays a regulatory role in the amount and composition of protein adsorption. For instance, hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification results in strong resistance to plasma proteins, such as com-plement subunit adsorption, enabling extended circulation time due to resistance to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [104].",

            "text": "It has recently been recognised that NPs entering biological systems are quickly covered by biomolecules (e.g., plasma proteins) in order to form a protein corona (PC) layer [16,17]. \n\nBased on the affinity, binding, and dissociation rate, protein corona are classified into hard and soft PC [18,19]. The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC [20]. Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment [21]. The system of protein-modified NPs forms a unique biological identity of NPs that determines their interactions with biological systems. PCs are formed on most NPs regardless of their composition and surface properties, while NPs with profound antifouling properties and reduced adsorption of proteins are reportedly rare [22][23][24]. As a result, the physiochemical properties of NPs, such as size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and aggregation state, are altered dramatically. Accordingly, the biological properties of NPs in terms of toxicity, cellular recognition, cellular uptake, blood circulation lifetime, tumour accumulation, and biodistribution are also affected. For example, the PC has been shown to reduce NP adhesion to cell membrane and mitigate the associated cytotoxic effects, which the NP would otherwise exert [25][26][27]. The precoating of NPs with the most abundant plasma protein, albumin, has been demonstrated to halt further protein adsorption, decrease complement activation, prolong blood circulation time, and reduce NP toxicity [28,29].",

            "text": "corona on these NPs. For pSar-NPs this is also in line with the FCS study in full blood by Negwer et al. [42] Concerning the boundary conditions: these results apply after an in vitro incubation of one hour and during a separation protocol, which allows the diffusion of proteins away from the nanoparticle during their flow in PBS buffer. Thus, the AF4 experiment cannot exclude a very weak protein affinity (very soft corona with reversible binding), whereby (primarily) enriched proteins could diffuse away during separation by AF4. In this context it is, however, important to mention that there are good indications that AF4 is capable to isolate the nanoparticles including the soft corona. [26] Also, an in vivo incubation of these nanoparticles in the body could possibly lead to a larger amount of enriched proteins as reported by Dawson, Kostarelos and coworkers for liposomal nanoparticles recollected from the blood of animals [25] and patients. [60] The difference in corona formation compared to colloidal nanocarriers is probably a consequence of the chemical structure of the core crosslinked micellar architectures studied here (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). All studied polymeric nanocarriers provide a dense hydrophilic corona (for a rough estimation of the grafting density see the Supporting Information), which is covalently stabilized by core-crosslinking. Therefore, the studied nanoparticles are of a stable nature in plasma and do not face rearrangements of their internal structure (see ref. [17] and section \"Comparison between nanoparticles with a hard interface and polymeric micellar structures\" in the Supporting Information for discussion). Thus, it is, e.g., not possible that shielding domains may rearrange spontaneously and expose hydrophobic patches, where plasma proteins can adsorb and build up a protein corona irreversibly.\n\nThus, obviously, nanoparticles are not all alike and interact differently with plasma proteins, whereby the variability extends from only some nanoparticles interacting with a protein to the formation of an extensive protein corona on each particle. This also is in agreement with results obtained previously for other systems like nanopar",

This group studied positively and negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles (nPsNPs and pPsNPS, respectively) and silica nanoparticles of various sizes (\u00d8 \u2248 35, 120, and 140 nm), loads, and surface modifications (unmodified amine and carboxylate), exposing them to human plasma for different periods of time. They quantified the formation of 166 different protein coronas every 30 s for PsNPs and silica nanoparticles (35 nm). When modified the surfaces were able to quantify the formation of 300 different protein coronas. \n\nSome authors have pointed out that the protein corona can increase the useful drug load capacity of nanoparticles. The very small size of the nanoparticles facilitates their travel down the bloodstream, their incorporation into cells, and their interaction with the cellular compartments with different molecules, including DNA. A way in which the protein corona can improve not only nanoparticles' drug transporting capacities but also their pharmacokinetic properties is by increasing payload capability through the use of porous materials (e.g., porous silicon) that can be packaged with the drug, as well as through the volume increase of liposomes. However, most current methods, unaware of the formation of the protein corona, typically load the drugs over the nanoparticles surface via chemical conjugation or adsorption. In these cases, the maximum amount that can be charged is restricted to a single layer [90]. Nanoparticles functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been recently \n\ndeveloped. PEG provides colloidal stability even under conditions of physiological salinity caused by interparticle repulsion. However, even complex pegylation is unable to completely prevent the formation of the protein corona, even though the degree of protein adsorption is clearly reduced [91]. \n\nThe adsorption of serum proteins and the formation of a corona are part of the immune response.",

In LNP formulations, the dissociation of the outer PEG layer renders particles vulnerable to opsonization; however, likely increases particle cellular association. Chen et al. showed that substitution of more-rapidly dissociating DMG-PEG; which is included in Moderna's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with longer alkyl tailed DSG-PEG lead to a marked increase in particle circulation times, reduced hepatic uptake and decreased dissociation of other lipid components (Chen et al., 2016). It is possible that shedding of the PEG layer from LNP formulations soon after injection can be beneficial, as PEG enables the LNPs to diffuse away from the injection site, but once shed, enables the LNPs to bind to and be internalized by a range of different cells. \n\nPEG-lipids are commonly attached via amide or ether bonds, which are highly stable and thus difficult to cleave (Fang et al., 2017).

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

It was shown that siRNA-LNP systems containing 10 mol % of DSPC exhibit maximum activity for a size of 80 nm, which suggests that to obtain smaller systems with optimized activity, higher levels of DSPC should be incorporated. 181 This was confirmed in both human adipocytes and hepatocytes, where protein expression levels for 130 nm mRNA-LNP systems differed as much as 50-fold depending on lipid compositions with a constant DLin-MC3-DMA/Chol molar ratio. The results suggest that some of these differences may be attributed to changes in surface composition of the particles and the impact this may have on the ability of LNPs to fuse with the endosomal membrane. 180,181 The proportions of different lipid species in optimized RNA-LNP systems may vary according to the particular ionizable cationic lipid employed (see Table 3). This expands considerably the possible lipid composition of an LNP system but mostly challenges researchers to find the optimal combination for a particular application.

            "text": "The colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs is another critical factor that should be monitored carefully to ensure efficacy of the administered formulation. It is well-known that mRNA nanoparticles may interact with the different bodily biological fluids. This interaction may result in adsorption of biomolecules or endogenous proteins to the surface of the nanoparticles, which leads to formation of a complex known as a bimolecular or protein corona [90]. The formation of a nanoparticle-corona complex may decrease the colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs and lead to particle aggregation and earlier release of the mRNA load [91,92]. Therefore, characterization of LNPs should be carried out in undiluted biological fluids to determine their stability, size, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In this context, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can be used to determine the degree of complexation of mRNA, while the technique of fluorescence single-particle tracking can be adopted for measuring the LNPs' size and their extent of aggregation [91,92]. \n\nModifications of the helper lipid composition of LNPs may also contribute to their stability in serum. For example, incorporation of cholesterol was reported to reduce the permeability and increase the rigidity of the lipid membrane and, therefore, helps to preserve the integrity of LNPs when present in serum [93]. In addition, inclusion of PEGylated lipids in the LNP composition may provide a stealth effect and improve the colloidal stability by reducing the capability of adsorption to plasma protein, thereby avoiding aggregation in the bloodstream. However, LNPs containing PEGylated lipids were reported to exhibit low cellular uptake and transfection [94]. Therefore, careful selection of PEGylated lipids is important in this case. Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid.",

            "text": "After entering the biological system, nanoparticles interact with the biomolecules in the body and will give rise to a layer called the \"corona\". This happens within seconds of nanoparticle exposure by a process called the Vroman effect. This layer consists of many biomolecules with increased adsorption and enhanced properties compared to those in the normal biological environment. Thus, this has a high impact on the ultimate performance of these nanoparticles. The liquid profile and protein composition of this corona layer have been extensively studied with respect to various works. According to the adsorption rate of proteins to their surface, the corona can be classified into two main categories: a hard corona and a soft corona. High affinity proteins tightly and directly associated with nanoparticles will form a hard corona, and low affinity proteins loosely and indirectly associated with nanoparticles will form a soft corona. While taking this into consideration, a hard corona is more convenient in terms of nanotechnology. The structure and composition of the corona layer can be studied by various techniques, such as DLS, SEC, DCS, TEM, PAGE, LC-MS/MS, DC, SPR, ITC, etc. Parameters like the number of bonds, thermodynamic feasibility of interaction, rearrangements of molecules, temperature, conformational changes, solvation, influence of other proteins, etc., determine the nanomaterial\u2212 protein adsorption effect. 11 Generally, there are 3 steps in the protein adsorption to nanoparticles, especially for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Figure :2): \n\n\u2022 Region 1: characterized by protein\u2212NP surface interaction only with original protein conformation. \n\n\u2022 Region 2: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions and protein\u2212NP interactions with changes in its structural conformations. \n\n\u2022 Region 3: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions only, along with structural alterations and protein multilayer formation. \n\nThe composition of the corona is formed by different types of plasma proteins, viz., immunoglobulins, tissue leakage proteins, complement factors, coagulants, lipoproteins, and other serum components. They are collectively called \"adsorbomes\" after the adsorption mechanism.",

            "text": "The use of short lipids-PEG able to quickly dissociate is therefore one of the preferred options to target the liver [34]. In vivo, it was then proved that nanoparticles with DMG-PEG anchor have no prolonged circulation time compared with the same particles grafted with C18-PEG, while the latter demonstrated higher stability in serum and tumor accumulation [33,35]. More recently, DMG-PEG 2000 was used in the COVID-19 Spikevax \u00ae vaccine [36], considering that an extended residence time could lead to undesirable inflammation at the injection site [37], and because, despite the lack of information, opsonization of the LNPs could also help to stimulate the immune system by promoting uptake by innate immune cells [38]. The formation of a protein corona around LNPs can therefore be seen either as a limitation or as an opportunity, depending on the application. In this context, the developed NTA method could be used to quickly screen new LNPs formulations and facilitate the rapid translation from in vitro to clinic. Its ease of implementation (low required volumes and materials) and its benefits over traditional methods to separate LNPs bound to proteins from free proteins make of this method an interesting tool. Indeed, separation methods no longer reflect the practical in vivo dynamic equilibrium between the adsorption and desorption of proteins, or the establishment of a soft corona around the high affinity proteins directly grafted around LNPs forming the hard corona [2]. \n\nThe impact of these lipids-PEG and of ionizable lipids on cellular metabolic activity was studied in tumor HeLa and HepG2 cells. In serum-free medium, LNPs induced low or no toxicity. In contrast, when used in the presence of serum, a significant impact of SM-102 LNPs with Cer-, DMG-and DTA-PEG on the metabolic activity of cells was noticed, predominantly in HepG2 cells. Considering the previously mentioned rapid desorption of C14 lipid-PEG in serum, it could be hypothesized that the transfection of cells with SM-102 LNPs lacking PEG could disturb cell metabolic activity.",

            "text": "The work showed that cationic lipids activated Toll-receptor 4, expressed on leucocytes, in a specific manner. [81]To address this issue, ionizable cationic lipids have been successfully developed and used in clinical products, i.e., Onpattro and the two COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.As reported in the literature, although the ionizable cationic lipids displayed improved efficacy over permanently charged lipids, individuals subjected to LNP-mRNA vaccines displayed side effects such as local pain, fever, swelling, and systemic inflammatory responses. [82]n addition, PEGylated lipids, which are typically used to increase the stability and circulation half-life of LNPs, induce the secretion of anti-PEG antibodies that may cause hypersensitivity reactions as well as the activation of the complement system. [83]This increases the risk of undesirable clearance of the nanoparticles, reducing the antitumor efficacy. [83]Nevertheless, PEG has been widely employed to coat the surface of lipid-based nanotherapeutics used in clinic, including Doxil, Onivyde, and Onpattro. [84]Several studies have focused on the role of PEG coating on nanoparticle interactions with immune cells, and their outcomes can be leveraged to improve the formulation of LNPs and maximize their association with the desired immune system components.For instance, varying PEG architecture influenced nanoparticle association with monocytes and ultimately their biological behavior in blood. [85]In addition, PEG-coated nanoparticles incubated ex vivo with plasma samples from various donors formed personalized coronas, which correlated with the blood immune cell interactions of nanoparticles. [86]Reports have also suggested the use of PEG alternatives, such as polysarcosine, which have similar physicochemical properties to PEG but are less immunogenic, and thus may potentially replace PEG in LNPmediated mRNA delivery.

            "title": "Biomolecular corona on nanoparticles: a survey of recent literature and its implications in targeted drug delivery",
            "text": "A recent report by Tenzer et al., found that the biomolecular corona forms almost instantaneously (in less than 30 s) and is comprised of almost 300 different proteins, although it typically consists of a similar set of proteins in various quantities (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, it has been suggested that NPs cannot accommodate as many proteins on their surfaces and a significantly lower number of proteins are present because current analyses are performed over large numbers of NPs and represent macroscopic averages of protein composition (Monopoli et al., 2012). The \"hard\" corona is the first layer of the corona, consisting of tightly and nearly irreversibly bound biomolecules. Atop the hard corona lie the \"soft\" corona layers that are composed of more leniently associated biomolecules classified by rapid exchange rates. With increasing time, less abundant, less mobile, and higher binding affinity proteins will subsequently replace the highly abundant, lower affinity proteins (Vroman effect) (Vroman et al., 1980). However, a recent study questioned the applicability of the Vroman effect to NPs and found that the composition of the hard corona was constant over time although the total amount of adsorbed proteins was changed (Tenzer et al., 2013). Properties of NPs such as size and surface hydrophobicity have also been demonstrated to affect the composition and exchange rates of proteins such as transferrin (Tf) and albumin (Ashby et al., 2014). \n\nAlthough the formation of the biomolecular corona is unavoidable and plays a significant role in determining the biological behaviors of NPs, its importance has only recently received significant scientific attention. This mini review describes the importance of the NP-biomolecule corona on determining biological responses, supported by a number of recently published reports. We will succinctly cover important aspects related to biomolecular corona formation, how it is influenced by various physicochemical properties of NPs, the impact of NPs on the structure of proteins, and the impact of the biomolecular corona on the biological interactions of NPs.",

            "title": "Effect of PEG Anchor and Serum on Lipid Nanoparticles: Development of a Nanoparticles Tracking Method",
            "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Centralized platforms that offer guidance for nanoformulations could significantly accelerate research initiatives [34]. Carbon-based NMs, including graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and fullerenes, have garnered considerable attention because of their remarkable properties and potential applications across various fields, particularly in biomedicine. Comprehending how they interact with plasma proteins is essential for evaluating their cytotoxicity and biocompatibility with biological systems [12,35,36] and their prospective use in biomedical applications. Blood plasma proteins are generally categorized into three main groups: albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen, with albumins being the most prevalent [37]. \n\nThe protein corona is a layer of biomolecules, primarily composed of proteins, that form around NPs when they enter a biological environment. This layer emerges as a result of protein adsorption onto the NP surface. The formation of the protein corona significantly influences the behavior, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity of NPs within biological systems [12,[38][39][40][41][42][43]. Understanding the protein corona is essential for the development of effective NP-based drug delivery systems and other biomedical applications. The key factors that influence protein corona formation include the following (Table 1): NP characteristics, the physicochemical properties of the NPs, the environmental conditions, the protein binding affinities, the duration of NP exposure to the biological environment, the Vroman effect, and the protein concentration. These factors collectively determine the nature, composition, and biological implications of the protein corona surrounding NPs. The protein corona affects NP behavior in several significant ways, as shown in Figure 1 [12], which depicts the mechanisms and implications of this effect.",

            "text": "the immune equilibrium.\n\nAfter many groups have observed the presence of plasma proteins as 'contaminants' in their EV samples, here we provide evidence for a protein corona formation around EVs. This corona formation may occur universally in biofluids and components of the corona might be characteristic for the surrounding matrix. The mechanism behind this corona formation presumably involve protein aggregation and electrostatic interactions as well. However, beside this non-specific passive adsorption of proteins on the surface of EVs, specific, receptor-ligand interactions may also play a role in corona protein-EV surface association. Based on our observations, we may consider the 'contaminating' corona proteins as inevitable external molecular components of EVs.\n\nAlthough in the present study we only analysed protein coronas of mEVs, data published by others strongly suggest similar protein interactions with the surface of small EVs (sEVs) as well. As an example, the group of C. Th\u00e9ry demonstrated the association of several serum and ECM proteins (e.g., albumin, complement proteins, prothrombin and fibronectin) with what they called 'dense sEVs' , EVs with enhanced floatation density (Kowal et al., 2016). This is similar to our results showing that 'coated mEVs' had a higher floatation density as compared to 'nascent' ones. Another published indication of the association of bovine plasma proteins with sEVs has been published recently upon affinity-based EV isolation (Nakai et al., 2016).\n\nAn unexpected finding of our current study was the abundance of protein aggregates in pellets after centrifugation of EVDP at medium speed (12,500 g 40 min). This protein aggregate formation was observed in EVDP samples even after six consecutive rounds of 12,500 g centrifugation. This was in spite of that the EV-depletion of plasma samples included a serial filtration of PFPs through 5 \u03bcm and 0.8 \u03bcm filters followed by a 40 min 20,000 g and an overnight 100,000 g centrifugation. The finding that the EVDP was an almost unlimited source of protein aggregates even at the low speed commonly used to separate mEVs, points to the importance of careful characterization of blood plasma-derived EVs.",

            "text": "molecular corona are formed (Nel et al., 2009;Monopoli et al., 2012;Shemetov et al., 2012;Hadjidemetriou and Kostarelos, 2017). Until now, the protein corona (PC) is the most important class of biomolecular corona formed and has mostly been studied. Before the PC was proposed in 2007, ENPs had been considered to interact with living cells directly, and the physiochemical properties of the pristine ENPs were considered to determine their biological effects (Cedervall et al., 2007). However, this understanding is far from the truth. After exposed to a complete cell culture medium in vitro or blood in vivo, tens of thousands of proteins immediately reached onto the outlayer of ENPs and PC were formed in a dynamic process . According to the relative affinity, PC was divided into hard and soft types (Docter et al., 2015;Kokkinopoulou et al., 2017). Hard corona is made by a protein fraction strongly bound to the surface, while soft corona is formed by loosely bound proteins, maybe via protein-protein interaction. PC significantly alters the identity of ENPs, including physicochemical properties and the bioidentity of ENPs Liu et al., 2020;Szekeres et al., 2020). First, PC formation alters the size, zeta potential, morphology, and aggregation states of ENPs. Second, PC formation alters the interactions between ENPs and physiological systems, and the subsequent biobehaviors of ENPs (Chinen et al., 2017;Nayak et al., 2019). For example, adsorption of opsonin proteins enhanced the cellular uptake of ENPs by phagocytes, and subsequently accelerate the clearance (Vu et al., 2019). In addition, special protein can be recruited by ENPs with special properties which give ENPs specificity capacity (Wang et al., 2017). Therefore, investigation of interaction mechanism between ENPs and protein molecules and its biological effects is critical to understand the interactions between ENPs and living organisms, which is of great significance for evaluating the safety of ENPs and the application of ENPs in biomedical field.\n\nUntil now, most of studies are investigated on the PC",

            "text": "In the last few decades, nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery platforms have improved the therapeutic index of many drugs. In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "text": "The protein corona acquired by nanoparticles within the first few hours of injection largely dictates their biological identity and affects their performance [78]. Control over protein corona formation and composition is therefore therapeutically relevant and has historically been reduced through PEGylation to prevent nanoparticle clearance. Interestingly, PEG often comprises the entire surface of polymersomes due to its incorporation into the block copolymer, while the degree of PEGylation for liposomes is limited to low molecular ratios [79]. Consequently, the polymersome surface most likely constitutes of dense PEG chains in 'brush' conformation, which may result in a distinct biological identity compared to that of liposomes with PEG chains in a collapsed 'mushroom' state. Nevertheless, the biological identity of PEGbased polymersomes has not been fully elucidated yet and may also depend on interactions between physicochemical properties, including surface chemistry and functionalization. \n\nRecently, Scott and colleagues have made initial steps towards controlling the biological identity of PEG-based polymersomes. They screened a small library composed of PEG-PPS micelles, polymersomes and filomicelles functionalized with methoxy, hydroxy or phosphate end groups to study the effect of surface chemistry and morphology on protein corona formation and composition [80]. Protein corona quantification and identification via proteomics revealed that human plasma proteins most abundantly adsorb to negatively charged phosphate surfaces, whereas the relatively inert methoxy end group displayed very low protein adsorption. A more detailed investigation into the protein corona composition disclosed a complex interplay between surface chemistry and morphology, of which the former largely dictated nanoparticle immunogenicity (i.e. complement activation) and the latter determined uptake by cells of the MPS. This suggests that the morphology-dependent biodistribution described in the previous sections is at least partially explained by a difference in biological identity [80]. Remarkably, regardless of surface chemistry, polymersomes adsorbed the most proteins associated with clearance by the MPS. \n\nThese findings suggest that PEG-based polymersomes intrinsically show enhanced internalization by immune cells because of a certain protein corona composition. So, their biological identity Fig. 3. | Overview of polymersomes with surface functionalization applicable in cancer immunotherapy.",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

            "text": "These simulations will provide interaction energies and will be used to predict the kinetics of protein/lipid corona formation. The data on aminoacid interaction with NP will allow us to compute binding affinities of arbitrary proteins of known structure within an additive model implying that the total protein-NP interaction energy is computed as a sum of NP interactions with aminoacids in contact with NP surface. This assumption will be further verified by comparison with results of large scale molecular dynamics simulations for a few selected protein types and mean force potential calculations. From the typical protein concentrations and adsorption energies one can also predict the average content of the corona using ideal adsorbed solution theory [31]. It is important to understand that at this stage we would be able neither to scan all the plasma proteins nor to take into account any change of protein conformation or bonding between the adsorbed proteins. However, as the effect of the corona is still largely unknown, we can only hope to capture the most important contributions of the plasma protein to the NP dispersion stability and their interaction with the cell membrane. \n\nDue to complexity of blood plasma, we can only model it at a simplified level. It seems reasonable to include the elements, which are more likely to affect the NP interactions and aggregation, and mediate their interaction with the membrane. The plasma can then be modelled a solution of biomolecules in an implicit solvent with a dielectric constant of water and the Debye length corresponding to physiological ionic strength, van der Waals interactions set to corresponding triplets NP-protein-water, or protein-water-protein, and appropriate surface charges on the molecules. In this work we study the adsorption of two of the most abundant proteins in blood plasma, Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and Fibrinogen (Fib). In Table I, we summarize their relative content in blood and their molar mass. Although this two proteins represent are important components of the blood plasma because of their abundance, recent observations [27][28][29]32] demonstrate that the protein corona can include hundreds of different plasma proteins. As of now, it is not known which proteins dominate the content of the corona or play the most crucial role in the NP coating and uptake.",

            "text": "The growing risk of human exposure to airborne nanoparticles (NPs) causes a general concern on the biosafety of nanotechnology. Inhaled NPs can deposit in the deep lung at which they interact with the pulmonary surfactant (PS). Despite the increasing study of nano-bio interactions, detailed molecular mechanisms by which inhaled NPs interact with the natural PS system remain unclear. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we studied the interaction between NPs and the PS system in the alveolar fluid. It was found that regardless of different physicochemical properties, upon contacting the PS, both silver and polystyrene NPs are immediately coated with a biomolecular corona that consists of both lipids and proteins. Structure and molecular conformation of the PS corona depend on the hydrophobicity of the pristine NPs. Quantitative analysis revealed that lipid composition of the corona formed on different NPs is relatively conserved and is similar to that of the bulk phase PS. However, relative abundance of the surfactant-associated proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C, is notably affected by the hydrophobicity of the NP. The PS corona provides the NPs with a physicochemical barrier against the environment, equalizes the hydrophobicity of the pristine NPs, and may enhance biorecognition of the NPs. These modifications in physicochemical properties may play a crucial role in affecting the biological identity of the NPs and hence alter their subsequent interactions with cells and other biological entities. Our results suggest that all studies of inhalation nanotoxicology or NP-based pulmonary drug delivery should consider the influence of the PS corona.",

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

            "text": "One of the main routes for administration of NBMs for cancer theranostics is the intravenous (i.v.) via, which poses major challenges in the development of new nanosystems. Once injected, NBMs will interact with a complex mixture of biomolecules naturally present in the bloodstream that can bind on their surface generating a biomolecular corona, which can confer a new biological identity to the NPs, inducing what is called the \"corona effect\". This is a major concern since the characteristics of the outermost molecular layer are always responsible for the interaction of such \"modified NBMs\", thus influencing the way they will interact with the biological system, such as the vessel walls, tissues, and organs. Accordingly, the formation of a biomolecular corona can completely change the biological parameters, such as the pharmacokinetics and fate of nanoparticles, now strongly influenced by the biomolecules that are adsorbed on the NPs surface (Corbo et al., 2015). Furthermore, the corona layer can interfere in the biological activity as illustrated by Salvati et al. The group demonstrated that transferrin-conjugated NPs, a glycoprotein known to target transferrin receptors overexpressed in some cancer cell subtypes, can lose the vectoring ability upon adsorption of biomolecules (Salvati et al., 2013). \n\nThe corona layer consists of two parts, the hard corona and the soft corona (Figure 3). The former one is comprised of molecules that are strongly bound to the NPs surface and have a slow exchange rate, while the latter one is constituted by more weakly and dynamically attached biomolecules (Corbo et al., 2015). Ashby et al. showed that the nature of the IO NPs coating layer influences the bonding/dissociation dynamic of the corona. A soft corona is preferentially formed when the hydrophobicity of the NPs surface is increased since proteins with faster exchange rates tend to be adsorbed (Ashby et al., 2014). Furthermore, the corona composition can change the cellular uptake mechanism as demonstrated by Francia et al. in vitro incubating nanoparticles with different amounts of human serum.",

            "text": "Fifteen years have elapsed since the term \"protein corona\" was introduced by Dawson, Linse, and their colleagues [1]. While the adsorption of proteins onto surfaces, such as particles, scaffolds, or implants, has been recognized for quite some time, its true significance in bio-nano research had not been thoroughly examined until the publication of the report. The concept of the protein corona can be likened to the halo of plasma surrounding the sun, where proteins in a solution containing serum form a coating around tiny particles. This analogy draws a parallel between the glowing halo surrounding the sun and the protein coats enveloping particles in serum-containing environments [2]. Recent discoveries have revealed that the formation of a protein corona is driven by thermodynamic reactions in water-based environments, with the goal of minimizing free enthalpy. The process is influenced by underlying physics. Throughout history, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding the nature and properties of protein coronas, employing a diverse range of models and methods from the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences [3]. The exploration of protein coronas holds tremendous potential for diverse biomedical and nanotechnological applications, as it profoundly influences the behavior and interactions of nanoparticles within biological systems. By delving deeper into the complexities of protein corona formation, we can pave the way for more effective and targeted applications in medicine and beyond. In the biomedical domain, nanotechnology plays a crucial role in the development of materials for screening, smart delivery, and medication administration, driving extensive research in this area. When a nanoparticle is introduced into a complex biomedium, it undergoes the Vroman effect, where it initially acquires a temporary or \"soft\" corona composed of large-sized molecules that are present in high concentrations. Subsequently, the nanoparticle becomes enveloped in a \"hard\" corona, formed by molecules with a stronger affinity [4]. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon conceptually [5]. During protein binding, the enthalpy is lowered, and the nanoparticle's coat undergoes changes, increasing entropy. These interactions have diverse outcomes, including enhanced bioavailability and dispersion of particles in serumcontaining media.",

            "text": "They found that the protein corona increased the binding affinity of the NPs to bind to the Zika virus NS1 [84]. In contrast, Dai et al. examined the effect of protein corona formation on the targeting ability of silicapoly(methacrylic acid)-PEG-AntiHER2 NPs. They demonstrated that a protein corona from human serum affects the NPs surface properties by reducing surface charge and availability of conjugated molecules on the NPs, which results in a reduction of targeting capacity from 70% to 7%. However, HAS-incubated NPs exhibited increased interaction between targeting molecule and ligand, boosting the targeting capacity of Afb-conjugated NPs, which further confirmed the multicomponent effect of the protein corona [85]. Based on these findings, it appears that the protein corona significantly alters the properties of the antibody-conjugated NPs in both affirmative and destructive manners. \n\nThe protein corona formation results in the reduction or elimination of NP targeting capability by shielding or completely covering relevant functional groups. To block the adhesion of corona proteins on NP surfaces, various strategies have been established using surface barrier layers, such as polymer, protein, or biomimetic coatings, with the ultimate aim to prolong the blood circulation time of NPs. However, some of these strategies inhibit the internalization of NPs by cancer cells, resulting in limited therapeutic effectiveness. Accumulating evidence suggests that protein-repellent coating compounds (zwitterionic compounds) on NP surfaces prevent or minimize the corona formation. Precoating of NPs with specific proteins that increase the adsorption of plasma proteins with intrinsic targeting capacities also improve the targeting ability of the NPs. Moreover, researchers demonstrated that attachment of targeting moieties on the surface of corona-coated NPs increases the targeting capacity. These strategies are useful to shield the effect of protein corona formation and, therefore, improve the biodistribution profile and targeting efficacies of the NPs [86].",

With dynamic light scattering, it is possible to directly monitor the aggregation state of nanocarriers in concentrated blood plasma. 69,70  his method is suitable for screening the behavior of nanocarriers in blood plasma prior to in vivo investigations. The SiO 2 NCs stabilized by cationic surfactant CTMA-Cl formed macroscopic aggregates in concentrated plasma. However, aggregation formation was significantly reduced after PEGylation of the NCs with the PEGbased nonionic surfactant Lutensol AT50 (Figure 6). Surface charge of the NCs was reduced from +12 mV to ~ 0 mV due to the removal of cationic surfactant (Figure 2). With increased density of PEG chains on the surface, the SiO 2 NCs became more stable in PBS and in blood plasma (Figure S3). Especially, going from 0.64 to 0.96 PEG chains / nm\u00b2 resulted in a major stability improvement, suggesting a certain threshold of required surface PEG density. While some aggregates of SiO 2 NCs in blood plasma could still be observed after PEGylation, the intensity contribution factor of these larger species suggest that their actual concentration is very low compared to stable NCs (Figure S3b). The exemplary autocorrelation functions of the corresponding measured samples are given in Figure S4.

Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB.

            "text": "While the above approaches allow to more accurately identify which corona components play a role in nanoparticle uptake, the next important aspect to unravel is which cell receptors are involved (Figure 2C). Thus, following the identification of all possible interacting receptors based on corona composition and/or epitope mapping, it is important to verify which of them can actually recognize and bind to the corona and if such recognition and the interaction with those receptors also lead to nanoparticle internalization. For instance, Caracciolo et al. (2013) showed that abundant adsorption of vitronectin from human plasma on lipid nanoparticles promoted nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells overexpressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the uptake. Epitope mapping can also be used to predict the involvement of certain receptors. In the study by Lara et al. (2017) discussed above, epitope mapping showed exposure of apolipoprotein B-100 and the Fc region of IgG in the biomolecular corona of 100 nm silica (Figures 4A,B). Then, the authors also showed that in cells overexpressing their receptors, i.e., the LDL receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively, nanoparticle uptake was enhanced (see Figures 4C,D for LDL receptor), while adding LDL reduced it (Figure 4E). These results suggested that nanoparticle uptake was mediated by recognition of the biomolecular corona by these specific receptors. These studies also showed that the biomolecular corona can be recognized by multiple receptors in the same cells. Interactions with multiple receptors may lead to uptake via multiple pathways. In line with this, Francia et al. (2019) showed that 50 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles coated with a different corona (in low or high amounts of human serum) interacted with different receptors and consecutively were internalized by cells using different pathways. Thus, the interaction of the corona with specific cell receptors can also affect the mechanisms cells use for nanoparticle internalization. \n\nGiven the wide variety of proteins constituting the biomolecular corona, it has also emerged that more complex motifs can be formed in this layer.",

            "text": "PEGylation is for example a popular way to reduce protein adsorption to nanoparticles. [80] It works by preventing (reducing) the direct contact between protein and (nanoparticle or macroscopic) surface by introducing an additional hydrophilic polymer layer. Due to the curvature of the nanoparticles the molecular weight and density of the PEG coating is hereby of extreme importance (for larger particles an effective shielding is thereby easier to achieve due to the reduced surface curvature). [81] More recently, zwitterionic surfaces, which get highly hydrated, [82,83] have also been suggested as protein repellant coating. [84,85] In fact, nanoparticles with zwitterionic surfaces have been reported, for which an absence of corona formation is observed within the limits of accuracy. [71] Alternatively on can describe such cases, that the apparent K D value of this protein nanoparticle surface interaction lies about the experimentally accessible protein concentration. [85] n this case, it is assumed that approaching proteins interactnearly exclusively-with the hydrated water layer on the surface and (nearly) not with the underlying zwitterionic material. \n\nTherefore, protein corona formation -and its magnitude-depends on the structure of the nanoparticle surface in contact with the proteins (see Figure 1 and Table 1). [86] Interestingly, especially nanoparticles based on hydrophobic materials, such as carbon, latex, or polystyrene based nanoparticles, tend to form a protein corona, likely due to imperfect surface shielding/coverage. \n\nIt is in this context-important to remember that although protein corona formation on nanoparticles happens on the nanoscale and on particles with high surface curvature, it is based on the same physicochemical effects, that govern protein Table 1. Protein corona formation on different nanoparticles (NP) like colloids, polymeric micelles (and comparable structures), liposomes, and nanogels (see Figure 1a).",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "When nanomaterials are exposed to a biological environment, e.g. blood, serum, cytoplasm etc., constituents thereof inevitably adsorb to their surface. 1,2 The formed adlayer is commonly referred to as a biomolecule corona (biocorona). 3 5][6] Thus, the biological activity, e.g. cellular response and toxicity, of a nanomaterial is dependent on the environment that the material is/has been exposed to. 7,8 For this reason, it is important to not only characterize nanomaterials as synthesized (synthetic identity) but also in situ when introduced in a biological environment (biological identity). \n\n0][11] Proteins with high concentration will likely bind first but with time be replaced by proteins with high affinity for the surface. 12 The on/off rates and the concentration of each biomolecule will determine the contents in the corona over time until equilibrium is reached. For example, there are a number of studies describing the multiple protein binding to silica nanoparticles in complex protein mixtures, 5,10,11,[13][14][15] whereas another recent study reports that in human blood plasma a single protein is dominating when the particle surface area is scarce. 11 An alternative view of the formation of the corona is that biomolecules stochastically adsorb irreversibly to the nanoparticle surface. 16 It is likely that the nature of the nanoparticle surface determines which process dominates and that on some surfaces a combination of different processes occurs. However, very little is known about correlations between simultaneously occurring molecular adsorption processes and specific nanoparticle descriptors such as size and shape because real time corona formation studies are experimentally very difficult. \n\nCommonly, when the corona formed in blood serum or plasma is studied, nanomaterials (often in the form of particles) are incubated in biological media. The formed complexes of the nanomaterial with adsorbed proteins, lipids or other biomolecules, are separated from unbound biomolecules (e.g. by centrifugation), and characterized (e.g. by mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis).",

On th hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the n particle physicochemical properties. It changes the size, shape, and even the aggreg state of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects how proteins are oriented and present the biological targets [17]. On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may tr protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein func and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune resp to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface Upon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad ological processes. The formation of the protein corona creates a different structure will drive and influence the behavior and interaction of the nanoparticles with biolo systems. Thus, the protein corona can alter the interactions of the nanoparticle wit cell surface moieties (e.g., antibodies), promoting or inhibiting the uptake of the nan ticle by the cell [18]. For instance, in a case of study with silica nanoparticle, it wa Nanomaterial interactions with proteins can be controlled by different strategies, nanoparticle surface functionalization being the most common one [15]. This is because protein corona formation is a process commonly considered problematic, and thus great effort is being invested by the scientific community on designing and engineering coatings that minimize protein adsorption on nanomaterial surfaces as much as possible [16].",

NPs display distinctive features in the human body, but there is only a limited knowledge of how these NPs interact with cells and biomolecules such as proteins.Depending on the NP dimension, pH of the medium, surface chemistry and type of NPs and proteins, proteins can mediate the formation of a corona at the external surface of NPs [16][17][18].The unique protein coronas of differently modified or differently sized NPs affect all features of NP -biological systems interactions ranging from induced cytotoxicity to the mechanism of infiltration [19][20][21][22][23]. NPs after uptaking by a physiological environment are coated with biomolecules almost spontaneously [24,25].The long-lived protein or short-lived protein layers adsorbed tightly or weakly on the NP surface are considered as the hardest coronas (HC) or softest coronas (SC), respectively [26,27].Hard protein corona compounds allocate the biological identity of the NPs and coronas trigger NP bioactivities such as membrane adhesion, infiltration mechanism, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution, and protection [28][29][30][31].Not only the surface features and dimension of NPs and pH of the medium mediate their behavior in vivo, but also the type of proteins attached on the NP [32].",

            "text": "Understanding the fundamental interactions of plasma proteins with nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and gold nanoparticles is critical in the evaluation of the inflammatory and blood coagulation process of these materials for potential drug-delivery applications. [1][2][3] The use of nanoparticles as carriers for biomolecules has been widely studied, 4 the bioavailability of nanoparticles dependent on the cellular uptake and effective biodistribution of nanoparticles throughout the body for controlled drug delivery. 5,6 It has been widely accepted that nanometer-scale surface topography and chemistry greatly contribute to the protein adsorption on nanoparticles. For example, recent studies have emphasized the importance of the conformational state of an adhered protein, as the activity of a protein is contingent on its structural conformation. 7 In accordance with this point of view, it was hypothesized that the interaction between nanoparticles and plasma proteins can determine the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles. 8,9 The assembly of proteins surrounding nanoparticles is governed by hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interactions at the surface of the nanoparticles. 10,11 Although the protein corona forms soon after the exposure of the surface of nanoparticles to blood plasma, 12 the intrinsic surface properties of nanoparticles instantly induce conformational changes in blood proteins, and in turn modulate nanoparticle toxicity on cells. 3 Fibrinogen, a well-known regulator of the host inflammatory response, triggers hemostasis and leukocyte activation through stimulation of the integrin receptor, Mac-1. 13 While the molecular mechanism behind leukocyte activation remains unclear and controversial, the structural state of fibrinogen is believed to play an important role in high affinity binding with Mac-1. Notably, immobilized fibrinogen acts as a better ligand than soluble fibrinogen for Mac-1, suggesting that the conformational state of fibrinogen is critical to leukocyte activation. In this regard, the effect of nanoparticles on the conformational change of fibrinogen may provide a molecular level understanding of the inflammatory response to nanoparticles",

            "text": "PC can change significantly the behavior of NPs in vivo, therefore its control has been extensively studied to facilitate applications of NPs in nanomedicine. One of the main strategies to reduce the formation of the corona has featured the functionalization of particles with hydrophilic ligands and coatings (Amoozgar & Yeo, 2012;Ke et al., 2017;Rampado et al., 2020). Functionalization with hydrophilic motifs promotes the formation of hydration shells, thus making the NP surface less available for interactions with proteins and other biomolecules. Among the potential ligands, PEG is certainly the most well-known and used surface motif. Although PEG chains reduce NP-protein interactions thanks to their hydrophilic character, other properties such as polymer chain length and density on the particle surface have also been found to play an important role. The effect of coating poly(lactic acid) (PLA) NPs with PEG ligands ranging from 2 to 20 kDa on PC formation was reported over two decades ago (Gref et al., 2000). A strong decrease in protein adsorption was initially observed when particles were functionalized with PEG ranging between 2 and 5 kDa. Only a small reduction was then seen for PEG chains longer than 5 kDa, suggesting that the optimum NP coverage had been reached at 5 kDa. In a different study, polymeric micelles coated with PEG ligands and incubated in whole human blood showed a progressive inhibition of PC formation when PEG size increased from 5 to 20 kDa, indicating that the increase in molecular weight of the PEG chains results in a decrease in the formation of PC (Miteva et al., 2015). Interestingly, the two studies also indicate that for different particles systems, the optimal length of the PEG chains might have to be tailored. Nevertheless, coating of NPs with PEG does not always reduce the PC formation efficiently. As described by Seneca et al., the amount of proteins adsorbed on PEGylated NPs varied significantly depending on the density of the PEG chains present on the surface (Seneca et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Is it non-cellular molecular recruitment or immune cell recognition that occurs first when a pathogen enters the bloodstream? In analogy to artificial nanoparticles, we have postulated that pathogens acquire a biocorona as they invade, circulate, and reside in the host. It is plausible that this biocorona depends on the point of entry of the pathogen, i.e., depending on whether the pathogen invades the host through the blood, airways, or gastrointestinal system, which will affect the biomolecular composition of the acquired corona [108][109][110]. Focusing on the non-cellular blood interactome as a major source of the biocorona components, the order and rate at which these components are adsorbed onto the pathogen surface warrants investigation. With silica nanoparticles in human plasma [17], protein adsorption is detected in a few seconds; it is conceivable that a similarly fast rate of adsorption will be observed with pathogens. The development of the innate immune response is also rapid, typically within minutes to hours [111]. We think that the noncellular blood interactome should be viewed as an innate immune response that can impact the biological actions of pathogens and non-pathogenic invading entities (e.g., vaccine constructs) alike. What is the spatial architecture of the pathogen-attracted biomolecular corona? Future research may reveal whether distinct layers of biomolecules interact with the inherited pathogen biocorona, as it has been postulated that artificial nanoparticles may be covered by a (soft) protein corona located on top of an inner (hard) protein corona directly bound to the nanoparticle surface [32]. We postulated that the pathogen-protein interaction is established rapidly, possibly in a few seconds, as proposed by Tenzer et al. for artificial nanoparticle-protein interactions, and that the resulting pathogen interactome does not change in composition, but only in the quantity of proteins taken up over time [27]. Those are areas warranting research as the proteins on the corona are susceptible to posttranslational modifications, including the binding of lipids and carbohydrates.\n\nThe non-cellular blood interactome is likely to be host-specific and capable of",

By tuning the material properties of the nanoparticles a number of different biological applications of nanomaterials are enabled i.e. targeting, labelling, drug delivery, use as diagnostic tools or therapy. For all biological applications of nanoparticles, it is important to understand their interactions with the surrounding biological environment in order to predict their biological impact, in particular when designing the nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, the surface of nanomaterials is very reactive. When exposed to biological fluids, the proteins and biomolecules present therein tend to associate with the nanoparticles' surface. This phenomenon is defined as biomolecular corona formation. The biomolecular corona plays a key role in the interaction between nanoparticles and biological systems, impacting on how these particles interact with biological systems on a cellular and molecular level. This book chapter describes the nature of the interactions at the bio-nano interface, shows the design strategy of nanoparticles for nanomedicine, and defines the concepts of biomolecular corona and biological identity of nanoparticles. Moreover, it describes the interaction of functionalised nanomaterials with cell organelles and intracellular fate of nanoparticles and it shows therapeutic application of gold nanoparticles as dose enhancers in radiotherapy.",

Concerning the interactions between nanoparticles and blood components, an interesting study reports the QCM-D characterization of the interactions between a lipid bilayer and carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles coated with different kinds of protein corona [20]. The study found that the 'soft' protein corona, composed of loosely bounded proteins, induced a permanent alteration in the lipid bilayer structure, while the 'hard' protein corona, composed of strongly bounded proteins, weakly interacted with a lipid bilayer. However, QCM-D is a very versatile technique with which the interactions of nanoparticles have also been studied with other blood components, such as platelets [21] The study of the protein corona is crucial for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles. The QCM-D technique can provide reliable screening of interactions with protein corona-related blood proteins and has been used in several studies to characterize protein corona formation on polymeric nanoparticles. However, the results obtained from QCM-D measurements should be interpreted in the whole context of the specific system under investigation, and other techniques should be used in conjunction with QCM-D to provide a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. \n\nIn the present work, the QCM-D technique is applied to a rough evaluation of the protein corona formation around poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles. The QCM-D sensors were functionalized with three different blood proteins, namely albumin from human serum (HSA), fibrinogen type I from human plasma (HPF), and \u03b3-globulins from human blood (HBG), and the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the functionalization layers was evaluated. Three nanoparticles with different protein affinities were tested, and the system was validated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis experiments. This research provides a valid method to characterize the interactions between tested nanoparticles and three blood proteins commonly abundant in the protein corona.",

            "text": "Extensive information about the behavioral and physicochemical properties of NMs that are engineered in technically stable environments, such as technical products, is needed to understand their changes in complex physiological or natural environments. 1 Due to a high surface:volume ratio, NPs are quite likely to interact with (bio)molecules upon contact with biological and abiotic environments. This interaction leads to the formation of the so-called (bio) molecular corona. This (bio)molecular corona is formed spontaneously like an adsorption layer on the NP surface in complex biological environments, including simple and higher organisms. The interaction of NPs with organisms and control of their physiological responses are mediated by the adsorption layer, rather than the NP surface. Also, biomolecular adsorption can be affected by different properties of NPs, including shape, size, composition, surface charge, and surface functionalization. [44][45][46][47] Protein absorption to NP surfaces was postulated in the pioneering work by Vroman, and thus is known as the \"Vroman effect\". 48 This effect describes a dynamic change in protein-corona composition by adsorption and desorption. Consequently, in a complex biofluid like blood, which contains thousands of different proteins, abundant proteins are expected to desorb from the NP surface and be replaced by rare ones with higher affinity, leading to a relatively constant level of adsorbed proteins. 47,49,50 The term \"protein corona\" was introduced to the NP community in 2007 by Cedervall et al. 49 Subsequently, the loosely defined term \"hard protein corona\" was described as a strongly bound layer of biomolecules, representing an analytically approachable protein/biomolecule signature of NPs in a determined environment. 1,44,50 Some models further indicate the presence of a \"soft protein corona\" around the \"hard protein corona\", consisting of loosely associated, rapidly exchanging, and highly complex biomolecule layers without direct contact with the NPs. 1,44,49,51,52 Nevertheless, since it is determined that this \"soft protein corona\" (also called \"soft corona cloud\") desorbs during purification processes, its presence, analytical dissection, and important effects at the nano-bio interface are fully affirmed.

            "text": "In some cases, a protein corona can form around the nanostructure through non-covalent interactions with serum proteins (Figure 1A-3) [44,45]. Depending on its composition and distribution, the protein corona can have beneficial or adverse effects on RN functionality [46], which sparked significant efforts dedicated to understanding protein corona formation around NPs. These include studies focusing on the effects of the corona on the NP's physicochemical properties and activity through incubation with blood plasma [47], but also proteomic profiling approaches focusing on the effects NP properties have on corona protein adsorption [48]. The protein corona mediates adverse effects including shielding of targeting moieties displayed by RNs [46], causing inefficient binding and potential off-target accumulation, and tagging the nanostructure with immunoglobulins and complement proteins (opsonins) [49] to target the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), which rapidly sequesters them from the blood, reducing their bioavailability and activity [50,51]. On the other side, the beneficial effects include adsorption to dysopsonins, such as serum albumin and clusterin, resulting in increased circulation time of smaller RNs and improved targeting ability, stealth, and safety profile for in vivo applications [50,52,53]. This adsorption can also be achieved through the introduction of a hydrophobic group like palmitoyl in the RNA scaffold which can stably bind albumin and lipoproteins [54,55]. An alternative strategy successfully applied to different types of NPs [45], is precoating or functionalizing the RNs with proteins such as albumin to potentially improve pharmacokinetics [56], as well as targeting, and internalization. \n\nThe increase in size due to the protein corona coating the surface of the RN could also influence its biodistribution, bioavailability, and clearance leading to high accumulation in organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys [13] (Figure 1A-4).",

            "text": "Moreover, bio-coronas can enhance the effectiveness of NPs used as drug delivery vehicles by increasing their payload capacity (Hamad-Schifferli 2015). Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

            "text": "Selection of an appropriate surface coating may increase the biocompatibility of QDs in physiological conditions. For example, polymer coatings, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been reported to successfully passivate the surface and increase the chemical stability of QDs, reducing their degradation (Wang et al., 2013). \n\nAnother important aspect to consider, when working with nanoparticles in complex environments, is the nonspecific interaction with proteins. Biological fluids contain a variety of proteins, which may adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles and create a layer called the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Motevalian et al., 2020;Nakatsuka et al., 2018c;Perng et al., 2019;Salvati et al., 2013;Song et al., 2020). Such protein coronas may trigger the aggregation of the nanoparticles, which consequently impairs their functionality and/or significantly reduces their retention time in blood (Salvati et al., 2013). The chemical nature of the surface coating of nanoparticles have been reported as key factors in the formation of the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Perng et al., 2019). For instance, while PEG coatings in general reduce the protein adsorption on QDs, amine-terminated PEG still induces protein corona formation, while carboxyl-decorated PEG significantly reduces protein adsorption (Perng et al., 2019). \n\nHowever, in some cases, protein corona formation may have beneficial effects on the properties of QDs (Frutiger et al., 2021). For example, the protein corona on thioglycolic acid-coated CdTe QDs increased their fluorescence by inducing the rearrangement of the surface coating and subsequently reducing surface defects (Motevalian et al., 2020). In addition, carefully regulated protein coronas has been harnessed to cloak nanoparticles from rapid clearance by the immune system for targeted drug delivery (Rampado et al., 2020;Oh et al., 2018). Further, human serum albumin protein corona formation has been shown to mitigate the toxicity of carbon QDs (Song et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Moreover, bio-coronas can enhance the effectiveness of NPs used as drug delivery vehicles by increasing their payload capacity (Hamad-Schifferli 2015). Sanchez-Moreno et al. (2015) studied in detail how the NP uptake and the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are affected by adding a poloxamer in order to control corona formation. Four-lipid core-shell nanosystem with a hydrophobic core constituted by olive oil and hydrophilic shell by different composition (Pluronic F127 and Epikuron 145 V) was reported. The nature and the concentration of the surfactant can control the interactions between lipid NPs and the biological environment. The blood circulation time of the NPs could be increased by adding a coating, like poloxomer, which leads to a lower uptake by macrophage through reducing unspecific binding, but this likewise attenuated the uptake into the target cells and decreased therapeutic efficacy (Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2015). In order to increase the recognition and uptake at the target sites, targeting moieties could be conjugated on these NPs (Rata-Aguilar et al. 2012;Sanchez-Moreno et al. 2013). \n\nInteractions with serum proteins endow NPs with the best bio-corona for nanomedicine applications (Lynch and Dawson 2008;Mahmoudi et al. 2011a, b). Yallapu et al. 1 3 (2015) showed that different adsorption patterns dictate the intended target. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) binding to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) led to enhanced transport across the blood-brain barrier. Protein binding to a lesser extent resulted in NPs targeting blood circulation, while an increased binding guided NPs toward liver and kidney. The same authors demonstrated that after the protein corona formation, MNPs undergo an uptake process that has an increased dynamics or an increased interaction with the membrane structures, enhancing the overall internalization process in cancer cell lines (Yallapu et al. 2015). \n\nHuman serum albumin and apoE are used to steadily form conjugates with polyelectrolyte multilayer-coated gold NP (AuNP) prior to intravenous injection.",

Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro [49,65] and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly [49,51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets [66], the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities. In addition to biological lipid-based nanoparticles in blood, cell membranes can also function as a lipid sink.\n\n3.2.1.1. PEG-lipids mediate indirect targeting capabilities of LNPs. In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles",

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

            "text": "As we discussed previously, when the nanoparticle enters the bloodstream it encounters hydrodynamic forces and a corona of bloodstream proteins forms on its surface; a subset of these proteins form the highly specific complement activation reaction that leads to removal by macrophages. Regarding behavior in the bloodstream and the effect of size and shape (Shah et al., 2011), the most suitable method is not MD, but rather a combination of theoretical calculation (Decuzzi et al., 2005) and a discretized continuum model known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), described and used to model this by Li et al. (2014b), Gupta (2016), and Gao et al. (2020) to model nanoparticle transport in the faulty tumor vasculature (Gao et al.). As we have mentioned, the formation of the protein corona is an extremely complex process that still remains poorly understood. What is clear, however, is that the surface properties of the nanoparticle affect this and the mechanism through which the protective polymer corona increases the bloodstream lifetime is modulation of the interaction with bloodstream proteins. Schafer et al. (2017) and Settanni et al. (2017aSettanni et al. ( ,b, 2018 combined experimental analysis with MD to study the interaction between two protective polymers, PEG and poly-sarcosine, with a set of proteins found in the bloodstream. They found evidence that the interactions are not amino acid specific but rather a general tendency dependent on the charge and polarity of the amino acid and the nature of the interaction between the polymer and water, in addition to the direct polymer-protein interaction. Their methodology, synergistically combined with experimental work, could provide a route to a rational design approach to the development of new polymer materials being developed that may have superior performance as a protective polymer corona. Lee et al. used the coarse grained MARTINI model to directly simulate the effect of PEGylation and PEGylation density on the interaction between the liposome and blood stream proteins; Lee also used MD simulation with atomistic resolution to study the effect of nanoparticle electrostatics in protein corona formation (Lee, 2020a). There are other examples of the use of MD modeling to study the protein corona of nanoparticles (",

            "text": "Corona. Different physicochemical properties, not only size, may determine the ability of nanoparticles to reach the brain. The situation is further complicated by the formation of a so-called \"corona\" of biomolecules on the surfaces of nanoparticles, the composition of which may vary depending on the route of exposure, and on the physicochemical surface properties of NPs. The acquisition of a corona of biomolecules on the surface of NPs may also determine whether NPs are able to cross from one compartment to another and whether they are taken up effectively by cells or not [156]. \n\nIn practical situations in which nanoparticles interact with living organisms, the nanoparticle surfaces are initially exposed to a biological fluid, such as blood, depending on the route of administration. For instance, NPs injected intravenously would be exposed to blood plasma, containing an excess of proteins and many other complex biomolecules, which bind competitively with the surface of the nanoparticles. \n\nThe current idea is that \"bare\" nanoparticles do not exist in vivo, because they are immediately modified by the adsorption of blood proteins with higher affinities for the particle surface, forming a more or less tightly bound layer (the so-called hard corona) and a weakly associated mobile layer (the so-called soft corona). When this issue was investigated, it has been found that typical coronas contain a limited number and types of molecules gathered from the blood, in spite of the fact that biological fluids contain thousands of proteins [157]. Moreover, it should be noted that the corona may also play a role in other undesirable effects of NPs in living systems such as complement activation and blood clotting and may not necessarily play a role only in cellular uptake. \n\nIt should be pointed out that none of the in vitro experiments conducted to study the process of NPs translocation to the brain takes into account the surface modification of NPs inside the blood and how can this affect the crossing of the BBB. This issue needs much further investigation.",

Expanding the circulation time of the nanoparticles means more contact with the blood proteins, a higher probability of thrombogenicity, and the activation of the complement system [92]. Since the corona depends on the characteristics of the nanoparticle (chemical surface, size, shape, and charge), these properties could be adjusted in such a way for the proteins that make it up to mitigate the immune response. Tuning the properties of affinity toward the corona could optimize the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles and reduce their toxicity. However, this process is not easy, and few researchers designing nanomaterials take corona formation into consideration. Ideally, nanoparticle development should encompass studies that provide data regarding nanoparticle-protein interactions, as is customary during the development of a new drug. There are few reports on this subject, and limited knowledge in this field may be a reason for the lack of successful clinical treatments.",

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles are surprising materials, in particular for their plasmonic properties which occur when they interact with light [1][2][3][4]. These properties are related to their nanoscale structure, depending on their shape, size, coating agent and assembly [5][6][7][8][9][10]. This implies that through an appropriate synthetic strategy, it is possible to obtain nanoparticles whose plasmonic properties adapt to the fields of application, which include, in biomedical, imaging, drug delivery, hyper-thermal and photothermal therapies [11][12][13]. While much remains to be understood about how nanoparticles interact with individual biological systems, it is generally believed that when nanoparticles come into contact with a biological medium, such as serum, the biomolecules within, mainly simple proteins and lipids, will adsorb on their surface. \n\nSerum proteins to a large extent include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), fibrinogen and apolipoproteins [14][15][16][17]. The proteins that adsorb on the surface of the metal, based on their affinity with that surface, are divided into two classes: the ''hard'' corona proteins, that is tightly bound proteins, and the ''soft'' corona proteins, that is low-binding proteins. Among the various hypotheses formulated in the literature, the ''hard'' corona proteins interact directly with the metal surface, while the ''soft'' ones interact with the hard corona, and exploit the protein-protein interactions [18,19]. However, the chemical surface of the nanoparticles plays a key role in the formation of the protein corona; a stabilizing nanoparticle coating such as thiolate polyethylene glycol covalently bonded to the gold surface affects the formation of the protein corona. On the other hand, a citrate coating, which uses a negative electrostatic interaction to bind the metal surface, is easily replaceable and allows for spontaneous adsorption of proteins [20][21][22][23][24].",

            "text": "Thus, the formation of protein corona and its impacts are considered one of the keystones to the gap between in vitro design and in vivo therapeutic effect. \n\nThus, there is a pressing need for the understanding of protein-NPs interactions to control the formation of protein corona. Several articles have suggested that the protein-NPs interactions are associated with the physicochemical properties of the NPs and the media 19,20 . To control the formation of protein corona, the directional modification of the physicochemical properties of the NPs is an effective strategy. The modifications of surface charge, hydrophobicity and morphology of NPs are complicated and costly, which makes the NPs even harder for industrialization 21 . Compared to other properties of NPs, the control of NPs size is the most mature and commonly used methods during NPs designing. Besides, the medium pH of the lesion varies with the disease type and condition. Hence, the medium pH is considered one of the key factors during the protein corona formation of NPs. \n\nA series of articles have been reported to illustrate the effect of particle size or media pH on protein corona formation in gold NPs 22e24 , silica NPs 25,26 and polymeric NPs 27 . It was suggested that the amount and types of adsorption protein were significantly affected by these factors. However, the systemic studies about the interaction between solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and protein are still missing. The conclusions or experiences obtained from the previous studies are not sufficient for comprehensive understanding the protein corona formation of SLNs. Unlike inorganic NPs, SLNs is a lipid-based nanocarrier which bears a core-shell structure: a hydrophilic surfactant shell and a hydrophobic lipid core. In the past decades, SLNs was widely employed in the treatment of colon cancer 28 , cystic fibrosis 29 , bacterial infection 30 , sepsis 31 , etc., and great therapeutic effects were shown in these studies. Compared to metal or polymeric NPs, the clinical transformation of SLNs is also more promising for its simple and low-cost production process, high biocompatibility and excellent drug loading capacity. When the administrated SLNs absorbed into plasma and most human organs, they are exposed to near-neutral pH environment.",

            "text": "Proteins constitute the majority of bonded biomolecules on the outer layer of nanoparticles in a serum-containing medium, but recently, traces of lipids have also been discovered [84]. Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between the soft and hard coronas. Even at the minimum concentration of biomolecules, the corona layer provides total surface coverage. By contrast, the adsorbed corona does not entirely obscure the outer layer of nanoparticles [82]. \n\nThe thickness of the protein corona can be influenced by several factors, including protein content, particle size, and particle surface characteristics. Proteins in plasma have hydrodynamic sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nm, and the formed protein layer is extremely thick, comprising multiple layers of linked proteins rather than just one. Simberg et al. introduced the concept of the protein corona [85]. According to this concept, the protein corona contains \"primary binders\" that directly recognize the outer layer of nanoparticles and \"secondary binders\" that interact with the primary binders through protein-protein interactions. The secondary binders may modify the activity of the primary binders or \"cover\" them, thus inhibiting their contact, which is crucial for the physiological response [86]. \n\nWalkey and Chan reviewed a group of plasma proteins called adsorbomes that are commonly found in the protein coronas of nanomaterials [87]. This list is expected to grow in the future with increasing research on the topic. Based on nearly 20 years of research, a \"normal\" plasma protein corona consists of approximately 2-6 proteins that are bound abundantly, along with numerous additional proteins that are bound with lower abundances.",

For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

            "text": "that the three nanoparticles investigated in this study circulate very well in vivo in mice. Prolonged circulation times are of major importance, since they enhance the chance for passive or active targeting and thus for accumulation in the tumor tissue. This could be verified for similar or identical structures of the tested nanoparticles (see section \"Tumor accumulation of studied nanoparticles\" in the Supporting Information). In addition and more important, the PEG NPs (CPC634) show excellent pharmacokinetics in patients. [52] Hereafter, we considered a comparative study of the interaction of the three nanoparticles with plasma proteins important to gain a better understanding of the role of protein affinity and protein corona formation on the circulation times.\n\nTo determine interactions with plasma proteins, the three nanoparticles were incubated in EDTA-stabilized, full human plasma (pooled from six healthy donors) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and continuously agitated (500 rpm) to simulate the conditions in the body, where diffusion of cells and proteins constantly occur in the blood flow. As previously shown, one hour of incubation is sufficient for protein corona formation. [53,54] Since the separation of nanoparticles and plasma components by centrifugation is hardly possible for systems with densities comparable to plasma, such as polymeric micelles, we have chosen to apply asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation for the separation of nanoparticles and plasma components. Here, we specifically optimized AF4 separation conditions for each nanoparticle allowing the exclusive elution of the incubated nanoparticles and their separation from the plasma proteins. The isolated nanoparticle-protein-complex was then measured by dynamic light scattering to characterize any size increase due to protein adsorption. Moreover, protein affinity was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and label-free liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A schematic illustration of the separation procedure is displayed in Figure 2.\n\nSince most single proteins in blood plasma are in the size range of 6-10 nm, [55] thus smaller than the investigated nanopar",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

Their sizes, structures, and chemical properties allow for the exploration of a vast range of potential applications and novel approaches in basic research. Biomedical applications, such as drug or gene delivery, often require the release of nanoparticles into the bloodstream, which is populated by blood cells and a plethora of small peptides, proteins, sugars, lipids, and complexes of all these molecules. Generally, in biological fluids, a nanoparticle\u2019s surface is covered by different biomolecules, which regulate the interactions of nanoparticles with tissues and, eventually, their fate. The adsorption of molecules onto the nanomaterial is described as \u201ccorona\u201d formation. Every blood particulate component can contribute to the creation of the corona, although small proteins represent the majority of the adsorbed chemical moieties. The precise rules of surface-protein adsorption remain unknown, although the surface charge and topography of the nanoparticle seem to discriminate the different coronas. We will describe examples of adsorption of specific biomolecules onto nanoparticles as one of the methods for natural surface functionalization, and highlight advantages and limitations. Our critical review of these topics may help to design appropriate nanomaterials for specific drug delivery.",

            "text": "For a deeper understanding of protein corona formation under physiological conditions it is essential to identify the underlying individual factors governing the corona under these conditions. In 2011, Tenzer and colleagues discovered that the size of the particles alone is a critical physicochemical determinant of the human blood plasma corona [8]. They could show that even differences in silica nanoparticle (SiNP) size of only 10 nm significantly affected the protein corona composition around three different SiNPs (with diameters of about 20, 30, and 110 nm). One strategy to interpret their results was to classify the SiNP-specific protein signatures, as identified by quantitative mass spectrometry, by their calculated isoelectric point (Figure 5). \n\nAt the physiological pH of blood plasma (pH 7.3), preferential binding of negatively charged proteins (pI < 7) onto the SiNP surfaces was reported. The protein size also played a significant role: While proteins with a high molecular mass were enriched on the NP surfaces as compared to their abundance in the plasma, proteins with low molecular mass were less abundant in the corona than in the surrounding plasma (Figure 5c,d). \n\nOf all identified corona proteins 37% showed significant differences in their binding behavior towards the NP surface as the NP size was altered. The proteins that show such size dependence in their adsorption behavior are involved in all kinds of biological processes, hence, they could not be attributed to a functional class. Interestingly, they were able to identify individual proteins (e.g., prothrombin or gelsolin) showing a higher affinity for larger SiNPs (110 nm) but also other proteins (e.g., clusterin) with higher affinities to smaller SiNPs (20 nm). \n\nMany other proteins such as immunoglobulin (Ig) G or actin showed no dependence on the NP size. The complexity of protein corona formation under physiological conditions is impressively emphasized by this study: A single physical parameter such as the NP size can dramatically change the composition of the protein corona around NPs that are otherwise identical. Intriguingly, the detailed evaluation of the data did not confirm the previously suggested [22,43,160,161] trivial link between the binding profiles on the NPs and the relative protein concentrations in the plasma.",

Based on these data, computational modeling may reveal qualitative and quantitative structure-activity relationships. [232,233] Elaborate compilations may also allow the training of machine learning algorithms to predict biological responses even without understanding the underlying processes. [234] o far, there has been a strong research focus on protein adsorption onto NPs, which is motivated by the abundance of proteins and their ability to engage in specific interactions. However, there are other relevant classes of biological molecules (lipids, nucleic acids, metabolites), and a comprehensive view of the bio-nano interface requires us to also examine their role in the biomolecular corona and the ensuing biological responses, e.g., cell signaling and metabolism. [216,235] ipids are insoluble in aqueous solvents and thus transported in blood as roughly spherical lipoprotein particles with sizes in the range <10-1000 nm, featuring a lipid core that is solubilized by surface functionalization with apolipoproteins. Little is known about the mechanisms through which these natural particles interact with synthetic NPs: Will lipoproteins attach to NPs as whole particles, or transfer their material, lipids and apolipoproteins, partially or completely to the NPs? Another important group of molecules is metabolites, small (<1 kDa) organic molecules that may adsorb onto NPs and thereby alter their physicochemical properties and the biological effects. [216] ven smaller entities such as (metal) ions, e.g., Zn 2+ , can affect corona formation in a major way due to their ability to form stable complexes with various chemical groups on the surfaces of the NPs and proteins.

[65][66][67][68] Effectively what it means is that, the original nanoparticle surface is not seen by the cell membrane, but rather those biomolecules which remain on the nanoparticle surface for long enough. Thus, cell membrane receptors will interact with biomolecules in the corona, and, presumably, this interaction will determine by which mechanism the nanoparticle enters the cell. 69,70 Subsequently, one would hypothesize that once inside, the biomolecules in the corona -if, indeed, the remain associated with the nanoparticle 71-73 -will determine to where the nanoparticle is shuttled, including if it is sent through to the other side of the barrier. This puts the spotlight on identifying which biomolecules are found in the corona, and which remain there for long times. It is noteworthy that the corona composition is not a simple reflection of the biofluid in which the nanoparticle is found. That is, if a nanoparticle is put into blood plasma with serum albumin as its main component, this does not imply that serum albumin is the main component of the nanoparticle corona. 49 Rather, low abundant species are frequently picked up by nanoparticles, and, in general, the corona depends strongly on nanoparticle properties such as surface, 74 size, 61,74 shape 75 and even concentration of the biofluid. 60 Importance in vivo It seems clear that the corona will be a key determinant of how the nanoparticles are processed in vivo. In a sense, this has already been partly demonstrated.

However, these positively charged nanocomplexes are easily adsorbed with the negatively charged plasma proteins in blood circulation after administration, which is known as the formation of protein corona on nanoparticles [127][128][129][130]. The formation of protein corona is believed to negatively affect the circulation time and the delivery efficiency of payloads [131][132][133]. For example, the interaction between nanoparticles and plasma proteins may alter the uptake and clearance of nanoparticles, thereby affecting the delivery efficiency. It was observed that the protein corona of SPIONs increased the endothelial permeability and uptake of endothelial cells [134]. The increase in hydrodynamic size provoked by the formulation of the protein corona also was reported to drive uptake mechanisms, such as macropinocytosis, further influencing the uptake of nanoparticles [135]. Moreover, the adsorption of plasma proteins on nanoparticles may also induce preferential cellular uptake by immune cells through the recognition of specific complement proteins in the corona, thus decreasing the biodistribution of nanoparticles in tumor cells and resulting in a rapid clearance of nanoparticles [136]. In addition, the adsorption of plasma protein or other kinds of biomacromolecules on IONPs may decrease stability and induce the aggregation of IONPs into micron\u2212sized clusters [137]. For example, Safi et al. observed that the formation of protein corona had significant impacts on the dispersibility of IONPs in biological fluids [138]. \n\nTherefore, adopting surface modification to reduce the formation of protein corona on the surface of IONPs is of great significance to reduce clearance by the immune system, increase the blood circulation time, and improve the colloidal stability in biological fluids. For instance, Groult et al. showed that surface modification using phosphatidylcholine could prolong the circulation time and enhance the stability of IONPs due to the resistance of the protein's adsorption [139].",

(2020) studied a set of polymeric nanomaterials with varying circulation times in mice and used proteomics protocols to probe the protein corona. This in vivo \"fingerprinting\" study showed that the protein corona changed dynamically over time. Hence, coagulation and complement proteins were decreased and immunoglobulins, acute phase reactants, and lipoproteins were increased in abundance over time. The authors found that nanoparticles that circulated longer were apparently able to shed some of the initial surface bound common opsonins, and they speculated that this continuous remodeling of surface bound proteins may be an important step in dictating the in vivo fate of soft nanomaterials in mice. \n\nPEGylation remains a common strategy for the preparation of long-circulating nanoparticles, although, as we have seen, this surface modification does not prevent protein binding altogether. Hacene et al. (2021) developed an ingenious immunoprecipitation method using anti-PEG antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads to extract different PEGylated particles including polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. Using Balb/c mice, the authors injected PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles intravenously, and blood was collected 15 min after dosing. After separation of red blood cells, the nanoparticles were quantitatively recovered from plasma (thus suggesting that the epitope recognized by the anti-PEG antibody remains available on the surface of the nanoparticles even in the presence of a protein corona). The authors determined the composition of the surface adsorbed proteins and found that apolipoproteins were enriched on the surface of the nanoparticles (Hacene et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex.

Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle.

Understanding the corona formation process is crucial in predicting nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, including applications of nanotoxicology and development of nano drug delivery platforms. Method This paper extends the modeling work in to derive a mathematical model describing the dynamics of nanoparticle corona complex formation from population balance equations. We apply nonlinear dynamics techniques to derive analytical results for the composition of nanoparticle-protein corona complex, and validate our results through numerical simulations. Results The model presented in this paper exhibits two phases of corona complex dynamics. In the first phase, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of nanoparticles, leading to a metastable composition. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with nanoparticles slowly changes the composition of the corona complex. Given sufficient time, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition. We find analytical approximate formulae for metastable and stable compositions of corona complex. Our formulae are very well-structured to clearly identify important parameters determining corona composition. Conclusion The dynamics of biocorona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between nanoparticles and living organisms. Our results further understanding of these dynamics through quantitation of experimental conditions, modeling results for in vitro systems to better predict behavior for in vivo systems.

We conclude with a critical assessment of the key problems that need to be resolved in the near future."

As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al., 2013)). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al., 2007))."

In particular, the complex behaviors of nanoparticles under physiological conditions are poorly understood, and detailed kinetic and thermodynamic principles are still not available to guide the rational design and development of nanoparticle agents. Here we discuss the interactions of nanoparticles with proteins, cells, tissues, and organs from a quantitative physical chemistry point of view. We also discuss insights and strategies on how to minimize nonspecific protein binding, how to design multistage and activatable nanostructures for improved drug delivery, and how to use the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver imaging agents for image-guided cancer surgery."

The adsorption of plasma proteins, lipids and other molecules on the surface of NPs leads to the formation of a stratum of these molecules, commonly called 'protein corona' (PC), as the majority of the adsorbed molecules are proteins [21,22]...The chemical structure of the PC and the kinetics of changes of its configuration depend on the affinities of proteins towards the functional groups located on the surface of NPs, but also on the proteins' concentration. Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23]...In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate. The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer. The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface. These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low. Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible. Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place. As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24]. There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25]26].",

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants.

However, a comprehensive knowledge of particle-guided protein fingerprints and their dependence on nanomaterial properties is incomplete. We studied the long-lived (\"hard\") blood plasma derived corona on monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles differing in size (20, 30, and 100 nm). Employing label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting the composition of the protein corona was analyzed not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Detected proteins were bioinformatically classified according to their physicochemical and biological properties. Binding of the 125 identified proteins did not simply reflect their relative abundance in the plasma but revealed an enrichment of specific lipoproteins as well as proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway. In contrast, immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins displayed a lower affinity for the particles. Protein decoration of the negatively charged particles did not correlate with protein size or charge, demonstrating that electrostatic effects alone are not the major driving force regulating the nanoparticle-protein interaction. Remarkably, even differences in particle size of only 10 nm significantly determined the nanoparticle corona, although no clear correlation with particle surface volume, protein size, or charge was evident. Particle size quantitatively influenced the particle's decoration with 37% of all identified proteins, including (patho)biologically relevant candidates. We demonstrate the complexity of the plasma corona and its still unresolved physicochemical regulation, which need to be considered in nanobioscience in the future.",

This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior.",

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future.",

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity.

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

The biological effects arising from the presence of protein corona can be both beneficial and unfavourable to the biomedical applications of nanoparticles. The protein corona-cell interactions open up the feasibility of targeted delivery and cell-specific uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and in other circumstances, engineering of nanoparticles as adjuvants for vaccine development as well as mitigation of the unintentional cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles.

Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5\u2009kDa) per 100\u2009nm2 prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density.

This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo.",

Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and delivery of such systems is complicated by the complexity of the dynamic supramolecular assembly as well as by its subsequent interactions with the biological milieu. We have developed an ex vivo method that provides insight into how LNPs behave when contacted with biological fluids. Pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was used to directly measure the kinetics of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) shedding from siRNA encapsulated LNPs in rat serum. The method represents a molecularly specific, real-time, quantitative, and label-free way to monitor the behavior of a nanoparticle surface coating.

We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance.",

These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles.

Most of these systems are designed to be administered intravenously. This administration route allows the nanoparticles (NPs) to widely distribute in the body and reach deep organs without invasive techniques. When these nanovectors encounter the biological environment of systemic circulation, a dynamic interplay occurs between the circulating proteins and the NPs, themselves. The set of proteins that bind to the NP surface is referred to as the protein corona (PC). PC has a critical role in making the particles easily recognized by the innate immune system, causing their quick clearance by phagocytic cells located in organs such as the lungs, liver, and spleen. For the same reason, PC defines the immunogenicity of NPs by priming the immune response to them and, ultimately, their immunological toxicity. Furthermore, the protein corona can cause the physical destabilization and agglomeration of particles. These problems induced to consider the PC only as a biological barrier to overcome in order to achieve efficient NP-based targeting. This review will discuss the latest advances in the characterization of PC, development of stealthy NP formulations, as well as the manipulation and employment of PC as an alternative resource for prolonging NP half-life, as well as its use in diagnostic applications.",

Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface (Lima et al., 2020)[51].

The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]...According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface (Vroman, 1962).

Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

The 15 nm nanoparticles (NP1), the 45 nm nanoparticles (NP2), and the rod-shaped nanoparticles (NR) enter into cells via a receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) pathway. The star-shaped nanoparticles (NS) adopt not only clathrin-mediated, but also caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathways. However, the 80 nm nanoparitcles (NP3) mainly enter into the cells by macropinocytosis pathway due to the big size. Furthermore, the results indicate that the presence of protein corona can change the uptake mechanisms of Au NPs. The endocytosis pathway of NP1, NP2, and NS changes from RME to macropinocytosis pathway and NR changes from RME to clathrin and caveolin-independent pathway under the non-fetal bovine serun (FBS)-coated condition. Both FBS-coated and non-FBS-coated of five types of Au NPs are released out through the lysosomal exocytosis pathway. The size, shape, and protein corona have an effect on the exocytosis ratio and amount, but do not change the exocytosis mechanism. The systematic study of the endocytosis and exocytosis mechanism of Au NPs with different sizes and shapes will benefit the toxicology evaluation and nanomedicine application of Au NPs."

The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC (Zhang et al., 2018). Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment (Charbgoo et al., 2018).",

This workflow provides an effective method to predict the functional composition of the protein corona that determines cell recognition to guide the synthesis and applications of NPs. Protein corona formation is critical for the design of ideal and safe nanoparticles (NPs) for nanomedicine, biosensing, organ targeting, and other applications, but methods to quantitatively predict the formation of the protein corona, especially for functional compositions, remain unavailable. The traditional linear regression model performs poorly for the protein corona, as measured by R2 (less than 0.40). Here, the performance with R2 over 0.75 in the prediction of the protein corona was achieved by integrating a machine learning model and meta-analysis.

According to experimental verification, the functional protein compositions (e.g., immune proteins, complement proteins, and apolipoproteins) in complex coronas were precisely predicted with good R2 (most over 0.80). Moreover, the method successfully predicted the cellular recognition (e.g., cellular uptake by macrophages and cytokine release) mediated by functional corona proteins.

Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues.

Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake.

The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor.

By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona.

We have developed a strategy to quantitatively analyze the adsorption and conformational features of transferrin on gold nanoparticles that are functionalized with d, l, and racemic penicillamine. We used a quartz microbalance platform to monitor the interaction of the adsorbed transferrin with transferrin receptors in HEK cell-derived liposomes. Results show that the chiral surface of nanoparticle determines the orientation and conformation of transferrin, which subsequently affects the interaction and recognition of transferrin with its receptor on the cellular membrane. Transferrin is widely used as a tumor-targeting ligand in cancer treatment and diagnosis since the transferrin receptor is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various types of cancer cells. Thus, the present results will help to expand the knowledge on biological identity of nanoparticles with chiral surfaces in a physiological environment and provide an insight into the rational design of therapeutic nanoparticles.",

While the layer thickness of the protein corona has been well characterized in many cases, the absolute number of bound proteins and their exchange dynamics in body fluids is difficult to assess. Here we measure the number of molecules adsorbed to sulfonate (PSOSO(3)H) and carboxyl-(PSCOOH) polystyrene NPs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the fraction of molecules bound to NPs falls onto a single, universal adsorption curve, if plotted as a function of molar protein-to-NP ratio. The adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined protein-to-NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange, if competing unlabeled is added. In the presence of plasma proteins, the hard corona is stable, while the soft corona is almost completely removed. The existence of two distinct time scales in the protein off-kinetics, for both NP types studied here, indicates the possibility of an exposure memory effect in the NP corona.",

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility.",

Dynamic formation of protein coating around nanoparticles is a key molecular event, which may strongly impact the biological response in nanotoxicological tests. In this work, by using citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes as a model, we show, by several spectroscopic techniques (dynamic light scattering, UV-visible, plasmon resonance light scattering), that proteins-NP interactions are differently mediated by two widely used cellular media (i.e., Dulbecco Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with fetal bovine serum). We found that, while DMEM elicits the formation of a large time-dependent protein corona, RPMI shows different dynamics with reduced protein coating. Characterization of these nanobioentities was also performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, revealing that the average composition of protein corona does not reflect the relative abundance of serum proteins. To evaluate the biological impact of such hybrid bionanostructures, several comparative viability assays onto two cell lines (HeLa and U937) were carried out in the two media, in the presence of 15 nm AuNPs. We observed that proteins/NP complexes formed in RPMI are more abundantly internalized in cells as compared to DMEM, overall exerting higher cytotoxic effects. These results show that, beyond an in-depth NPs characterization before cellular experiments, a detailed understanding of the effects elicited by cell culture media on NPs is crucial for standardized nanotoxicology tests."

Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation. The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments.\n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020).",

Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues.

An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

The physicochemical assay was held in water HPLC-grade and Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), in order to determine whether these systems can be used as drug or antigen delivery nanosystems. Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the \u03b6-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 25\u2009\u00b0C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability."

NPs are labeled with 19F and their diffusion coefficient measured using 19F diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 19F diffusion NMR measurements of hydrodynamic radii allow for in situ characterization of NPs in complex environments by quantification of protein adsorption to the surface of NPs, as determined by increase in hydrodynamic radius. The methodology is not optics based, and thus can be used in turbid environments, as in the presence of cells.In situ detection of protein coronas is usually performed via optical methods, but light scattering may hamper these measurements.

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity.

A barrier to improved understanding is the fact that many of the factors involved (chain length, chain density, hydration, conformation, and distal chemistry) are inherently correlated. We hypothesize that, by comparing systems of variable but precisely known chain density, it should be possible to gain additional insight into the effects of the other factors. To evaluate this hypothesis, chain-end-thiolated PEOs were chemisorbed to gold-coated silicon wafers such that a range of chain densities was obtained. Three different PEOs were investigated: hydroxy-terminated chains of molecular weight 600 (600-OH), methoxy-terminated chains of molecular weight 750 (750-OCH3), and methoxy-terminated chains of molecular weight 2000 (2000-OCH3). In situ null ellipsometry was used to determine PEO chemisorption kinetics, ultimate PEO chain densities, protein adsorption kinetics, and ultimate protein adsorbed quantities. With this approach, it was possible to ascertain the effects of PEO distal chemistry (-OH, -OCH3), chain length, and layer hydration on protein adsorption. The data obtained suggested that properties related to chain density (conformational freedom, hydration) were the main determinants of protein resistance at chain densities up to a critical value of approximately 0.5 chain/nm2; at this value, protein adsorption was a minimum for the methoxy-terminated PEOs. For the hydroxyl-terminated PEO, adsorption leveled off at the critical value. Thus distal chemistry appears to be a major determinant of protein resistance at chain densities greater than the critical value."

These serum proteins can block nanoparticle tumour targeting ligands from binding to tumour cell receptors. Additionally, serum proteins can also encourage nanoparticle uptake by macrophages, which decreases nanoparticle availability in the blood and limits tumour accumulation. The formation of this protein corona will also increase the nanoparticle hydrodynamic size or induce aggregation, which makes nanoparticles too large to enter into the tumour through pores of the leaky vessels, and prevents their deep penetration into tumours for cell targeting.

The alpha C domains make weak electrostatic contact with the substrate, which is manifest by a high degree of alignment of Lys and Arg residues.

The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense (Casals et al., 2010), based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds (Lazarovits et al., 2015), which is known as the Vroman effect (Jung et al., 2003). The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2014), the time of exposure (Lazarovits et al., 2015)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic (Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010). Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona (Lundqvist et al., 2011)"

This should provide the foundational understanding needed for the rest of the answer.\n\nFor the main dimensions, I will focus on:\n\n1. \"Introduction/Background of Biomolecular Corona on LNPs\": This section will provide basic information about what a biomolecular corona is, how it forms on nanoparticles, especially LNPs, and why it's important. This should be a synthesis paragraph as it needs to establish foundational knowledge coherently.\n\n2. \"Temporal Sequence and Dynamics of Corona Formation\": This dimension will cover the stepwise process of corona formation, from initial protein adsorption to equilibrium state, including the Vroman effect and other dynamic processes. A synthesis format is appropriate here to explain the sequential and interconnected nature of these processes.\n\n3. \"Hard vs. Soft Corona Structure and Properties\": The quotes frequently mention the distinction between hard and soft coronas. This section will explain their differences, formation mechanisms, and functional implications. This should be synthesized into a coherent explanation rather than a list.\n\n4. \"PEG Shedding Mechanisms\": Several quotes specifically mention PEG shedding as a crucial mechanism affecting corona formation on LNPs. This deserves its own section due to its importance in LNP functionality. A synthesis paragraph is appropriate to explain this complex process.\n\n5. \"Affinity Dynamics and Molecular Interactions\": This dimension will focus on the specific molecular forces and interactions (electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, etc.) that govern protein adsorption and exchange on LNP surfaces. This should be a synthesis to properly explain these interrelated forces.\n\n6. \"Physicochemical Factors Affecting Corona Composition\": This will cover how properties of LNPs (size, charge, surface chemistry) influence which proteins adsorb and how they arrange. A synthesis is appropriate to explain these interconnected factors.\n\n7. \"Functional Consequences of Corona Formation\": This dimension will explain how the corona affects the biological identity and functionality of LNPs, including tissue targeting and cellular uptake. This should be a synthesis to properly explain the causal relationships.\n\nThis organization follows a logical progression from basic understanding to specific mechanisms to functional outcomes, which will help address all aspects of the query comprehensively.",

As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al., 2013)). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al., 2007))."

Here we review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona and its structure and composition, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts.

                            "Background Nanoparticle-protein corona complex formation involves absorption of protein molecules onto nanoparticle surfaces in a physiological environment. Understanding the corona formation process is crucial in predicting nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, including applications of nanotoxicology and development of nano drug delivery platforms. Method This paper extends the modeling work in to derive a mathematical model describing the dynamics of nanoparticle corona complex formation from population balance equations. We apply nonlinear dynamics techniques to derive analytical results for the composition of nanoparticle-protein corona complex, and validate our results through numerical simulations. Results The model presented in this paper exhibits two phases of corona complex dynamics. In the first phase, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of nanoparticles, leading to a metastable composition. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with nanoparticles slowly changes the composition of the corona complex. Given sufficient time, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition. We find analytical approximate formulae for metastable and stable compositions of corona complex. Our formulae are very well-structured to clearly identify important parameters determining corona composition. Conclusion The dynamics of biocorona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between nanoparticles and living organisms. Our results further understanding of these dynamics through quantitation of experimental conditions, modeling results for in vitro systems to better predict behavior for in vivo systems. One potential application would involve a single cell culture medium related to a complex protein medium, such as blood or tissue fluid."

                            "Nanoparticles entering a biological environment undergo surface modification owing to dynamic physicochemical interactions with proteins and other biomolecules in the extracellular fluids. The adsorption of plasma proteins, lipids and other molecules on the surface of NPs leads to the formation of a stratum of these molecules, commonly called 'protein corona' (PC), as the majority of the adsorbed molecules are proteins [21,22]",
                            "The chemical structure of the PC and the kinetics of changes of its configuration depend on the affinities of proteins towards the functional groups located on the surface of NPs, but also on the proteins' concentration. Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23]",
                            "In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate. The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer. The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface. These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low. Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible. Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place. As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24]. There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25]26]."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

                            "Based on the affinity, binding, and dissociation rate, protein corona are classified into hard and soft PC (Liu et al., 2019)[19]. The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC (Zhang et al., 2018). Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment (Charbgoo et al., 2018)."

Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e[20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment (Lane et al., 2015). The physicochemical properties of the NP surfaces greatly affect protein adsorption and thereby control the properties of the biomolecular corona, which mediates the interaction between nanomaterials and the biological environment."

                            "Nanomedicine is an interdisciplinary field of research at the interface of science, engineering, and medicine, with broad clinical applications ranging from molecular imaging to medical diagnostics, targeted therapy, and image-guided surgery. Despite major advances during the past 20 years, there are still major fundamental and technical barriers that need to be understood and overcome. In particular, the complex behaviors of nanoparticles under physiological conditions are poorly understood, and detailed kinetic and thermodynamic principles are still not available to guide the rational design and development of nanoparticle agents. Here we discuss the interactions of nanoparticles with proteins, cells, tissues, and organs from a quantitative physical chemistry point of view. We also discuss insights and strategies on how to minimize nonspecific protein binding, how to design multistage and activatable nanostructures for improved drug delivery, and how to use the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver imaging agents for image-guided cancer surgery."

Hence, blood circulation time, biodistribution and targeting of nanocarriers can be influenced. The NP characteristics like size, shape and surface composition, as well as environmental parameters like temperature and type of fluid can affect the composition of the protein corona [ 16 , 17 ]. Corona proteins can either act as opsonins and mark NPs for rapid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system or they act as dysopsonins mediating longer blood circulation times [18]."

                            "In biological fluids, proteins associate with nanoparticles, leading to a protein \"corona\" defining the biological identity of the particle. However, a comprehensive knowledge of particle-guided protein fingerprints and their dependence on nanomaterial properties is incomplete. We studied the long-lived (\"hard\") blood plasma derived corona on monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles differing in size (20, 30, and 100 nm). Employing label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting the composition of the protein corona was analyzed not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Detected proteins were bioinformatically classified according to their physicochemical and biological properties. Binding of the 125 identified proteins did not simply reflect their relative abundance in the plasma but revealed an enrichment of specific lipoproteins as well as proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway. In contrast, immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins displayed a lower affinity for the particles. Protein decoration of the negatively charged particles did not correlate with protein size or charge, demonstrating that electrostatic effects alone are not the major driving force regulating the nanoparticle-protein interaction. Remarkably, even differences in particle size of only 10 nm significantly determined the nanoparticle corona, although no clear correlation with particle surface volume, protein size, or charge was evident. Particle size quantitatively influenced the particle's decoration with 37% of all identified proteins, including (patho)biologically relevant candidates. We demonstrate the complexity of the plasma corona and its still unresolved physicochemical regulation, which need to be considered in nanobioscience in the future."

                            "Unless they are specifically designed to avoid it, NPs are rapidly covered, in contact with biological fluids, by a selected group of biomolecules to form a corona that interacts with biological systems. As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al., 2013)). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al., 2007))."

Understanding the corona formation process is crucial in predicting nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, including applications of nanotoxicology and development of nano drug delivery platforms. Method This paper extends the modeling work in to derive a mathematical model describing the dynamics of nanoparticle corona complex formation from population balance equations. We apply nonlinear dynamics techniques to derive analytical results for the composition of nanoparticle-protein corona complex, and validate our results through numerical simulations. Results The model presented in this paper exhibits two phases of corona complex dynamics. In the first phase, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of nanoparticles, leading to a metastable composition. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with nanoparticles slowly changes the composition of the corona complex. Given sufficient time, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition. We find analytical approximate formulae for metastable and stable compositions of corona complex. Our formulae are very well-structured to clearly identify important parameters determining corona composition. Conclusion The dynamics of biocorona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between nanoparticles and living organisms. Our results further understanding of these dynamics through quantitation of experimental conditions, modeling results for in vitro systems to better predict behavior for in vivo systems. One potential application would involve a single cell culture medium related to a complex protein medium, such as blood or tissue fluid."

                            "The dynamics of protein corona formation is governed by several forces such as electrostatic, van-der-Waals, and hydrophobic interaction. Different conclusions regarding the mechanism of protein corona formation have been reported. A simplistic diffusion-based approach was put forward by Leo Vroman that described adsorption kinetics of proteins for several at and curved NPs surfaces. The Vroman effect states that during NPs incubation in a complex multiprotein system, the high mobility proteins (having low molecular weight) arrive rst and adsorb on the NPs surface, in the due course of time the adsorbed proteins are replaced by more stable less mobile proteins that have a higher binding affinity for the NPs. To put it simply, a critical balance between the kinetics and thermodynamics of proteins determines the corona formation on the NPs surface. In another theory put forward by Hirish et al. it is described that the entire dynamic exchange occurs via the formation of \"transient complex\". Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis suggest that adsorption of the initial layer of proteins is followed by the embedding of the second layer of protein which in turn results in a formation of multilayered aggregate. The aggregated complex (transient complex) nally exposes the initially adsorbed proteins which desorb from the NPs surface into the solution leaving the NPs with the proteins. A better understanding of the evolution of protein corona is explained by the dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) which combines the steric and electrostatic interactions."

                            "When AuNPs are introduced into biological systems, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other biomolecules (like lipids) forming a tightly bound biomolecular (around 20-30 nm thick) corona, termed the protein corona (Figure 1) (Ding et al., 2018). Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface (Lima et al., 2020)[51]. The protein corona is made up of both hard and soft layers, depending on the affinity of the proteins for the nanoparticle surface. The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]",
                            "According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface (Vroman, 1962). Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]."

The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC (Zhang et al., 2018). Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment (Charbgoo et al., 2018)."

                            "Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes.\n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time. Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation. The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments.\n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces."

The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense (Casals et al., 2010), based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds (Lazarovits et al., 2015), which is known as the Vroman effect (Jung et al., 2003). The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2014), the time of exposure (Lazarovits et al., 2015)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic (Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010). Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona (Lundqvist et al., 2011)",

                            "The importance of the protein corona formed around nanoparticles upon entering a biological fluid has recently been highlighted. This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior."

Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23]",
                            "In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate. The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer. The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface. These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low. Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible. Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place. As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24]. There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25]26]."

                            "Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes.\n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time. Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation. The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments.\n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces."

                            "When AuNPs are introduced into biological systems, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other biomolecules (like lipids) forming a tightly bound biomolecular (around 20-30 nm thick) corona, termed the protein corona (Figure 1) (Ding et al., 2018). Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface (Lima et al., 2020)[51]. The protein corona is made up of both hard and soft layers, depending on the affinity of the proteins for the nanoparticle surface. The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]",
                            "According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface (Vroman, 1962). Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

The hard PC is formed within several seconds, its most surface proximal layer is characterised by longer residence time, more stable composition, and modest protein exchange with a protein-abundant environment. The soft PC is formed following the completion of hard corona formation, reaching equilibrium with the hard PC and environment within several minutes to several hours. The soft PC is more distal from the NP surface and more susceptible to exchange and interaction with other proteins in the biological environment. Some authors distinguish the third part-interfacial PC (Zhang et al., 2018). Since PC formation is a dynamic process, complex surface-protein and protein-protein interactions are not only dependent on the NP properties, but also on the biological environment (Charbgoo et al., 2018)."

                            "Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications."

The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type. The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins. The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation."

The biological fates and functions of nanoparticles are determined by physiological responses toward these nanoparticle-protein corona complexes as the effective biological unit of nanoparticles. In this article, we review representative studies on the effects of particle physicochemical characteristics along with the protein profiles in the biological medium on the formation of protein corona and importantly, how the dynamic nature and protein fingerprints of the formed corona govern the biological responses toward nanoparticles. The biological effects arising from the presence of protein corona can be both beneficial and unfavourable to the biomedical applications of nanoparticles. The protein corona-cell interactions open up the feasibility of targeted delivery and cell-specific uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and in other circumstances, engineering of nanoparticles as adjuvants for vaccine development as well as mitigation of the unintentional cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the protein corona-cell interactions could induce rapid clearance of nanoparticles from in vivo circulation as well as activating unwanted inflammatory responses. Taken together, the knowledge on the formation and biological effects of protein corona enables tailored tuning of the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, unique to their intended biological activity."

                            "Size, shape, and protein corona play a key role in cellular uptake and removal mechanisms of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The 15 nm nanoparticles (NP1), the 45 nm nanoparticles (NP2), and the rod-shaped nanoparticles (NR) enter into cells via a receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) pathway. The star-shaped nanoparticles (NS) adopt not only clathrin-mediated, but also caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathways. However, the 80 nm nanoparitcles (NP3) mainly enter into the cells by macropinocytosis pathway due to the big size. Furthermore, the results indicate that the presence of protein corona can change the uptake mechanisms of Au NPs. The endocytosis pathway of NP1, NP2, and NS changes from RME to macropinocytosis pathway and NR changes from RME to clathrin and caveolin-independent pathway under the non-fetal bovine serun (FBS)-coated condition. Both FBS-coated and non-FBS-coated of five types of Au NPs are released out through the lysosomal exocytosis pathway. The size, shape, and protein corona have an effect on the exocytosis ratio and amount, but do not change the exocytosis mechanism. The systematic study of the endocytosis and exocytosis mechanism of Au NPs with different sizes and shapes will benefit the toxicology evaluation and nanomedicine application of Au NPs."

The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense (Casals et al., 2010), based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds (Lazarovits et al., 2015), which is known as the Vroman effect (Jung et al., 2003). The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2014), the time of exposure (Lazarovits et al., 2015)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic (Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010). Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010), unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona (Lundqvist et al., 2011)",

                            "In vitro incubation of nanomaterials with plasma offer insights on biological interactions, but cannot fully explain the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Here, we use a library of polymer nanoparticles to show how physicochemical characteristics influence blood circulation and early distribution. For particles with different diameters, surface hydrophilicity appears to mediate early clearance. Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5\u2009kDa) per 100\u2009nm2 prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density. These results further our understanding of nanopharmacology. Understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and biomolecules is crucial for improving current drug-delivery systems. Here, the authors shed light on the essential role of the surface and other physicochemical properties of a library of nanoparticles on their in vivo pharmacokinetics."

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

                            "The use of nanocarriers in biology and medicine is complicated by the current need to understand how nanoparticles interact in complex biological surroundings. When nanocarriers come into contact with serum, proteins immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a protein corona which defines their biological identity. Although the composition of the protein corona has been widely determined by proteomics, its morphology still remains unclear. In this study we show for the first time the morphology of the protein corona using transmission electron microscopy. We are able to demonstrate that the protein corona is not, as commonly supposed, a dense, layered shell coating the nanoparticle, but an undefined, loose network of proteins. Additionally, we are now able to visualize and discriminate between the soft and hard corona using centrifugation-based separation techniques together with proteomic characterization. The protein composition of the \u223c15 nm hard corona strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the respective nanomaterial, thus further affecting cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Large diameter protein corona resulting from pre-incubation with soft corona or Apo-A1 inhibits cellular uptake, confirming the stealth-effect mechanism. In summary, the knowledge on protein corona formation, composition and morphology is essential to design therapeutic effective nanoparticle systems."

                            "Protein adsorption to nanoparticles (NPs) is a key prerequisite to understand NP-cell interactions. While the layer thickness of the protein corona has been well characterized in many cases, the absolute number of bound proteins and their exchange dynamics in body fluids is difficult to assess. Here we measure the number of molecules adsorbed to sulfonate (PSOSO(3)H) and carboxyl-(PSCOOH) polystyrene NPs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the fraction of molecules bound to NPs falls onto a single, universal adsorption curve, if plotted as a function of molar protein-to-NP ratio. The adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined protein-to-NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange, if competing unlabeled is added. In the presence of plasma proteins, the hard corona is stable, while the soft corona is almost completely removed. The existence of two distinct time scales in the protein off-kinetics, for both NP types studied here, indicates the possibility of an exposure memory effect in the NP corona."

                            "The importance of the protein corona formed around nanoparticles upon entering a biological fluid has recently been highlighted. This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior."

The rate of PEG shedding is primarily determined by the length of the lipid anchor chain, with shorter chains (C14) shedding rapidly compared to longer chains (C18), creating a balance between initial stability and subsequent cellular uptake.

                "text": "\nWhen lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enter biological environments, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules that initially stabilize them begin to dissociate from the particle surface in a process known as \"PEG shedding.\" This mechanism is critical for balancing the dual requirements of LNP stability and cellular uptake efficiency. The PEG coating plays a crucial role in maintaining LNP size and stability before administration while minimizing unwanted protein adsorption in circulation, but if not properly optimized, it can significantly inhibit cellular uptake and reduce RNA activity <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"483292\" paperTitle=\"(Mishra et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe rate of PEG shedding is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length - formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more rapidly than those with longer chains <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46643688\" paperTitle=\"(Wilson et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This difference has been quantified, with desorption rates of 45% h\u207b\u00b9, 1.3% h\u207b\u00b9, and 0.2% h\u207b\u00b9 observed for C14, C16, and C18 chains, respectively <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe precise mechanism behind PEG shedding involves interactions with serum proteins, though the specific proteins involved and their role remain under investigation <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have demonstrated that incubation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) increases the rate of PEG shedding, with the effect being proportional to both the amount of FBS present and the incubation time <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that serum proteins play an active role in facilitating PEG detachment, though the exact molecular interactions driving this process require further elucidation.\n\nPEG shedding is now recognized as a crucial step in the three-stage mechanism of LNP targeting in vivo. First, PEG-lipids desorb from the LNP surface; second, specific proteins bind to the exposed LNP surface; and third, these surface-bound proteins interact with tissue-specific receptors <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

While PEGylation at high densities can reduce protein adsorption by 94-99% relative to non-PEGylated nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"51606268\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31975084\" paperTitle=\"(Walkey et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>, excessive PEG coverage can destabilize nanoparticle integrity and block ligand molecules, limiting the maximum amount of PEG that can be effectively incorporated <Paper corpusId=\"273883327\" paperTitle=\"(Lee, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Furthermore, complete prevention of protein corona formation through extensive PEGylation may not always be desirable, as the protein corona can facilitate targeted delivery through endogenous mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe concept of controlled PEG shedding represents a strategic approach to overcome what has been termed the \"PEG dilemma\" - the trade-off between extended circulation time and reduced cellular internalization <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Alternative approaches to address this challenge include the development of stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives that can detach in response to specific environmental triggers <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> and the exploration of alternative coatings such as Poloxamers that can enhance selective protein adsorption <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244713297\" paperTitle=\"(Tsakiri et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnderstanding and controlling PEG shedding kinetics is essential for optimizing LNP delivery systems, as it creates a synergistic relationship between PEG dissociation and protein corona formation that ultimately determines particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73476676\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. (Chen et al., 2016)(Mui et al., 2013)(Mishra et al., 2004) To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. (Chen et al., 2016)(Wilson et al., 2015) Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. (Mui et al., 2013)(Li et al., 2013) The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. (Chen et al., 2019) Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195"

                            "In vitro studies of non-viral gene delivery vectors are typically not performed at physiological conditions, and thus may not provide meaningful results for in vivo investigations. We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."

                            "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a novel therapeutic modality that benefits from nanoparticle mediated delivery. The most clinically advanced siRNA-containing nanoparticles are polymer-coated supramolecular assemblies of siRNA and lipids (lipid nanoparticles or LNPs), which protect the siRNA from nucleases, modulate pharmacokinetics of the siRNA, and enable selective delivery of siRNA to target cells. Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and delivery of such systems is complicated by the complexity of the dynamic supramolecular assembly as well as by its subsequent interactions with the biological milieu. We have developed an ex vivo method that provides insight into how LNPs behave when contacted with biological fluids. Pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was used to directly measure the kinetics of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) shedding from siRNA encapsulated LNPs in rat serum. The method represents a molecularly specific, real-time, quantitative, and label-free way to monitor the behavior of a nanoparticle surface coating. We believe that this method has broad implications in gaining mechanistic insights into how nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles behave in biofluids and is versatile enough to be applied to a diversity of systems."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating short interfering RNAs that target hepatic genes are advancing through clinical trials, and early results indicate the excellent gene silencing observed in rodents and nonhuman primates also translates to humans. This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo."

In numerous cases, the carbon anchor length dictates the PEG detachment, as exemplified in LNPs. When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h\u22121) to the chain length was observed. [21] This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths. Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking."

Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown."

In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "When NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona (Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009). This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities (Carril et al., 2017). Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers (Walkey et al., 2012) showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa (Unsworth et al., 2008)(Szleifer, 1997). At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake)"

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

The physicochemical assay was held in water HPLC-grade and Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), in order to determine whether these systems can be used as drug or antigen delivery nanosystems. Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the \u03b6-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 25\u2009\u00b0C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability."

However, in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media. In this study, we have formulated four types of EnCore nanoparticles (F1 to F4) with a similar composition, but different polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated lipid chain lengths (carbon 14 vs. carbon 18) and molar ratios (6% vs. 3%). These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles. Among the adsorbed proteins from FBS, apolipoprotein E, but not apolipoprotein A1, affected the cellular uptake of the carbon 14 LNPs. Additionally, surface PEG was one of the determinants for the protein corona amount and composition. Finally, different serum to LNP volume ratios resulted in different protein enrichment patterns. Overall, the results showed a correlation between surface chemistry of LNPs and the protein corona composition suggesting a potential use for targeted delivery."

                            "The dynamics of protein corona formation is governed by several forces such as electrostatic, van-der-Waals, and hydrophobic interaction. Different conclusions regarding the mechanism of protein corona formation have been reported. A simplistic diffusion-based approach was put forward by Leo Vroman that described adsorption kinetics of proteins for several at and curved NPs surfaces. The Vroman effect states that during NPs incubation in a complex multiprotein system, the high mobility proteins (having low molecular weight) arrive rst and adsorb on the NPs surface, in the due course of time the adsorbed proteins are replaced by more stable less mobile proteins that have a higher binding affinity for the NPs. To put it simply, a critical balance between the kinetics and thermodynamics of proteins determines the corona formation on the NPs surface. In another theory put forward by Hirish et al. it is described that the entire dynamic exchange occurs via the formation of \"transient complex\". Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis suggest that adsorption of the initial layer of proteins is followed by the embedding of the second layer of protein which in turn results in a formation of multilayered aggregate. The aggregated complex (transient complex) nally exposes the initially adsorbed proteins which desorb from the NPs surface into the solution leaving the NPs with the proteins. A better understanding of the evolution of protein corona is explained by the dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) which combines the steric and electrostatic interactions."

                            "When AuNPs are introduced into biological systems, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other biomolecules (like lipids) forming a tightly bound biomolecular (around 20-30 nm thick) corona, termed the protein corona (Figure 1) (Ding et al., 2018). Protein interaction with NPs surface is a dynamic and complex process, driven by a minimization of NP high surface free energy in which there is continuous absorption/desorption of different molecules that compete for the NP available surface (Lima et al., 2020)[51]. The protein corona is made up of both hard and soft layers, depending on the affinity of the proteins for the nanoparticle surface. The \"hard\" corona represents the inner layer of high-affinity proteins that usually remain irreversibly bound to the NP's surface, while the \"soft\" corona is the outer layer of weakly bound proteins that exhibit a shorter lifetime [52]",
                            "According to the Vroman effect, this process seems to be characterized in the initial step by the attachment of fast exchange protein with weak affinity (the soft corona) to NP surfaces followed by a series of movements and/or rearrangements toward irreversible protein adsorption through their displacement and the attachment of slow exchange proteins with higher affinities for NP surfaces, the hard corona, to make a more stable, strong and ultimately irreversible attachment to the surface (Vroman, 1962). Principally, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, are involved in the mechanism by which proteins attach to surfaces [56]."

                            "Nanoparticles entering a biological environment undergo surface modification owing to dynamic physicochemical interactions with proteins and other biomolecules in the extracellular fluids. The adsorption of plasma proteins, lipids and other molecules on the surface of NPs leads to the formation of a stratum of these molecules, commonly called 'protein corona' (PC), as the majority of the adsorbed molecules are proteins [21,22]",
                            "The chemical structure of the PC and the kinetics of changes of its configuration depend on the affinities of proteins towards the functional groups located on the surface of NPs, but also on the proteins' concentration. Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23]",
                            "In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate. The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer. The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface. These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low. Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible. Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place. As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24]. There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25]26]."

As shown above, NP act as scaffold for biomolecules, which adsorb rapidly to the NPs' surface and confer a new biological identity to the respective NPs (Monopoli et al., 2012). The dynamics of bio-corona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between NPs and living organisms. Initially, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of NPs. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al., 2013)). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al., 2007))."

During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with NPs slowly change the composition of the corona complex. Finally, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition (Sahneh et al. 2013). Hence, proteins compete for the NP surface, generating a protein corona that is largely defined by the biological identity of the particle. In this respect, the knowledge of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with or dissociation from NPs is important for understanding the nature of the immunological response to the particles by the functional machinery of cells (Cedervall et al. 2007a). In some cases, the protein corona may not fully saturate the surface area of nanoparticle and instead bind at discreet sites, leaving much of NP surface unobstructed, which could also affect its toxicity (Rybak-Smith and Sim 2011)."

                            "Background Nanoparticle-protein corona complex formation involves absorption of protein molecules onto nanoparticle surfaces in a physiological environment. Understanding the corona formation process is crucial in predicting nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, including applications of nanotoxicology and development of nano drug delivery platforms. Method This paper extends the modeling work in to derive a mathematical model describing the dynamics of nanoparticle corona complex formation from population balance equations. We apply nonlinear dynamics techniques to derive analytical results for the composition of nanoparticle-protein corona complex, and validate our results through numerical simulations. Results The model presented in this paper exhibits two phases of corona complex dynamics. In the first phase, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of nanoparticles, leading to a metastable composition. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with nanoparticles slowly changes the composition of the corona complex. Given sufficient time, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition. We find analytical approximate formulae for metastable and stable compositions of corona complex. Our formulae are very well-structured to clearly identify important parameters determining corona composition. Conclusion The dynamics of biocorona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between nanoparticles and living organisms. Our results further understanding of these dynamics through quantitation of experimental conditions, modeling results for in vitro systems to better predict behavior for in vivo systems. One potential application would involve a single cell culture medium related to a complex protein medium, such as blood or tissue fluid."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

                            "When NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface (Monopoli et al., 2011)(Tenzer et al., 2011).The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,(Monopoli et al., 2011).\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) (Lundqvist et al., 2008)(Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Walkey et al., 2012)(Nel et al., 2009) and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) (Monopoli et al., 2011)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Lundqvist et al., 2011).The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010).For example, experimental data (Cedervall et al., 2007) and the results of a simulation model (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010) suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8]36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety."

Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL. Conclusions The simple model presented here can easily be modified to mimic the interaction of the nanoparticle protein corona with a novel biological fluid or compartment once new data will be available, thus opening novel applications in nanotoxicity and nanomedicine."

The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type. The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins. The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation."

Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e[20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment (Lane et al., 2015).

Despite major advances during the past 20 years, there are still major fundamental and technical barriers that need to be understood and overcome. In particular, the complex behaviors of nanoparticles under physiological conditions are poorly understood, and detailed kinetic and thermodynamic principles are still not available to guide the rational design and development of nanoparticle agents. Here we discuss the interactions of nanoparticles with proteins, cells, tissues, and organs from a quantitative physical chemistry point of view. We also discuss insights and strategies on how to minimize nonspecific protein binding, how to design multistage and activatable nanostructures for improved drug delivery, and how to use the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver imaging agents for image-guided cancer surgery."

                            "It is well-known that the interaction of drug nanocarriers with serum proteins can alter the pharmacokinetics of the nanovehicles either affecting the cellular uptake or the clearance of the particles by the immune system (Pearson et al., 2014). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017)."

The surface properties of nanoparticles, including size, shape, charge, and chemical composition, play crucial roles in determining which proteins preferentially adsorb to create the corona <Paper corpusId=\"213924800\" paperTitle=\"(Nienhaus et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"211566419\" paperTitle=\"(Baboci et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

More hydrophobic surfaces attract proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity, creating a more dynamic corona with a larger proportion of proteins exhibiting fast exchange rates <Paper corpusId=\"257739269\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoudi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31345982\" paperTitle=\"(Ashby et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Increasing PEG density on nanoparticle surfaces can dramatically reduce protein adsorption in a nonlinear fashion. At the highest tested PEG densities (1.25 PEG/nm\u00b2), protein adsorption can be reduced by 94-99% relative to non-PEGylated nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"51606268\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31975084\" paperTitle=\"(Walkey et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Remarkably, differences in particle size of just 10 nm can substantially alter the protein corona profile <Paper corpusId=\"257739269\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoudi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The protein concentration in biological fluids affects corona formation, with different serum-to-nanoparticle volume ratios resulting in distinct protein enrichment patterns <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73476676\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Delivery of genetic medicines, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is a promising approach towards the treatment of diseases, such as solid tumors. However, in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media. In this study, we have formulated four types of EnCore nanoparticles (F1 to F4) with a similar composition, but different polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated lipid chain lengths (carbon 14 vs. carbon 18) and molar ratios (6% vs. 3%). These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles. Among the adsorbed proteins from FBS, apolipoprotein E, but not apolipoprotein A1, affected the cellular uptake of the carbon 14 LNPs. Additionally, surface PEG was one of the determinants for the protein corona amount and composition. Finally, different serum to LNP volume ratios resulted in different protein enrichment patterns. Overall, the results showed a correlation between surface chemistry of LNPs and the protein corona composition suggesting a potential use for targeted delivery."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes.\n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time. Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation. The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments.\n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces."

                            "Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications."

The adsorption of plasma proteins, lipids and other molecules on the surface of NPs leads to the formation of a stratum of these molecules, commonly called 'protein corona' (PC), as the majority of the adsorbed molecules are proteins [21,22]",
                            "The chemical structure of the PC and the kinetics of changes of its configuration depend on the affinities of proteins towards the functional groups located on the surface of NPs, but also on the proteins' concentration. Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form the \"hard\" corona-which consists of tightly bound proteins that are not easily desorbed-and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, which consists of poorly bound proteins [21][22][23]",
                            "In fact, the proteins that construct the \"hard\" corona will form the first layer on the surface of NPs in several hours and will have a small desorption rate. The proteins from the \"soft\" corona interact mostly with the proteins from the \"hard\" corona, forming the second layer. The \"hard\" corona does not completely cover the NP's surface, hence even proteins with low affinity have access to some functional groups located on the NP surface. These \"soft\" proteins have a higher exchange rate, as their affinities toward the functional groups of NPs surface is low. Even if the proteins' concentration in biological fluid is very low, the proteins will tend to cover the NP's surface as much as possible. Virtually, a complete surface coverage of the NP will take place. As \"soft\" proteins interact with the \"hard\" corona via weak protein-protein interactions, it may be possible for these interactions to take place even in the absence of NPs in a biological fluid [24]. There are reports of NPs, especially PEGylated ones, that have only a \"soft\" corona [25]26]."

                            "When NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona (Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009). This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities (Carril et al., 2017). Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers (Walkey et al., 2012) showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa (Unsworth et al., 2008)(Szleifer, 1997). At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake)"

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type. The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism."

Despite major advances during the past 20 years, there are still major fundamental and technical barriers that need to be understood and overcome. In particular, the complex behaviors of nanoparticles under physiological conditions are poorly understood, and detailed kinetic and thermodynamic principles are still not available to guide the rational design and development of nanoparticle agents. Here we discuss the interactions of nanoparticles with proteins, cells, tissues, and organs from a quantitative physical chemistry point of view. We also discuss insights and strategies on how to minimize nonspecific protein binding, how to design multistage and activatable nanostructures for improved drug delivery, and how to use the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver imaging agents for image-guided cancer surgery."

Understanding and controlling corona formation enables the development of more effective drug delivery systems, either by reducing protein adsorption through PEGylation or by leveraging specific protein-nanoparticle interactions for targeted delivery through \"endogenous targeting.\" (20 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhen lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enter biological fluids such as blood, the formation of a protein corona markedly transforms their properties, conferring a new biological identity that significantly differs from their original \"synthetic identity\" <Paper corpusId=\"2320684\" paperTitle=\"(Canovi et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31975084\" paperTitle=\"(Walkey et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257739269\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoudi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This transformation has profound implications for the nanoparticles' pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and interaction with cellular targets, thereby determining their therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"2320684\" paperTitle=\"(Canovi et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona significantly influences the circulatory fate of LNPs. Specific proteins within the corona can function either as opsonins (immunoglobulins, complement factors, and fibrinogen), marking nanoparticles for rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, or as dysopsonins, promoting longer blood circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"245209888\" paperTitle=\"(Barth et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This interplay between different protein components directly affects the bioavailability of therapeutic nanoparticles in the bloodstream <Paper corpusId=\"257739269\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoudi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCellular uptake mechanisms are also substantially influenced by the protein corona. Studies have demonstrated that the composition of the corona determines which cellular uptake pathways are utilized by nanoparticles, with different corona compositions potentially directing nanoparticles through different endocytic mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"202673667\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Remarkably, only stably bound proteins in the hard corona significantly enhance cellular uptake, while proteins bound in the dynamic soft corona have negligible impact on this process <Paper corpusId=\"31345982\" paperTitle=\"(Ashby et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe formation of the protein corona also affects the recognition of targeting ligands on functionalized nanoparticles. Initially, it was observed that the protein corona could hinder the effectiveness of targeting ligands by masking them <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, researchers have recognized that complete prevention of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is neither feasible nor always desirable <Paper corpusId=\"3328751\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This realization has led to the development of strategies that leverage specific protein-nanoparticle interactions for targeted delivery.\n\nThe concept of \"endogenous targeting\" has emerged as a promising approach, where the recruitment of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface can enable delivery to tissues beyond the liver <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism involves a three-stage process: PEG-lipid desorption from the LNP surface, selective protein binding to the exposed LNP surface, and interaction of these surface-bound proteins with tissue-specific receptors <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The best-understood example of this process is the ApoE-mediated liver targeting of LNPs through interactions with low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nControlling protein corona formation has become a key objective in nanomedicine development. PEGylation remains the most common strategy to reduce protein adsorption, with studies showing that high PEG densities (1.25 PEG/nm\u00b2) can reduce protein adsorption by 94-99% relative to non-PEGylated nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"51606268\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this approach creates what has been termed the \"PEG dilemma\" \u2013 while PEGylation extends circulation time, it also reduces cellular internalization <Paper corpusId=\"2116239\" paperTitle=\"(Fang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAlternative approaches to address this challenge include the development of stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives that can detach in response to specific environmental triggers <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> and the exploration of alternative coatings such as Poloxamers that can enhance selective protein adsorption <Paper corpusId=\"244713297\" paperTitle=\"(Tsakiri et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. These strategies aim to balance the competing requirements of circulation stability and efficient cellular uptake.\n\nThe conformational changes that proteins undergo following adsorption to nanoparticles further complicate corona effects. These changes can result in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions, suggesting that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"32343932\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent research indicates that the biological identity conferred by the protein corona is the primary determinant of nanoparticle-cell interactions, rather than the pristine surface of the nanoparticle <Paper corpusId=\"7805637\" paperTitle=\"(Lesniak et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This understanding has significant implications for the design of nanoparticle-based therapeutics, as it suggests that engineering the protein corona composition, rather than just the nanoparticle surface, may be a more effective strategy for controlling biodistribution and cellular targeting <Paper corpusId=\"245631187\" paperTitle=\"(Scheerstra et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn conclusion, the functional consequences of corona formation on LNPs extend throughout their biological journey, from circulation and biodistribution to cellular uptake and ultimate therapeutic effect. Understanding these consequences provides opportunities to develop more effective drug delivery systems by either minimizing unwanted protein interactions or strategically leveraging specific protein-nanoparticle interactions for targeted delivery <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "When NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface (Monopoli et al., 2011)(Tenzer et al., 2011).The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,(Monopoli et al., 2011).\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) (Lundqvist et al., 2008)(Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Walkey et al., 2012)(Nel et al., 2009) and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) (Monopoli et al., 2011)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Lundqvist et al., 2011).The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010).For example, experimental data (Cedervall et al., 2007) and the results of a simulation model (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010) suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8]36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety."

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes.\n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time. Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation. The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments.\n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces."

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

                            "Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications."

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014)"

                            "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "When NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona (Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009). This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities (Carril et al., 2017). Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers (Walkey et al., 2012) showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa (Unsworth et al., 2008)(Szleifer, 1997). At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake)"

                            "Abstract To prolong the circulation time of drug, PEGylation has been widely used via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby providing new hope for better treatment. However, PEGylation also brings the \"PEG dilemma\", which is difficult for the cellular absorption of drugs and subsequent endosomal escape. As a result, the activity of drugs is inevitably lost after PEG modification. To achieve successful drug delivery for effective treatment, the crucial issue associated with the use of PEG-lipids, that is, \"PEG dilemma\" must be addressed. In this paper, we introduced the development and application of nanocarriers with cleavable PEGylation, and discussed various strategies for overcoming the PEG dilemma. Compared to the traditional ones, the vehicle systems with different environmental-sensitive PEG-lipids were discussed, which cleavage can be achieved in response to the intracellular as well as the tumor microenvironment. This smart cleavable PEGylation provides us an efficient strategy to overcome \"PEG dilemma\", thereby may be a good candidate for the cancer treatment in future."

Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption (Tsakiri et al., 2021) and facilitate the BBB uptake process (Zhang et al., 2008)",

However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges (Fang et al., 2017)."

The physicochemical assay was held in water HPLC-grade and Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), in order to determine whether these systems can be used as drug or antigen delivery nanosystems. Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the \u03b6-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 25\u2009\u00b0C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability."

Adsorption of proteins could be influenced by chiral surfaces of nanoparticles; however, very few quantitative studies are available on the interaction of protein with the chiral surface of nanoparticles, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. We have developed a strategy to quantitatively analyze the adsorption and conformational features of transferrin on gold nanoparticles that are functionalized with d, l, and racemic penicillamine. We used a quartz microbalance platform to monitor the interaction of the adsorbed transferrin with transferrin receptors in HEK cell-derived liposomes. Results show that the chiral surface of nanoparticle determines the orientation and conformation of transferrin, which subsequently affects the interaction and recognition of transferrin with its receptor on the cellular membrane. Transferrin is widely used as a tumor-targeting ligand in cancer treatment and diagnosis since the transferrin receptor is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various types of cancer cells. Thus, the present results will help to expand the knowledge on biological identity of nanoparticles with chiral surfaces in a physiological environment and provide an insight into the rational design of therapeutic nanoparticles."

Interestingly, PEG often comprises the entire surface of polymersomes due to its incorporation into the block copolymer, while the degree of PEGylation for liposomes is limited to low molecular ratios (Photos et al., 2003). Consequently, the polymersome surface most likely constitutes of dense PEG chains in 'brush' conformation, which may result in a distinct biological identity compared to that of liposomes with PEG chains in a collapsed 'mushroom' state. Nevertheless, the biological identity of PEGbased polymersomes has not been fully elucidated yet and may also depend on interactions between physicochemical properties, including surface chemistry and functionalization."

Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications. Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive. Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70]",
