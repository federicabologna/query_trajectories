Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) remains a serious source of concern even with the availability of vaccines. Incomplete strain coverage is a limitation of current vaccines, hence efforts to identify candidate antigens that will compose supplementary or replacement vaccines are necessitated. In this proof-of-principle study, we sought to assess the applicability of RV 2.0 to anti-meningococcal vaccine antigen discovery. Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) obtained from a patient convalescing from serogroup B (MenB) IMD, were isolated and sorted singly using FACS.

Rappuoli, M. Bottomley, U. D\u2019Oro, O. Finco, E. De Gregorio\n## Abstract\nRappuoli et al. illustrate how new breakthroughs in the field of human immunology can be combined with insights from structural and computational biology for the rational design of novel broadly protective immunogens, potentiating the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases that still present an important unmet medical need.\n## body\nTraditionally, vaccines have been developed empirically by isolating, inactivating, and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them) that cause disease (Table 1; Rappuoli, 2014).Two decades ago, genome sequencing revolutionized this process, allowing for the discovery of novel vaccine antigens starting directly from genomic information.The process was named \"reverse vaccinology\" to underline that vaccine design was possible starting from sequence information without the need to grow pathogens (Rappuoli, 2000).Indeed, a vaccine against meningococcus B, the first deriving from reverse vaccinology, has recently been licensed (Serruto et al., 2012;O'Ryan et al., 2014).Today, a new wave of technologies in the fields of human immunology and structural biology provide the molecular information that allows for the discovery and design of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human CMV (HCMV) that have been impossible thus far and to propose universal vaccines to tackle influenza and HIV infections.Here, we provide our perspective (summarized in Table 1) of how several new advances, some of which have been partially discussed elsewhere (Burton, 2002;Dormitzer et al., 2012;Haynes et al., 2012), can be synergized to become the engine driving what might be considered a new era in vaccinology, an era in which we perform \"reverse vaccinology 2.0.\"\n\nSeveral technological breakthroughs over the past decade have potentiated vaccine design.First, the greatly enhanced ability to clone human B cells and then to produce the corresponding recombinant mAbs or antigen-binding fragments (Fab's) has provided access to an enormously rich set of reagents that allows for the proper evaluation of the protective human immune response to any given immunogen upon immunization or infection.A fundamental step for the success of this approach has been the growing capacity to select the most favorable donors for the isolation of the most potent antibodies (Abs) through extensive examination of serum-functional Ab responses.\n\n## Human B cell technologies to identify functional Abs against infectious diseases\nNearly all licensed vaccines confer protection against infectious diseases by stimulating the production of pathogen-specific Abs by B cells.Understanding the nature of a successful Ab response is therefore a fundamental step to providing new tools for the design of novel or better vaccines.The isolation and characterization of the Ab repertoire produced by antigen-specific B cells has acquired a central importance in the last decade to unravel the response to vaccine antigens.\n\nDissecting the basic mechanisms that define the dynamics of the Ab responses to vaccination and deepening the Traditionally, vaccines have been developed by cultivating infectious agents and isolating the inactivated whole pathogen or some of its purified components.20 years ago, reverse vaccinology enabled vaccine discovery and design based on information deriving from the sequence of microbial genomes rather than via the growth of pathogens.Today, the high throughput discovery of protective human antibodies, sequencing of the B cell repertoire, and the increasing structural characterization of protective antigens and epitopes provide the molecular and mechanistic understanding to drive the discovery of novel vaccines that were previously impossible.We are entering a \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" era.\n\nknowledge of the correlates of vaccine-induced protection or biological signatures of responsiveness are becoming fundamental in the development of novel vaccines.Both memory B cells (MBCs) and plasmablasts (peaking at day 8 after vaccination) have been used to generate naturally derived antigen-specific mAbs.MBCs were shown to be more suitable for this kind of application because of their capability to secrete Abs after EBV immortalization and in the presence of a TLR9 ligand and/or allogeneic irradiated mononuclear cells (Traggiai et al., 2004).Usually, total peripheral blood lymphocytes or sorted IgG + MBCs are cultured and the released Abs can be screened for antigen specificity and/or functionality.More recently, it has been discovered that even single plasmablasts can be cultured without immortalization, and they can produce sufficient amounts of Abs to allow screening for Ab specificity and function (Jin et al., 2009;Corti et al., 2011b).",

                    "text": "Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of several proteins with antigenic activity, using expression vectors such as bacteria or yeast. A well-known example of this application is the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) in Escherichia coli, which has led to the first recombinant protein-based vaccines reaching the market using alum as adjuvant (Engerix-B\u00ae from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Recombivax HB\u00ae from Merck & Co., Inc.). Similarly, antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV), expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Trichoplusia ni, are commercialised as Gardasil\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), with alum and AS04\u00ae (a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) as adjuvants, respectively. Other pathogens for which recombinant protein antigens have been identified and studied include hepatitis C and E and rotavirus (Ohtake and Arakawa, 2013). \n\nThe concept of \"reverse vaccinology\", focussed on the scan of the whole genome of the pathogen for identification of antigenic protein candidates, represented an important advance towards the development of new vaccines. This strategy has led to the development, for example, of a new meningococcal vaccine, commercialised in Europe under the brand name of Bexsero\u00ae (by Novartis Vaccines). Vaccines against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leishmania infantum, among others, have also been investigated using this approach (Donati and Rappuoli, 2013).",

Alonso, M. de la Fuente\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Recombinant proteins\nRecombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of several proteins with antigenic activity, using expression vectors such as bacteria or yeast. A well-known example of this application is the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) in Escherichia coli, which has led to the first recombinant protein-based vaccines reaching the market using alum as adjuvant (Engerix-B\u00ae from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Recombivax HB\u00ae from Merck & Co., Inc.). Similarly, antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV), expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Trichoplusia ni, are commercialised as Gardasil\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), with alum and AS04\u00ae (a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) as adjuvants, respectively. Other pathogens for which recombinant protein antigens have been identified and studied include hepatitis C and E and rotavirus (Ohtake and Arakawa, 2013). \n\nThe concept of \"reverse vaccinology\", focussed on the scan of the whole genome of the pathogen for identification of antigenic protein candidates, represented an important advance towards the development of new vaccines. This strategy has led to the development, for example, of a new meningococcal vaccine, commercialised in Europe under the brand name of Bexsero\u00ae (by Novartis Vaccines). Vaccines against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leishmania infantum, among others, have also been investigated using this approach (Donati and Rappuoli, 2013).",

Related peer-reviewed journal article searches were conducted using a subscribed database at the Universiti Putra Malaysia library, involving areas of Health Sciences and Medicine via Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. New generation vaccines include highly purified synthetic or recombinant antigens that stimulate effective cell-mediated immune and mucosal immunity. In order to enhance their efficacy, a number of adjuvants are used. Efforts have also been made to explore the usage of non-invasive routes of administration, devices and equipment for optimized antigen and immune-potentiator delivery of the immune system. Recombinant vaccine technology is rapid, compared to the traditional method of vaccine development and does not require the handling of live viruses. It is, therefore, a promising technology for developing a future vaccine to curb emerging and re-emerging viral infections that may be life-threatening or teratogenic.",

This technology provides the possibility of developing vaccines against difficult-to-culture or non-culturable viruses and eliminates safety risks by using bioprocesses that are more controlled with defined process components and a shorter process of production, which is very important in terms of responding to a pandemic [70,71]. A typical example of a recombinant vaccine is Recombivax, a hepatitis B recombinant DNA vaccine, which was the first to be licensed. In this vaccine, recombinant hepatitis surface antigen is expressed in a yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [25], in contrast to the original vaccine that was made by purifying HBV particles from infected blood [72]. Over the past decade, several new vaccines have been developed using recombinant technology. One common approach is reverse vaccinology, in which genome analysis is performed to identify a repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, surface exposed and conserved across multiple strains. \n\nThe most immunogenic epitopes are sequenced and evaluated for appropriateness for a vaccine formulation and then patented by a pharmaceutical company for commercialization. Recombinant vaccine technology will be key to future vaccine development considering the current outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral infections that are life-threatening and teratogenic, such as the Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. This is because the upstream process in recombinant vaccine technology is fast compared to cell culture and in egg production and does not require the handling of live virus and the accompanying expensive Biosafety containment equipment.",

Related peer-reviewed journal article searches were conducted using a subscribed database at the Universiti Putra Malaysia library, involving areas of Health Sciences and Medicine via Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. New generation vaccines include highly purified synthetic or recombinant antigens that stimulate effective cell-mediated immune and mucosal immunity. In order to enhance their efficacy, a number of adjuvants are used. Efforts have also been made to explore the usage of non-invasive routes of administration, devices and equipment for optimized antigen and immune-potentiator delivery of the immune system. Recombinant vaccine technology is rapid, compared to the traditional method of vaccine development and does not require the handling of live viruses. It is, therefore, a promising technology for developing a future vaccine to curb emerging and re-emerging viral infections that may be life-threatening or teratogenic.\n## Recombinant vaccine technology\nThis is a modern method of developing vaccines. It involves the recombinant expression of proteins and viral vectors. This technology provides the possibility of developing vaccines against difficult-to-culture or non-culturable viruses and eliminates safety risks by using bioprocesses that are more controlled with defined process components and a shorter process of production, which is very important in terms of responding to a pandemic [70,71]. A typical example of a recombinant vaccine is Recombivax, a hepatitis B recombinant DNA vaccine, which was the first to be licensed. In this vaccine, recombinant hepatitis surface antigen is expressed in a yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [25], in contrast to the original vaccine that was made by purifying HBV particles from infected blood [72]. Over the past decade, several new vaccines have been developed using recombinant technology. One common approach is reverse vaccinology, in which genome analysis is performed to identify a repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, surface exposed and conserved across multiple strains. \n\nThe most immunogenic epitopes are sequenced and evaluated for appropriateness for a vaccine formulation and then patented by a pharmaceutical company for commercialization. Recombinant vaccine technology will be key to future vaccine development considering the current outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral infections that are life-threatening and teratogenic, such as the Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. This is because the upstream process in recombinant vaccine technology is fast compared to cell culture and in egg production and does not require the handling of live virus and the accompanying expensive Biosafety containment equipment.",

Oh, Y. Choi, O. S. Shin\n## Abstract\nEmerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a major threat to public health and security. Given the dynamic nature and significant impact of EIDs, the most effective way to prevent and protect against them is to develop vaccines in advance. Systems biology approaches provide an integrative way to understand the complex immune response to pathogens. They can lead to a greater understanding of EID pathogenesis and facilitate the evaluation of newly developed vaccine-induced immunity in a timely manner. In recent years, advances in high throughput technologies have enabled researchers to successfully apply systems biology methods to analyze immune responses to a variety of pathogens and vaccines. Despite recent advances, computational and biological challenges impede wider application of systems biology approaches. This review highlights recent advances in the fields of systems immunology and vaccinology, and presents ways that systems biology-based platforms can be applied to accelerate a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immunity against EIDs.\n## REVERSE VACCINOLOGY-BASED VACCINE DESIGN\nEmerging technologies, such as structure-based antigen design and synthetic vaccinology, have heralded in a new era of vaccine discovery and development. As an example, a reverse vaccinology process was recently applied, based on the notion that protective antigens could be identified by determining the antibody repertoire from infected or vaccinated individuals. 89,90 Fig. 3 demonstrates the identification of novel and the most effective epitopes using NGS and high-throughput robotic crystallization platforms to enable more precise prediction of epitope targets for efficient antibody generation. Webbased epitope databases, vaccine design resources, and protein structure comparison resources can help to improve our understanding of immune responses and the escape and evolution of pathogens. 91 As an example, there have been massive antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. 92 Given the importance of neutralizing antibodies for vaccine protection, the dissection of antibody variable regions using reverse vaccinology tools is a rational approach to design vaccines and will ultimately lead to more effective vaccines for EIDs.\n\n## SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nRecent advances in systems biology-based technologies have enabled scientists to investigate the immune responses induced by pathogens and vaccines at a greater depth than ever before. More importantly, these advances are facilitating the identification of robust molecular and cellular signatures of protective immunity, which can help to generate diagnostic tools that reduce the length and cost of current clinical trials. The workflow of vaccine design using reverse vaccinology is shown. First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans. \n\nWhen these systems approaches are applied to EIDs, they will enable more rapid and rational design of vaccine development. Thus, in this developing field, vaccinologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and systems biologists must work hand-in-hand to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines induce protective immunity and help drive development of the next generation of vaccines to prevent EIDs.",

High-throughput antibody isolation approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the B cell responses elicited following infection and/or vaccination. Structure-based approaches have illuminated species-specific and cross-protective epitopes of therapeutic value.

                    "text": "The first generation of flavivirus vaccines, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine, were developed empirically by serially passaging pathogenic virus in animal tissues until attenuated virus variants emerged that were suitable to be used as a safe, live and effective vaccine (1,2). Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

Dussupt, K. Modjarrad, S. Krebs\n## Abstract\nThe unprecedented 2015\u20132016 Zika outbreak in the Americas sparked global concern and drove the rapid deployment of vaccine and therapeutic countermeasures against this re-emerging pathogen. Alongside vaccine development, a number of potent neutralizing antibodies against Zika and related flaviviruses have been identified in recent years. High-throughput antibody isolation approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the B cell responses elicited following infection and/or vaccination. Structure-based approaches have illuminated species-specific and cross-protective epitopes of therapeutic value. This review will highlight previously described monoclonal antibodies with the best therapeutic potential against ZIKV and related flaviviruses, and discuss their implications for the rational design of better vaccine strategies.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe first generation of flavivirus vaccines, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine, were developed empirically by serially passaging pathogenic virus in animal tissues until attenuated virus variants emerged that were suitable to be used as a safe, live and effective vaccine (1,2). Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

Although multiple doses of the same vaccine are typically required to reach an adequate level of protection, it would be advantageous to develop vaccines that induce protective immunity with fewer doses, ideally just one. Single-dose vaccines would be ideal to maximize vaccination coverage, help stakeholders to greatly reduce the costs associated with vaccination, and improve patient convenience. Here we describe past attempts to develop potent single dose vaccines and explore the reasons they failed. Then, we review key immunological mechanisms of the vaccine-specific immune responses, and how innovative technologies and approaches are guiding the preclinical and clinical development of potent single-dose vaccines. By modulating the spatio-temporal delivery of the vaccine components, by providing the appropriate stimuli to the innate immunity, and by designing better antigens, the new technologies and approaches leverage our current knowledge of the immune system and may synergize to enable the rational design of next-generation vaccination strategies. This review provides a rational perspective on the possible development of future single-dose vaccines.",

                    "text": "The design of optimal vaccination strategies begins with the selection of the right antigen. In the past, vaccine antigens were typically selected through an empirical approach in which the pathogen (or a component of it) was isolated, inactivated and injected to induce protective immunity; many vaccines in use today have been developed with this empirical approach. In the last two decades a new and rational approach, named reverse vaccinology 48 , has enabled the development of new vaccines for which an empirical approach had not been successful, including a licensed vaccine against serogroup B meningococcus and many others are in clinical development 48,49 . By combining the most advanced technologies in genome sequencing, proteomics and bioinformatics, the reverse vaccinology approach has provided a framework to select the right vaccine antigens starting from the pathogen's genome. Reverse vaccinology has pioneered new ways of thinking about vaccine development, including a new structural vaccinology approach, and represents a milestone in the history of vaccinology 50,51 . \n\nStructure-based antigen design, also known as structural vaccinology, is today a key driving force in vaccine innovation 48,49,52 . It relies on bioinformatics and computational tools to design optimized protein antigens for an efficient display of protective epitopes to B cells. The structural vaccinology approach has been used in at least three new vaccine design strategies. One strategy aims to stabilize proteins or polypeptides in a protective antibody-inducing conformation, typically a conformation that is not very stable by itself, but it can be stabilized by modifying the sequence of the protein; this approach has led to the development of an RSV candidate vaccine and is helping in the development of the first universal influenza vaccine and HIV vaccine [53][54][55] . A second approach aims to merge multiple variants of the same protective epitope into a single chimeric protein or polypeptide chain; such approach has been successful to provide vaccine candidates including Factor H binding protein (FHbp) from serogroup B meningococcus and the backbone protein of pilus from serogroup B streptococcus 52,56 .",

Mallett, S. Bertholet, D. O\u2019hagan\n## Abstract\nVaccines represent the most successful medical intervention in history, with billions of lives saved. Although multiple doses of the same vaccine are typically required to reach an adequate level of protection, it would be advantageous to develop vaccines that induce protective immunity with fewer doses, ideally just one. Single-dose vaccines would be ideal to maximize vaccination coverage, help stakeholders to greatly reduce the costs associated with vaccination, and improve patient convenience. Here we describe past attempts to develop potent single dose vaccines and explore the reasons they failed. Then, we review key immunological mechanisms of the vaccine-specific immune responses, and how innovative technologies and approaches are guiding the preclinical and clinical development of potent single-dose vaccines. By modulating the spatio-temporal delivery of the vaccine components, by providing the appropriate stimuli to the innate immunity, and by designing better antigens, the new technologies and approaches leverage our current knowledge of the immune system and may synergize to enable the rational design of next-generation vaccination strategies. This review provides a rational perspective on the possible development of future single-dose vaccines.\n## BETTER ANTIGEN DESIGN\nThe design of optimal vaccination strategies begins with the selection of the right antigen. In the past, vaccine antigens were typically selected through an empirical approach in which the pathogen (or a component of it) was isolated, inactivated and injected to induce protective immunity; many vaccines in use today have been developed with this empirical approach. In the last two decades a new and rational approach, named reverse vaccinology 48 , has enabled the development of new vaccines for which an empirical approach had not been successful, including a licensed vaccine against serogroup B meningococcus and many others are in clinical development 48,49 . By combining the most advanced technologies in genome sequencing, proteomics and bioinformatics, the reverse vaccinology approach has provided a framework to select the right vaccine antigens starting from the pathogen's genome. Reverse vaccinology has pioneered new ways of thinking about vaccine development, including a new structural vaccinology approach, and represents a milestone in the history of vaccinology 50,51 . \n\nStructure-based antigen design, also known as structural vaccinology, is today a key driving force in vaccine innovation 48,49,52 . It relies on bioinformatics and computational tools to design optimized protein antigens for an efficient display of protective epitopes to B cells. The structural vaccinology approach has been used in at least three new vaccine design strategies. One strategy aims to stabilize proteins or polypeptides in a protective antibody-inducing conformation, typically a conformation that is not very stable by itself, but it can be stabilized by modifying the sequence of the protein; this approach has led to the development of an RSV candidate vaccine and is helping in the development of the first universal influenza vaccine and HIV vaccine [53][54][55] . A second approach aims to merge multiple variants of the same protective epitope into a single chimeric protein or polypeptide chain; such approach has been successful to provide vaccine candidates including Factor H binding protein (FHbp) from serogroup B meningococcus and the backbone protein of pilus from serogroup B streptococcus 52,56 .",

In the wider context of the experimental discovery of vaccine antigens, with particular reference to reverse vaccinology, this chapter adumbrates the principal computational approaches currently deployed in the hunt for novel antigens: genome-level prediction of antigens, antigen identification through the use of protein sequence alignment-based approaches, antigen detection through the use of subcellular location prediction, and the use of alignment-independent approaches to antigen discovery. Reference is also made to the recent emergence of various expert systems for protein antigen identification.\n## Reverse Vaccinology and the Experimental Identification of Antigens\nThus, a considerable number of potential, putative, and possible vaccine candidate antigens could be missed by conventional experimental approaches. Reverse vaccinology [16][17][18][19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology was originally established and has been established by studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. Vaccines are currently available for all serotypes, except that serogroup B.

Apostolopoulos\n## Abstract\nSeveral modes of vaccine delivery have been developed in the last 25 years, which induce strong immune responses in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials. Some modes of delivery include, adjuvants (aluminum hydroxide, Ribi formulation, QS21), liposomes, nanoparticles, virus like particles, immunostimulatory complexes (ISCOMs), dendrimers, viral vectors, DNA delivery via gene gun, electroporation or Biojector 2000, cell penetrating peptides, dendritic cell receptor targeting, toll-like receptors, chemokine receptors and bacterial toxins. There is an enormous amount of information and vaccine delivery methods available for guiding vaccine and immunotherapeutics development against diseases.\n## Technologies Used in the Generation of New Improved Vaccines\nThe application of genetic and recombinant DNA approaches to vaccination has led to new possibilities of safer and more efficient vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology can be applied to antigen identification and isolation, and by being able to clone and express all the antigens of an organism individually, overcomes two major hurdles associated with traditional vaccines. First, before the recombinant DNA era, it was difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of particular antigens in a pure enough form to allow the appropriate testing. Recombinant DNA technology overcame this problem, and second, recombinant DNA technology has made the study of pathogenic organisms safer because single genes and their translation products are examined rather than the whole organism [1][2][3].\n\nSynthetic peptide chemistry has greatly contributed to vaccinology, where peptides (2-100 amino acids) could be synthesized and used as immunogens, in addition to synthesizing T and B cell epitopes and used as vaccines. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography approaches in understanding protein structures has contributed enormously into the generation of improved vaccines. Numerous peptide based vaccines have been shown effective in pre-clinical and in human clinical trials [4][5][6][7]. The advent of these technologies stimulated the production of new vaccines and the identification of precise epitopes on antigens has made synthetic peptide vaccines a real possibility. Such vaccines are designed to be safer and more efficient. Unfortunately, there are still many obstacles for their clinical use; the limited immunogenicity of many of these candidates has hindered their development as potential vaccines. Strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines are therefore required.\n...\nThe application of genetic and recombinant DNA approaches to vaccination has led to new possibilities of safer and more efficient vaccines.

In this brief research report, we will outline findings relating to the following aims: (i) whether cross-reactive antimeningococcal hmAbs targeting surface proteins could be cloned from patient samples; and (ii) if these hmAbs possessed bactericidal activity against a wide panel of strains, specifically those not covered by the protein-based meningococcal vaccines.

Severe forms tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly, since their immune competence is eroded by immaturity and immune senescence, respectively. The main etiologic agents differ according to patient age and geographic area. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) are the most important pathogens in children, whereas influenza viruses are the leading cause of fatal pneumonia in the elderly. Effective vaccines are available against some of these organisms. However, there are still many agents against which vaccines are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal. To tackle this problem, empiric approaches are now being systematically replaced by rational vaccine design. This is facilitated by the growing knowledge in the fields of immunology, microbial pathogenesis and host response to infection, as well as by the availability of sophisticated strategies for antigen selection, potent immune modulators and efficient antigen delivery systems. Thus, a new generation of vaccines with improved safety and efficacy profiles compared to old and new agents is emerging.

In addition, vaccine development for people with compromised immunity and other pre-existing medical conditions has remained a major challenge. Besides the traditional inactivated or live attenuated, virus-vectored and subunit vaccines, emerging non-viral vaccine technologies, such as viral-like particle and nanoparticle vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, and rational vaccine design, offer innovative approaches to address existing challenges of vaccine development. They have also significantly advanced our understanding of vaccine immunology and can guide future vaccine development for many diseases, including rapidly emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and diseases that have not traditionally been addressed by vaccination, such as cancers and substance abuse. This review provides an integrative discussion of new non-viral vaccine development technologies and their use to address the most fundamental and ongoing challenges of vaccine development.",

Whereas traditional vaccines are generally developed through attenuation or inactivation of pathogens and through the incorporation of few selected antigens as vaccine components, new technologies have recently been applied toward antigen discovery and design. For example, \"reverse vaccinology\" refers to the ability to screen the complete antigen sets based on whole-genome sequencing of pathogens for the ability to induce protective antibody responses. Combinations of reverse vaccinology and traditional vaccine approaches allow for an efficient development of immunogenic vaccine candidates (74,75). \n\nBioinformatic tools have contributed greatly to vaccine design and evaluation in recent years. Computational approaches are continually improving in their ability to predict T and B-cell epitopes from the complete antigen pools and to rationally design antigens with potential long-lasting protective immunity. Such algorithms calculate antigen-antibody interaction energies and structures (76) that increasingly bridge modeling based on existing templates and free-modeling based on heterologous structures and database consensus design (77). Deep sequencing combined with computational analysis allows for thoroughly characterizing the B cell repertoire in survivors of disease to identify the protective immunity (78). \n\nA computationally designed antigen found to be protective in animal models was first reported for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F antigen in 2013 (79). Many challenging vaccine targets have since been developed rationally for HIV (80)(81)(82), hepatitis C (83,84), herpes (85), Zika (86,87), RSV (82), HPV (88), as well as for bacteria (82,89), fungi (90), and cancers (91). Rational vaccine design has also been utilized to improve VLP and NP vaccines by selecting a repetitive and predictive protein backbone structure for enhanced antigen presentation (92). Finally, rational antigen design is being explored for activation of dendritic cells (93) such as targeting C-type lectin receptors to activate antigen presentation in the context of the pathogens (e.g., Ebola and HIV) (94).",

Vrba, Natalie M Kirk, Yuying Liang, H. Ly\n## Abstract\nDespite the success of vaccination to greatly mitigate or eliminate threat of diseases caused by pathogens, there are still known diseases and emerging pathogens for which the development of successful vaccines against them is inherently difficult. In addition, vaccine development for people with compromised immunity and other pre-existing medical conditions has remained a major challenge. Besides the traditional inactivated or live attenuated, virus-vectored and subunit vaccines, emerging non-viral vaccine technologies, such as viral-like particle and nanoparticle vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, and rational vaccine design, offer innovative approaches to address existing challenges of vaccine development. They have also significantly advanced our understanding of vaccine immunology and can guide future vaccine development for many diseases, including rapidly emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and diseases that have not traditionally been addressed by vaccination, such as cancers and substance abuse. This review provides an integrative discussion of new non-viral vaccine development technologies and their use to address the most fundamental and ongoing challenges of vaccine development.\n## Rationally Designed Vaccines\nA key aspect of non-viral vaccine development involves the selection of antigens that can effectively elicit a protective immune response. Whereas traditional vaccines are generally developed through attenuation or inactivation of pathogens and through the incorporation of few selected antigens as vaccine components, new technologies have recently been applied toward antigen discovery and design. For example, \"reverse vaccinology\" refers to the ability to screen the complete antigen sets based on whole-genome sequencing of pathogens for the ability to induce protective antibody responses. Combinations of reverse vaccinology and traditional vaccine approaches allow for an efficient development of immunogenic vaccine candidates (74,75). \n\nBioinformatic tools have contributed greatly to vaccine design and evaluation in recent years. Computational approaches are continually improving in their ability to predict T and B-cell epitopes from the complete antigen pools and to rationally design antigens with potential long-lasting protective immunity. Such algorithms calculate antigen-antibody interaction energies and structures (76) that increasingly bridge modeling based on existing templates and free-modeling based on heterologous structures and database consensus design (77). Deep sequencing combined with computational analysis allows for thoroughly characterizing the B cell repertoire in survivors of disease to identify the protective immunity (78). \n\nA computationally designed antigen found to be protective in animal models was first reported for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F antigen in 2013 (79). Many challenging vaccine targets have since been developed rationally for HIV (80)(81)(82), hepatitis C (83,84), herpes (85), Zika (86,87), RSV (82), HPV (88), as well as for bacteria (82,89), fungi (90), and cancers (91). Rational vaccine design has also been utilized to improve VLP and NP vaccines by selecting a repetitive and predictive protein backbone structure for enhanced antigen presentation (92). Finally, rational antigen design is being explored for activation of dendritic cells (93) such as targeting C-type lectin receptors to activate antigen presentation in the context of the pathogens (e.g., Ebola and HIV) (94).",

Early vaccines were developed empirically however, rational design of vaccines can allow us to optimise their efficacy, by tailoring the immune response. Establishing the immune correlates of protection greatly informs the rational design of vaccines. This facilitates the selection of the best vaccine antigens and the most appropriate vaccine adjuvant to generate optimal memory immune T cell and B cell responses. This review outlines the range of vaccine types that are currently authorised and those under development. We outline the optimal immunological correlates of protection that can be targeted. Finally we review approaches to rational antigen selection and rational vaccine adjuvant design. Harnessing current knowledge on protective immune responses in combination with critical vaccine components is imperative to the prevention of future life-threatening diseases.\n## Subunit Protein and Peptide Protein and Polysaccharide Vaccines\nSeveral strategies have been devised to identify novel vaccine antigens.

It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) [194][195][196][197]. Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity [197][198][199][200][201][202]. Recombinant expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. \n\nProteomes 2016, 4, 11 12 of 24 expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. With the intention of further reducing the number of microbial antigens to be examined, computer aided selection tools have been developed that draw on available information about successful vaccine antigens to deduce common features, such as chemical properties of amino acid sequences [203] or functional domains [204], and apply this knowledge to the discovery of vaccine candidates in microbial genome databases. The latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204].",

Instead of starting with the whole bacterial genome, they selected ten conserved surface exposed proteins for antigenicity testing and identified epitopes from fibronectin binding protein A (FnbpA), collagen adhesion (Cna), serine-rich adhesin for platelets (SraP) and elastine binding protein (EbpS) as putative targets. These, however, still need to be validated [205]. In empirical vaccinology, infection-relevant S. aureus antigens can be comprehensively mapped using transcriptomics and proteomics. In parallel, immunoproteomics provides a panoramic view of the intensity and dynamics of antibody binding to S. aureus proteins revealing their immunogenicity. Moreover, omics technologies can aid the characterization of the T-cell response to S. aureus in its full complexity. These empirical approaches will lead to the discovery of promising S. aureus vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology is a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens. First, the whole S. aureus genome is mined for potential B-and T-cell epitopes using computer-based algorithms. Next, candidate antigens are produced as recombinant proteins and purified. These antigens as well as those that have been identified empirically are then used for vaccination in pre-clinical infection models and assayed for their ability to mediate protection. Promising candidate vaccines will then be subjected to clinical trials (not shown). Hence, omics technologies are versatile tools empowering both empirical and in-silico-based vaccine development.",

Omics technologies promise to speed up vaccine development by enabling reverse vaccinology approaches. In consequence, omics technologies are powerful tools for deepening our understanding of the \u201csuperbug\u201d S. aureus and for improving its control.\n## Omics Technologies in S. aureus Vaccine Development\nThe omics revolution, including novel bioinformatics tools for data analysis, has extended the options in vaccine research beyond empirical strategies, promising to speed up vaccine development. It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) [194][195][196][197]. Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity [197][198][199][200][201][202]. Recombinant expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. \n\nProteomes 2016, 4, 11 12 of 24 expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. With the intention of further reducing the number of microbial antigens to be examined, computer aided selection tools have been developed that draw on available information about successful vaccine antigens to deduce common features, such as chemical properties of amino acid sequences [203] or functional domains [204], and apply this knowledge to the discovery of vaccine candidates in microbial genome databases. The latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204].\n...\nThe latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204]. \n\nIn a pilot study, Oprea et al. employed a simplified reverse vaccinology approach to identify S. aureus candidate epitopes that induce both B-and T-cell mediated immunity [205]. Instead of starting with the whole bacterial genome, they selected ten conserved surface exposed proteins for antigenicity testing and identified epitopes from fibronectin binding protein A (FnbpA), collagen adhesion (Cna), serine-rich adhesin for platelets (SraP) and elastine binding protein (EbpS) as putative targets. These, however, still need to be validated [205]. In empirical vaccinology, infection-relevant S. aureus antigens can be comprehensively mapped using transcriptomics and proteomics. In parallel, immunoproteomics provides a panoramic view of the intensity and dynamics of antibody binding to S. aureus proteins revealing their immunogenicity. Moreover, omics technologies can aid the characterization of the T-cell response to S. aureus in its full complexity. These empirical approaches will lead to the discovery of promising S. aureus vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology is a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens. First, the whole S. aureus genome is mined for potential B-and T-cell epitopes using computer-based algorithms. Next, candidate antigens are produced as recombinant proteins and purified. These antigens as well as those that have been identified empirically are then used for vaccination in pre-clinical infection models and assayed for their ability to mediate protection. Promising candidate vaccines will then be subjected to clinical trials (not shown). Hence, omics technologies are versatile tools empowering both empirical and in-silico-based vaccine development.",

Four of these technologies are briefly described below. \n\nAntigenome technology -The Antigenome approach, proposed by Etz and co-workers, 2 stems from the assumption, experimentally confirmed to be basically true for antibodymediated immunity, that all protective antigens induce antibodies during natural infection. On the basis of that, the genomic DNA of the pathogen of interest is fragmented and the fragments are cloned to create bacterial expression libraries, each clone expressing random portions of the pathogen proteins. Those clones expressing immunogenic proteins are then identified by immunoassays using sera from convalescent patients. Normally, from a bacterial pathogen, 40 to 50 immunogenic proteins are identified and these proteins are subsequently tested in appropriate surrogate-of-protection assays (SoPAs) to select those to be used as vaccines. \n\nGenome (\"Reverse Vaccinology\") technologies -Differently from the previous approach, this technology is completely \"unbiased\" and originates from the indisputable assumption that protective proteins must be encoded by the genetic makeup. Therefore, the genome of the pathogen of interest is sequenced and all annotated proteins are expressed and purified to be finally tested in SoPAs. The approach was conceptualized for the first time by Stephen Johnson and coworkers using DNA immunization, 3 subsequently proposed using protein immunization by L. Lissolo and coworkers (Abstracts WHO Conference 'Utilization of genomic information for tropical disease drug and vaccine discovery', Geneva, 1998; 4 ), and finally demonstrated to be effective by Pizza and coworkers. 5 A Neisseria meningitidis Group B vaccine based on antigens (and Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), see below) selected by Reverse Vaccinology has recently been registered in Europe. 6 One interesting aspect of this approach is that it can also be applied for the identification of antigens that stimulate Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). 7 roteomic technologies -The main drawback of genome technologies is that several hundreds of recombinant proteins have to be screened in time-consuming and labor intensive assays usually involving animal models.",

Four of these technologies are briefly described below. \n\nAntigenome technology -The Antigenome approach, proposed by Etz and co-workers, 2 stems from the assumption, experimentally confirmed to be basically true for antibodymediated immunity, that all protective antigens induce antibodies during natural infection. On the basis of that, the genomic DNA of the pathogen of interest is fragmented and the fragments are cloned to create bacterial expression libraries, each clone expressing random portions of the pathogen proteins. Those clones expressing immunogenic proteins are then identified by immunoassays using sera from convalescent patients. Normally, from a bacterial pathogen, 40 to 50 immunogenic proteins are identified and these proteins are subsequently tested in appropriate surrogate-of-protection assays (SoPAs) to select those to be used as vaccines. \n\nGenome (\"Reverse Vaccinology\") technologies -Differently from the previous approach, this technology is completely \"unbiased\" and originates from the indisputable assumption that protective proteins must be encoded by the genetic makeup. Therefore, the genome of the pathogen of interest is sequenced and all annotated proteins are expressed and purified to be finally tested in SoPAs. The approach was conceptualized for the first time by Stephen Johnson and coworkers using DNA immunization, 3 subsequently proposed using protein immunization by L. Lissolo and coworkers (Abstracts WHO Conference 'Utilization of genomic information for tropical disease drug and vaccine discovery', Geneva, 1998; 4 ), and finally demonstrated to be effective by Pizza and coworkers. 5 A Neisseria meningitidis Group B vaccine based on antigens (and Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), see below) selected by Reverse Vaccinology has recently been registered in Europe. 6 One interesting aspect of this approach is that it can also be applied for the identification of antigens that stimulate Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). 7 roteomic technologies -The main drawback of genome technologies is that several hundreds of recombinant proteins have to be screened in time-consuming and labor intensive assays usually involving animal models.",

                    "text": "The biophysical, biochemical, and genetic engineering technologies needed for structural vaccinology are sophisticated, but the concept is simple: first, study the native molecular architecture of neutralization determinants; and then, use this knowledge to modify the molecules and engineer immunogens that are optimally designed for inclusion in protective vaccines. Success of structural vaccinology will require the application of high throughput methods to generate a large number of antigenic structures and assays to predict their effectiveness as immunogens. With current knowledge, we can already optimize protein antigens for efficient production, conformational homogeneity, and stable storage. However, fully realizing the potential of structure based design of vaccine antigens will require longer-term basic research into the structural determinants of immunodominance and immunogenicity. This research must take into account the diversity of the antibody repertoire generated not only in a single individual, but also in those of different genetic backgrounds and histories of antigen exposure. New techniques, such sorting IgG + antibody secreting plasma cells to rapidly clone human monoclonal antibodies specific for a recent immunogen [69], make such analyses feasible. \n\nThe application of structural insight to vaccine design is especially important for new vaccines against viral pathogens. The greater number of protective determinants of bacteria, fungi, and parasites make them suitable for a reverse vaccinology approach to discovering protective determinants with favorable vaccine antigen characteristics [6]. The limited number of protective determinants on most viruses necessitates optimizing a relatively small set of macromolecules. Antigen optimization is not limited to subunit vaccines. Live attenuated, vectored, and viruslike-particle vaccines could also incorporate antigens that have been optimized based on structural insights. Matching the rational design of antigens to advances in the rational design of adjuvants can enable a new generation of vaccines that are more safe, broadly protective, practical, and affordable than those available today.",

                    "text": "The use of native antigens has proven remarkably successful against a wide range of pathogens, but not against all agents for which vaccines are needed. The pathogens for which we have successful vaccines share certain characteristics. They are, in general, agents against which humoral immunity is protective, and their surface antigens do not vary more quickly than new variants can be incorporated into updated vaccines. Examples include diphtheria, poliovirus, and hepatitis B virus, which have not undergone significant antigenic change over many decades [5]. \n\nThe pathogens against which traditional techniques have not been successful also share certain characteristics. One of these characteristics is a lack of highly expressed surface antigens that are suitable for use as vaccine components. For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity [6]. Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus [7] and group B streptococcus [8]. Reverse vaccinology vaccine candidates for Staphylococcus aureus [9] and meningococcus B [10,11] are now in clinical trials. \n\nVaccines against the most refractory pathogens will require different solutions. For example, most viruses do not encode as-yet undiscovered protective antigens. HIV and hepatitis C virus vary their surface antigens so rapidly and extensively that antibodies elicited by their envelope glycoproteins can only neutralize strains that are closely related to strains from which the immunogens are derived. Furthermore, the immune response against the determinants of certain viral agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus or dengue virus, can actually exacerbate disease [12,13]. Protecting against new targets faces practical challenges as well.",

Ulmer, R. Rappuoli\n## Abstract\nNone\n## The need for structural vaccinology\nThe use of native antigens has proven remarkably successful against a wide range of pathogens, but not against all agents for which vaccines are needed. The pathogens for which we have successful vaccines share certain characteristics. They are, in general, agents against which humoral immunity is protective, and their surface antigens do not vary more quickly than new variants can be incorporated into updated vaccines. Examples include diphtheria, poliovirus, and hepatitis B virus, which have not undergone significant antigenic change over many decades [5]. \n\nThe pathogens against which traditional techniques have not been successful also share certain characteristics. One of these characteristics is a lack of highly expressed surface antigens that are suitable for use as vaccine components. For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity [6]. Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus [7] and group B streptococcus [8]. Reverse vaccinology vaccine candidates for Staphylococcus aureus [9] and meningococcus B [10,11] are now in clinical trials. \n\nVaccines against the most refractory pathogens will require different solutions. For example, most viruses do not encode as-yet undiscovered protective antigens. HIV and hepatitis C virus vary their surface antigens so rapidly and extensively that antibodies elicited by their envelope glycoproteins can only neutralize strains that are closely related to strains from which the immunogens are derived. Furthermore, the immune response against the determinants of certain viral agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus or dengue virus, can actually exacerbate disease [12,13]. Protecting against new targets faces practical challenges as well.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nThe biophysical, biochemical, and genetic engineering technologies needed for structural vaccinology are sophisticated, but the concept is simple: first, study the native molecular architecture of neutralization determinants; and then, use this knowledge to modify the molecules and engineer immunogens that are optimally designed for inclusion in protective vaccines. Success of structural vaccinology will require the application of high throughput methods to generate a large number of antigenic structures and assays to predict their effectiveness as immunogens. With current knowledge, we can already optimize protein antigens for efficient production, conformational homogeneity, and stable storage. However, fully realizing the potential of structure based design of vaccine antigens will require longer-term basic research into the structural determinants of immunodominance and immunogenicity. This research must take into account the diversity of the antibody repertoire generated not only in a single individual, but also in those of different genetic backgrounds and histories of antigen exposure. New techniques, such sorting IgG + antibody secreting plasma cells to rapidly clone human monoclonal antibodies specific for a recent immunogen [69], make such analyses feasible. \n\nThe application of structural insight to vaccine design is especially important for new vaccines against viral pathogens. The greater number of protective determinants of bacteria, fungi, and parasites make them suitable for a reverse vaccinology approach to discovering protective determinants with favorable vaccine antigen characteristics [6]. The limited number of protective determinants on most viruses necessitates optimizing a relatively small set of macromolecules. Antigen optimization is not limited to subunit vaccines. Live attenuated, vectored, and viruslike-particle vaccines could also incorporate antigens that have been optimized based on structural insights. Matching the rational design of antigens to advances in the rational design of adjuvants can enable a new generation of vaccines that are more safe, broadly protective, practical, and affordable than those available today.",

Hybridoma technology opened a new horizon in the production of antibodies against target antigens of infectious pathogens, malignant diseases including autoimmune disorders, and numerous potent toxins. However, these clinical humanized or chimeric murine antibodies have several limitations and complexities. Therefore, to overcome these difficulties, recent advances in genetic engineering techniques and phage display technique have allowed the production of highly specific recombinant antibodies. These engineered antibodies have been constructed in the hunt for novel therapeutic drugs equipped with enhanced immunoprotective abilities, such as engaging immune effector functions, effective development of fusion proteins, efficient tumor and tissue penetration, and high-affinity antibodies directed against conserved targets. Advanced antibody engineering techniques have extensive applications in the fields of immunology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutic medicines. However, there is limited knowledge regarding dynamic antibody development approaches. Therefore, this review extends beyond our understanding of conventional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, recent advances in antibody engineering techniques together with antibody fragments, display technologies, immunomodulation, and broad applications of antibodies are discussed to enhance innovative antibody production in pursuit of a healthier future for humans.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn the past few decades, antibodies have been developed by using conventional techniques such as hybridomas with significant applications in therapeutics. However, more recently, there have been advancements in recombinant technologies that have enhanced the generation of efficient immunoglobulins and their fragments. Antibody engineering offers rapid, costeffective, and efficient biomedical tools for the discovery of high-affinity peptides/proteins, investigation of protein-protein interactions, receptor binding, and epitope identification. This powerful technology is used in a variety of systems to approach different questions from a background of cell biology and biotechnology. Moreover, it is used for the production of different types of engineered antibodies against any target molecule or highly unique conserved antigens. Additionally, it is facilitating in diagnosis and treatment of infections to improve human health. Antibody engineering possesses broad spectrum of biological, biotechnological, medical, and antibody applications for the development of novel therapeutics in various disease fields. Numerous novel therapeutic drugs have been developed by in vitro screening and selection techniques based on several high throughput immune effector functions, engineered antibodies, and high-affinity antibody fragments. This review has comprehensively described hybridoma technology, advances in antibody engineering techniques, engineered antibodies, antibody fragments, display technologies, and applications of antibodies. In conclusion, the study will help in understanding the significance of antibody fabrication approaches with extensive uses in molecular, immunological, diagnostic, imaging, biomedical, and biotechnological fields, pursuing a healthier future for humans.",

            "abstract": "The development of a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101) vaccine remains a formidable challenge. An effective vaccine likely requires the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which likely involves the use of native\u2010like HIV\u20101 envelope (Env) trimers at some or all stages of vaccination. Development of such trimers has been very difficult, but much progress has been made in the past decade, starting with the BG505 SOSIP trimer, elucidation of its atomic structure and implementing subsequent design iterations.

The implication is that one bNAb specificity will most likely not be enough to induce broad protection, and an effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to induce multiple neutralizing specificities. \n\nEnv protein structures are playing an increasingly important role in vaccine design efforts. Resolving protein structures at the atomic level is necessary to define the surfaces that are accessible for the immune system, to determine sites that are targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), to design immunogens that mimic the proteins found on viral surfaces and to stabilize the desirable conformations [24]. This approach follows from \"reverse vaccinology\" in which complete genome sequencing of a pathogen is used to select for surfaceexpressed proteins to be used in a vaccine [25]. The term \"reverse vaccinology\" was repurposed in 2002 to describe the utilization of antibodies to select or design antigens with the appropriate binding properties [26]. A next iteration, \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" involves the use of antibodies and highresolution structures for the design of vaccine antigens [27]. \n\nWhile these concepts are widely applied in the HIV-1 vaccine design field, such structure-based vaccine design approaches also accelerated the development of novel vaccines against other pathogens. An example includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for which vaccine development was accelerated when the crystal structure of the pre-fusion F glycoprotein was resolved, using the D25 neutralizing antibody (NAb) specific for the pre-fusion form [28,29]. Similar to HIV-1 Env and other class I viral fusion proteins, the RSV F glycoprotein is very unstable and transitions very easily to its postfusion conformation. The apex targeting D25 MAb stabilized the F glycoprotein in its pre-fusion conformation, resulting in the high-resolution pre-fusion structure of the protein. This structure allowed for the development of a recombinant prefusion-stabilized F glycoprotein [24,28].",

Derking, R. Sanders\n## Abstract\nThe development of a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101) vaccine remains a formidable challenge. An effective vaccine likely requires the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which likely involves the use of native\u2010like HIV\u20101 envelope (Env) trimers at some or all stages of vaccination. Development of such trimers has been very difficult, but much progress has been made in the past decade, starting with the BG505 SOSIP trimer, elucidation of its atomic structure and implementing subsequent design iterations. This progress facilitated understanding the weaknesses of the Env trimer, fuelled structure\u2010guided HIV\u20101 vaccine design and assisted in the development of new vaccine designs. This review summarizes the relevant literature focusing on studies using structural biology to reveal and define HIV\u20101 Env sites of vulnerability; to improve Env trimers, by creating more stable versions; understanding antibody responses in preclinical vaccination studies at the atomic level; understanding the glycan shield; and to improve \u201con\u2010target\u201d antibody responses versus \u201coff\u2010target\u201d responses.\n## I N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe outcome of the trials was that VRC01 was not able to protect against HIV-1 acquisition overall, but did result in a sieving of VRC01-resistant viruses, suggesting that VRC01 was able to prevent transmission of VRC01sensitive viruses. The implication is that one bNAb specificity will most likely not be enough to induce broad protection, and an effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to induce multiple neutralizing specificities. \n\nEnv protein structures are playing an increasingly important role in vaccine design efforts. Resolving protein structures at the atomic level is necessary to define the surfaces that are accessible for the immune system, to determine sites that are targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), to design immunogens that mimic the proteins found on viral surfaces and to stabilize the desirable conformations [24].

Micheli, Paolo Milazzo, Giuseppe Maccari, Giorgio Ciano, Dario Cardamone, D. Medini\n## Abstract\nAbstract Deep learning has achieved impressive results in various fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, making it a powerful tool in biology. Its applications now encompass cellular image classification, genomic studies and drug discovery. While drug development traditionally focused deep learning applications on small molecules, recent innovations have incorporated it in the discovery and development of biological molecules, particularly antibodies. Researchers have devised novel techniques to streamline antibody development, combining in vitro and in silico methods. In particular, computational power expedites lead candidate generation, scaling and potential antibody development against complex antigens. This survey highlights significant advancements in protein design and optimization, specifically focusing on antibodies. This includes various aspects such as design, folding, antibody\u2013antigen interactions docking and affinity maturation.\n## Traditional techniques for antibody development\nIn the field of antibody development, conventional experimental approaches have long served as the foundation for the discovery and engineering of therapeutic antibodies.These methods involve techniques such as immunization and directed evolution through phage or yeast display [19,23,24].Specifically, in the realm of vaccine development, vaccines and antibodies were traditionally developed by isolating and inactivating disease-causing microorganisms or their components [51].The advent of genome sequencing enabled the discovery of new antigens directly from genomic information, leading to the concept of reverse vaccinology [51].Recently, advancements in human immunology and structural biology have led to a new approach known as reverse vaccinology 2.0, enabling high-throughput screening of antibodysecreting cells (ASCs) to obtain neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for prophylaxis or treatment [51].",

Furthermore, antibody engineering can be used to strengthen effector function and prolong mAb half-life, and advances in structural biology have enabled the selection and optimization of potent neutralizing mAbs through identification of vulnerable regions in viral proteins, which can also be relevant for vaccine design. The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated extensive efforts to develop neutralizing mAbs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with several mAbs now having received authorization for emergency use, providing not just an important component of strategies to combat COVID-19 but also a boost to efforts to harness mAbs in therapeutic and preventive settings for other infectious diseases. Here, we describe advances in antibody discovery and engineering that have led to the development of mAbs for use against infections caused by viruses including SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola virus (EBOV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and influenza. We also discuss the rationale for moving from empirical to structure-guided strategies in vaccine development, based on identifying optimal candidate antigens and vulnerable regions within them that can be targeted by antibodies to result in a strong protective immune response. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are appealing as potential therapeutics and prophylactics for viral infections. This Review describes advances in antibody discovery and engineering that have led to the development of mAbs that target viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus and Ebola virus, and also considers the implications for vaccine development.",

However, traditional vaccine development approaches 236 , which rely on three categories of vaccines (live-attenuated, inactivated and dissociated pathogens), have failed for viruses such as HIV, RSV, influenza, hepatitis C virus, HCMV or EBOV.\n\nFor most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nAntigens are generally identified by proteomic analysis of crude homogenates of infected cells and, then, chosen based on immunogenicity and their ability to stimulate an immune response. However, this approach is time-consuming, and structural integrity or immunogenicity is not guaranteed upon expression of a newly identified protein. Experimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry.

Pantaleo, B. Correia, C. Fenwick, Victor S. Joo, L. Perez\n## Abstract\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are appealing as potential therapeutics and prophylactics for viral infections owing to characteristics such as their high specificity and their ability to enhance immune responses. Furthermore, antibody engineering can be used to strengthen effector function and prolong mAb half-life, and advances in structural biology have enabled the selection and optimization of potent neutralizing mAbs through identification of vulnerable regions in viral proteins, which can also be relevant for vaccine design. The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated extensive efforts to develop neutralizing mAbs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with several mAbs now having received authorization for emergency use, providing not just an important component of strategies to combat COVID-19 but also a boost to efforts to harness mAbs in therapeutic and preventive settings for other infectious diseases. Here, we describe advances in antibody discovery and engineering that have led to the development of mAbs for use against infections caused by viruses including SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola virus (EBOV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and influenza. We also discuss the rationale for moving from empirical to structure-guided strategies in vaccine development, based on identifying optimal candidate antigens and vulnerable regions within them that can be targeted by antibodies to result in a strong protective immune response. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are appealing as potential therapeutics and prophylactics for viral infections. This Review describes advances in antibody discovery and engineering that have led to the development of mAbs that target viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus and Ebola virus, and also considers the implications for vaccine development.\n## Implications for vaccine development Antigen-antibody interactions and structural vaccinology for vaccine design.\nVaccines have proven to be the most effective prophylactic strategy for infectious diseases 235 . However, traditional vaccine development approaches 236 , which rely on three categories of vaccines (live-attenuated, inactivated and dissociated pathogens), have failed for viruses such as HIV, RSV, influenza, hepatitis C virus, HCMV or EBOV.\n\nFor most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nAntigens are generally identified by proteomic analysis of crude homogenates of infected cells and, then, chosen based on immunogenicity and their ability to stimulate an immune response. However, this approach is time-consuming, and structural integrity or immunogenicity is not guaranteed upon expression of a newly identified protein. Experimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats.\n\nFacilitated by the improvements in high-throughput B cell technologies",

This approach can significantly reduce the time necessary to identify the antigens for the development of a candidate vaccine and enables a systematic identification of all potential antigens of pathogens including those which are difficult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to the identification of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components as polysaccharides and glycolipids. Nevertheless, reverse vaccinology can enable scientists to systemically classify the potential protective antigens, thereby helping to improve the existing vaccines and to develop efficient preparations against virtually any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined. As regards the process of activation of the immune system to produce an adaptive immune response, it is generally observed that the antigen by itself may not be adequate as a stimulating agent. Many potential antigens have no apparent immunizing activity at all when tested alone. In general, seamy side of pure recombinant protein antigens and synthetic peptide antigens is their poor immunogenicity. Therefore, potent adjuvants are required for highly purified antigen-based vaccines to be effective.",

            "text": "A number of innovative technologies are now in the quiver of vaccinologists to facilitate the identification of pathogen-associated protective antigens. Four of these technologies are briefly described below. \n\nAntigenome technology -The Antigenome approach, proposed by Etz and co-workers, 2 stems from the assumption, experimentally confirmed to be basically true for antibodymediated immunity, that all protective antigens induce antibodies during natural infection. On the basis of that, the genomic DNA of the pathogen of interest is fragmented and the fragments are cloned to create bacterial expression libraries, each clone expressing random portions of the pathogen proteins. Those clones expressing immunogenic proteins are then identified by immunoassays using sera from convalescent patients. Normally, from a bacterial pathogen, 40 to 50 immunogenic proteins are identified and these proteins are subsequently tested in appropriate surrogate-of-protection assays (SoPAs) to select those to be used as vaccines. \n\nGenome (\"Reverse Vaccinology\") technologies -Differently from the previous approach, this technology is completely \"unbiased\" and originates from the indisputable assumption that protective proteins must be encoded by the genetic makeup. Therefore, the genome of the pathogen of interest is sequenced and all annotated proteins are expressed and purified to be finally tested in SoPAs. The approach was conceptualized for the first time by Stephen Johnson and coworkers using DNA immunization, 3 subsequently proposed using protein immunization by L. Lissolo and coworkers (Abstracts WHO Conference 'Utilization of genomic information for tropical disease drug and vaccine discovery', Geneva, 1998; 4 ), and finally demonstrated to be effective by Pizza and coworkers. 5 A Neisseria meningitidis Group B vaccine based on antigens (and Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), see below) selected by Reverse Vaccinology has recently been registered in Europe. 6 One interesting aspect of this approach is that it can also be applied for the identification of antigens that stimulate Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). 7 roteomic technologies -The main drawback of genome technologies is that several hundreds of recombinant proteins have to be screened in time-consuming and labor intensive assays usually involving animal models.",

The identified proteins are then tested in vitro and in vivo to determine whether they are immunogenic and induce protective antibodies. Reverse vaccinology has been used to develop a vaccine against the challenging Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [42]. Unlike other N. meningitidis serogroups, serogroup B is covered by capsular polysaccharides that have similarities to human polysaccharides. This property substantially reduces the immunogenicity of these polysaccharides and could, at least theoretically, trigger antibodies against the human host and cause auto-immune diseases [42]. In addition, a vaccine relying on recombinant proteins has been unsuccessful because of the high antigenic variation in circulating strains [42]. Reverse vaccinology helped identify four novel antigenic proteins, which have been combined in a tetravalent meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GSK) [42]. By contrast, a more traditional approach of protein screening was used to develop a bivalent meningococcal B vaccine (Trumenba, Pfizer) [43].",

Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity. Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens.

The first speaker, Joe Campo, described the use of high-density antigen arrays consisting of proteins, polysaccharides, and even cell lysates to profile multi-isotype antibodies from serum and other sample types, such as breast milk, lymphocyte supernatants, and fecal extracts [16,17]. The high-density arrays were able to identify antibody reactivity profiles associated with age, natural infection, vaccination, adjuvants and, in some cases, the elicitation of on-target and off-target responses [18]. One important takeaway was that antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses vary within and among populations so much that a single type of response (e.g., anti-protein or anti-LPS) may be insufficient to distinguish between protected and susceptible disease status, underscoring the need for broader immune profiling and account for different cohort make-up when defining correlates of protection and anticipated impact of vaccines on disease incidence. \n\nAs a complementary approach to antigen discovery, Omar Rossi (GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health) described advances in reverse vaccinology. In its original iteration, Reverse Vaccinology (RV) involved computational mining of a pathogen's genome for putative vaccine antigens based on the propensity of a given open reading frame to encode for surface-exposed, secreted, and/or virulence factors. Dr. Rossi described a new era of reverse vaccinology (RV2.0) driven by highthroughput screening of human monoclonal antibodies (huMAbs) from vaccinated or convalescent individuals or controlled human infection model (CHIM) subjects for reactivity with a desired target antigen or with in vitro functional activity (e.g., bactericidal). When coupled with high-resolution epitope mapping methodologies and in vitro functional assays, he explained how the characterization of large panels of huMAbs can uncover conformational and broadly cross-reactive epitopes that may serve as basis of vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "The concept of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in the field of bacterial vaccines by Rappuoli (2001) about 10 years ago. RV does not attempt to develop vaccine candidates by the usual approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and determining which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes. In silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the surface-exposed proteins that the pathogen is able to express and these proteins are then produced by high-throughput technologies and tested for their immunoreactivity with patient sera as well as for their ability to induce protective antibodies (Rappuoli and Bagnoli, 2011). This strategy was called \"reverse\" vaccinology because the investigators operate in a so-called reverse manner, i.e., starting from the genome rather than from the organism, to discover which proteins are potential vaccine immunogens. This genome-based strategy has the advantage that hundreds of bacterial proteins are identified as candidate immunogens even if the bacteria cannot be cultivated. \n\nIn virology, RV has a different meaning altogether and refers to the strategy of generating a vaccine from the known crystallographic structure of nMabs bound to viral epitopes. The term \"reverse\" is used metaphorically in the sense that the investigator is trying to generate a vaccine starting from neutralizing antibodies instead of trying to generate such antibodies by immunization (Burton, 2002;Walker and Burton, 2010). It is not clear, however, which vaccine discovery process is being reversed since the bnMab is simply used as a template to reconstruct its epitope outside the context of the natural antigen, using structure-based design technology. The assumption is then made that the reconstructed antigen designed to fit the bnMab will possess the immunogenic capacity of inducing a polyclonal antibody response with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab. \n\nSince the RV approaches used for developing bacterial and viral vaccines are completely different it would be preferable to call them genome-based and structure-based RV, respectively (Van Regenmortel, 2011b).",

            "text": "In comparison with conventional approaches which require a laborious process of attenuation or inactivation of pathogens, or selection of individual components important for induction of immune response, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility of using genomic information derived from in silico analyses for direct design and production of protective antigen using recombinant technology. This approach can signifi cantly reduce the time necessary for the identifi cation of antigens for development of candidate vaccine and enables systematic identifi cation of all potential antigens even from pathogens which are diffi cult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined. \n\nSubunit vaccines offer superior safety profi les and can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination [ 4 , 5 ]. When coupled with appropriate adjuvants, they can also focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not elicit a potent response during natural infection or after vaccination with an inactivated or attenuated pathogen [ 6 , 7 ]. \n\nA common observation from the process of elicitation of the adaptive immune response is that the antigen by itself is not a stimulating agent. In other words, administration of absolutely pure recombinant protein antigens and synthetic peptide antigens generally does not induce specifi c immune response. Therefore there is a need for potent co-stimulation by coadministration of appropriate adjuvants, biocompatible carrier systems and application devices for vaccines consisting of highly purifi ed antigens. These particulate systems are supposed to mediate effi cient delivery to antigen-presenting cells and may induce infl ammation through activation of innate immunity [ 8 -10 ].",

            "text": "Noteworthy, the wealth of sequenced genomes have rapidly grown in the past five years thanks to wide access to massive parallel sequencing and, consequently, a decrease in the economic effort required to obtain a fully sequenced genome. A second powerful tool came more recently from the ability to obtain the proteome of microorganisms, thanks to the new technologies available as described in the previous paragraphs. \n\nIn brief, reverse vaccinology initiates the search for candidate antigens by sequencing the whole genome of the specific pathogen. However, this is only the first step required to gather a database of candidate ORF that must be thoroughly analyzed by an array of sophisticated biocomputing tools. According to defined signatures occurring within its sequence, each potential gene/protein is evaluated to identify its specific subcellular compartment, category of functions, epitope contents, and other key features that lead to the definition of a limited group of antigens. Pools of peptides, predicted to bind specific common HLA types, can be screened. Alternatively, protein antigens might be chosen according to their peptide contents. Peptides predicted to bind multiple alleles within an HLA supertype might be of special interest, since they provide a wide coverage of all populations without ethnic bias. \n\nAs mentioned above, in addition to the genome sequence, the reverse vaccinology approach is also supported by the investigation of the microbial proteome antigenic repertoire. This might be performed using libraries of expressed antigens and screening for the immunogenicity of the proteins expressed during infection [60], or by a proteomic systematic search on bacteria grown in a variety of conditions and stimuli, or even directly recovered from infected tissues. Other approaches to identify antigens with a strong potential as vaccine candidates include the analysis of the bacterial cell surface proteome. This latter technology aims to identify and quantify those antigens that are present on the bacterial surface [61]. Proteins that are exposed to the extracellular milieu are first partially digested by treatment with proteases (i.e., trypsin), and the resulting peptides are then subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. \n\nThe discovery of protective antigens has progressed significantly since the application of reverse vaccinology-based technologies.",

There are many examples using these approaches to develop vaccines but this chapter will focus on the possible genome based approaches to confer vaccine developed immunity against two examples of endo-and ecto-parasites such as malaria and ticks, respectively. tools. The functional potential of these in silico approaches has found its pattern in reverse vaccinology. Reverse vaccinology presents a revolution in both immunology and biotechnology and shows how a biological problem like designing a vaccine could be solved by applying integrating tools. However, reverse vaccinology presents a huge advance compared to the conventional vaccine production protocols. It takes advantage of the growing number of genome sequences available for many organisms. The approach uses computer analysis of the genomic sequence to predict suitable candidate vaccine molecules. Unfortunately, the approach does not provide certain evidence that the selected antigens are either immunogenic or protective. On the contrary, the approach permits the identification of novel protein antigens besides the antigens discovered by the traditional protocols.",

            "text": "Recent advances in systems biology-based technologies have enabled scientists to investigate the immune responses induced by pathogens and vaccines at a greater depth than ever before. More importantly, these advances are facilitating the identification of robust molecular and cellular signatures of protective immunity, which can help to generate diagnostic tools that reduce the length and cost of current clinical trials. The workflow of vaccine design using reverse vaccinology is shown. First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans. \n\nWhen these systems approaches are applied to EIDs, they will enable more rapid and rational design of vaccine development. Thus, in this developing field, vaccinologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and systems biologists must work hand-in-hand to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines induce protective immunity and help drive development of the next generation of vaccines to prevent EIDs.",

            "text": "Vaccine development began in the 18th century with the use of whole microorganisms to generate protective immune responses in humans. However, live attenuated and inactivated whole viral and bacterial vaccines still belong to some of the most successful human vaccines in use today, e.g. oral polio, measles (standalone and in measles/mumps/rubella combination), influenza, typhoid, cholera, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, although there have been recurring problems associated with product contamination, genetic instability, and residual virulence. Although some early vaccines were based upon protein subunits or toxins that could be extracted from bacterial cells (e.g. diphtheria, tetanus, flu, anthrax, and rabies), it was the emergence of the tools of molecular biology that signaled a new era in vaccine development. The stimulation of protective antibody responses is still key to the success of almost all of the preventive vaccines in use today. Rather than using whole microorganisms as vaccines, identifying and producing individual molecular targets of protective antibodies, such as surface proteins or polysaccharide capsules, became an important focus of vaccine research. The challenging problem of identifying suitable surface antigens on bacterial pathogens, able to confer protection, has been approached more recently by applying large-scale genomic and proteomic technologies. Putative surface proteins on bacteria can be identified by bioinformatics, produced as recombinant proteins, and tested immunologically in a high-throughput fashion for their ability to elicit protective immune responses, an empirical approach that has been termed 'reverse vaccinology' [62][63][64][65]. The success of this approach in identifying protective antigens has now been demonstrated, even in some cases where conventional approaches to vaccine development had failed [66-68]. However, the use of recombinant proteins as vaccines continues to rely on the co-administration of suitable adjuvants to provide a sufficient boost to the immune system, and this remains problematic because of adjuvant toxicity [69]. \n\nOver the past few years, advances in structural biology have led to a dramatic increase in structural knowledge about how antibodies recognize vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "The concept of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in the field of bacterial vaccines by Rappuoli (2001) about 10 years ago. RV does not attempt to develop vaccine candidates by the usual approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and determining which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes. In silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the surface-exposed proteins that the pathogen is able to express and these proteins are then produced by high-throughput technologies and tested for their immunoreactivity with patient sera as well as for their ability to induce protective antibodies (Rappuoli and Bagnoli, 2011). This strategy was called \"reverse\" vaccinology because the investigators operate in a so-called reverse manner, i.e., starting from the genome rather than from the organism, to discover which proteins are potential vaccine immunogens. This genome-based strategy has the advantage that hundreds of bacterial proteins are identified as candidate immunogens even if the bacteria cannot be cultivated.\n\nIn virology, RV has a different meaning altogether and refers to the strategy of generating a vaccine from the known crystallographic structure of nMabs bound to viral epitopes. The term \"reverse\" is used metaphorically in the sense that the investigator is trying to generate a vaccine starting from neutralizing antibodies instead of trying to generate such antibodies by immunization (Burton, 2002;. It is not clear, however, which vaccine discovery process is being reversed since the bnMab is simply used as a template to reconstruct its epitope outside the context of the natural antigen, using structure-based design technology. The assumption is then made that the reconstructed antigen designed to fit the bnMab will possess the immunogenic capacity of inducing a polyclonal antibody response with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab.\n\nSince the RV approaches used for developing bacterial and viral vaccines are completely different it would be preferable to call them genome-based and structure-based RV, respectively (Van Regenmortel, 2011b). Both strategies require trial-and-error experimentation to ascertain which candidate bacterial or viral proteins are able to act as effective vaccine immunogens, and it is",

            "text": "A vaccine discovery process called reverse vaccinology has been efficiently adopted for bacterial pathogens that have a high degree of antigen variability and circulate in multiple strains (Sette and Rappuoli, 2010). In summary, genomic information of multiple strains has been used to select surface-exposed antigens that are more conserved. In silico selected antigens have then been expressed as recombinant proteins and used to immunize mice. The antigens that gave the best bactericidal anti-body responses or -in the absence of a correlate of protection -the best survival rate in animal challenge studies have been selected for prototype vaccines. This approach has been adopted for the development of a vaccine that was able to prevent infection by most Men B strains in mice (Giuliani et al., 2006). The preclinical results were confirmed by clinical trials in adults and infants and a licence application has been recently submitted in Europe (Findlow et al., 2010;Snape et al., 2010). The same approach has been adopted for the development of a vaccine able to protect all circulating strains of GBS . In most of the cases the antigens identified by reverse vaccinology were unknown and their characterization has often helped to understand the biology of the pathogen. For example, a protective antigen identified by reverse vaccinology in GAS was found to be the component of a previously unknown pilus-like structure mediating bacterial adhesion to host cells (Lauer et al., 2005). In the future, reverse vaccinology can be applied to generate universal proteinbased vaccines against variable pathogens such as GAS, S. pneumoniae and pathogenic E. coli strains.",

            "text": "Although this approach has been successful in many cases, it is time-consuming and fails when the pathogen cannot be cultured in vitro or when the sequence of the candidate antigen is variable. Currently used bioinformatic algorithms allow us to retrieve gene sequences from public databases, predict antigens and their physicochemical properties, three-dimensional structure, and allergenicity, regardless of their abundance and immunogenicity, furthermore, there is no need to culture the pathogen in vitro [14]. This facilitates vaccine development using non-conventional antigens or linear B or T cell epitopes predicted in silico. Since the process of vaccine discovery starts in silico by using the genomic information deposited in databases rather than the pathogen itself, many vaccines impossible to develop will become a reality. This novel process has been named \"reverse vaccinology\", and is based on the increasing availability of public genome sequence databases (Figure 1). Its use has led to the development and application of technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics, and structural genomics. Antigen candidates identified from a pathogen genome or proteome, can then be expressed as a recombinant protein and tested in an appropriate in vitro or in vivo model to predict and assess immunogenicity and protection. \n\nIn the omic era, vaccines have had a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology is taking advantage of new technologies to develop vaccines that have not succeeded, since most of the existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which depended on the empirical detection of few candidates at a time, depending on the known characteristics of the pathogen [15]. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. Genomics has catalyzed a shift from a traditional vaccinology approach to a sequence-based \"reverse vaccinology\" development, using high-throughput in silico screening of public whole-genome databases in combination with bioinformatics algorithms, resulting in a great tool to identify protein-coding genes with most of the attributes of a good vaccine candidate (Figure 1) [15].",

Reverse vaccinology is defined as the process of vaccine development where the novel antigens of a virus or organism are identified by analyzing the genomic information of that particular organism or a virus. In reverse vaccinology, various tools of bioinformatics are used for identifying the novel antigens useful for vaccine development by dissecting the genome as well as for studying the genetic makeup of a pathogen. This approach of vaccine development also helps the scientists to understand which antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen should be given emphasis during the vaccine development. This method is a quick easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine.

Empirical approaches like attenuation and inactivation of microorganisms were the first steps forward to modern vaccinology (22). Recently, new technologies such as glycoconjugates and the introduction of novel vaccine adjuvants changed the field of vaccines, however the biggest change came with the first sequencing of the Heamophilus influenzae whole genome in 1995, a discovery that allowed the birth of \"Reverse Vaccinology, \" a genome-based approach to vaccine development (23,24). This approach, following the sequencing and analysis of the Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain whole genome, allowed the identification of novel candidates and the development of a four-component meningococcus B vaccine (4CMenB) (25,26). This recently licensed vaccine has already shown incredible effectiveness in the UK with 82.9% protection against all MenB strains in infants (27). The evolution of vaccine development further moved forward with the advancement of new methodologies and technological breakthroughs. Indeed, in 2016 the \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" entered the stage. With this approach, the human immune system is analyzed at a single cell level allowing the characterization of the antibody response like never before (28). The gain of knowledge acquired by this approach allows to identify highly immunogenic antigens to develop novel and more efficacious vaccine candidates. The RSV fusion protein (F) case is a major example of the phenomenal power of the reverse vaccinology 2.0. Indeed, human B cells were directly isolated from RSV convalescent donors and cultured to naturally produce human monoclonal antibodies (humAbs). Among all the antibodies screened for RSV neutralization in vitro, the humAbs named D25 resulted in the most potent antibody with a median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.1 ng/ml (100-150 times more than palivizumab, the only monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for RSV prevention in infants) (29).",

            "text": "In the 20th century, pertussis vaccines progressed from crude bacterial preparations to the highly purified antigens used for acellular vaccines. A similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza, Hib and S. pneumoniae, as well as the production of antigens by recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., genetically inactivated PT). Despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen, the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development [120]. \n\nThe advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening, identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens. This new approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\" [121], does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. It is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. The resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). Flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections [122]. \n\nThe time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified (one at a time) and separated (different components between them) is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved. The conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial, whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years. Reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days, in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research. Moreover, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness.",

            "text": "This achievement of 4CMenB shows that the section of antigen process can be applied to all bacteria pathogens that shows antimicrobial resistance. The only condition for reverse vaccinology is the availability of the organism's whole genome sequence. In regards to the onset of reverse vaccinology, the genome sequences of anenormous number of isolates may be analyzed for homology. The whole genome sequence is necessary for the forecast of surface proteins and epitopes; which is the significant element of reverse vaccinology for the development of an effective vaccine. This implies that reverse vaccinology is beneficial for the development of epitope vaccines to combat pathogen resistance. 27 Maryam and co-workers carried out an insilico study on novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with its recent outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019 using a reverse vaccinology approach to design an up to standard candidate vaccine against COVID-19, by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology. The result shows that the candidate vaccine can stimulate both the cellular and anitibody-mediated immunity, considering the fact that B-cell and T-cell epitopes have been chosen in the final model. 28 \n\n(b) Structural vaccinology: Since it is possible to carry out isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and being able to figure out the structure of antigen-antibody complexes, reveal a new promising area in which information of structure can be used in enhanced antigen engineering. 29 McLellan and co-workers 30 reported that this technology in its early stage has given birth to vast changed antigen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by making stable the RSV's F protein in perfusion conformation. This task was not possible when ordinary technology was being used. In the improvement of HIV outlook, similar process is being used and also to produce general vaccines for influenza. Human mAbs have been crucial step to reveal novel protective antigens e.g. CMV pentameric complex, 31 and the RSVF protein perfusion conformation. 30 Despite the target of most antigen application design is viral pathogens, the technology is also applicable to bacteria, giving room for novel bacteria antigens to be identified with enhanced security within strains of bacteria.",

Within 18 months, while the nucleotide sequence was still being finalized, 91 novel surface-exposed proteins were discovered and 28 of these were shown to induce bactericidal antibodies, a known correlate of protection against MenB disease [20]. Discovered antigens that induced the best and broadest bactericidal activity were selected and inserted into prototype vaccines that were able to induce protective immunity against most MenB strains in mice [21]. After further analysis, a final four-component MenB (4CMenB) vaccine was formulated [16]. \n\nPrior to the emergence of reverse vaccinology, only 12 surface antigens of meningococcus had been described in the literature, with four or five having bactericidal activity [18,22]. With reverse vaccinology, 91 novel surface-exposed proteins were discovered with 28 capable of inducing bactericidal activity, representing more than quarter of all novel surface-exposed proteins. The concurrent use of genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics and protein arrays can significantly accelerate identification of vaccine targets and the subsequent vaccine development process. The success of the MenB vaccine has encouraged application of reverse vaccinology to a myriad of other pathogens (both bacterial and viral), including group B streptococcus where analysis of eight genomes led to expression of 312 surface proteins and the development of a four-protein vaccine that protects against all serotypes [23].",

            "text": "Traditionally, vaccines have been developed empirically by isolating, inactivating, and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them) that cause disease (Table 1; Rappuoli, 2014).Two decades ago, genome sequencing revolutionized this process, allowing for the discovery of novel vaccine antigens starting directly from genomic information.The process was named \"reverse vaccinology\" to underline that vaccine design was possible starting from sequence information without the need to grow pathogens (Rappuoli, 2000).Indeed, a vaccine against meningococcus B, the first deriving from reverse vaccinology, has recently been licensed (Serruto et al., 2012;O'Ryan et al., 2014).Today, a new wave of technologies in the fields of human immunology and structural biology provide the molecular information that allows for the discovery and design of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human CMV (HCMV) that have been impossible thus far and to propose universal vaccines to tackle influenza and HIV infections.Here, we provide our perspective (summarized in Table 1) of how several new advances, some of which have been partially discussed elsewhere (Burton, 2002;Dormitzer et al., 2012;Haynes et al., 2012), can be synergized to become the engine driving what might be considered a new era in vaccinology, an era in which we perform \"reverse vaccinology 2.0.\"\n\nSeveral technological breakthroughs over the past decade have potentiated vaccine design.First, the greatly enhanced ability to clone human B cells and then to produce the corresponding recombinant mAbs or antigen-binding fragments (Fab's) has provided access to an enormously rich set of reagents that allows for the proper evaluation of the protective human immune response to any given immunogen upon immunization or infection.A fundamental step for the success of this approach has been the growing capacity to select the most favorable donors for the isolation of the most potent antibodies (Abs) through extensive examination of serum-functional Ab responses.",

Vaccines represent one of the greatest interventions in modern medicine [1]. Ever since Edward Jenner\u2019s first use of a vaccine against smallpox in 1796, the use of vaccines has become indispensable to the eradication of disease [2]. Then, Scientific progress has driven vaccine development from live attenuated and inactivated vaccines to purified recombinant one. The recent advances in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunoinformatics, structural biology and others have led to vaccinomics and reverse vaccinology as novel approaches for a generation of new vaccines [3]. Reverse vaccinology relies on the genomic information to identify relevant protein antigens and the design of algorithm for mapping potential B and T cell epitopes for diagnostic or vaccine purposes [4].",

            "text": "novel vaccine candidate antigens.\n\nPreclinical vaccine development methods are enriched by detailed analysis of the human immune response to etiological agents of infectious diseases. For example, with the development of high-throughput technologies, deep sequencing of the gene segments encoding the variable regions of antibody heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chains in a given B cell repertoire is providing valuable information useful in understanding adaptive immunity to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies (24,25). Identifying the targets of antibodies of interest by cloning and in vitro expression of VH and VL chains of B-cell antibodies is a powerful approach, which can be utilized to inform on the functional immunogenicity of both known and novel antigens. The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (27)(28)(29). The power of the approach lies in the expression of paired VH and VL regions from individual plasmablasts or memory B cells; the output being the expression of hmAbs mimicking natural VH + VL combinations induced in the host.\n\nBecause of the transience of peak plasmablast circulation [reviewed in Ref. (30)] and the higher incidence of IMD among infants and toddlers (placing a limitation on blood sample volume), we aimed to assess whether reverse vaccinology 2.0 could be employed in the discovery of novel meningococcal antigens of vaccine potential. In this brief research report, we will outline findings relating to the following aims: (i) whether cross-reactive antimeningococcal hmAbs targeting surface proteins could be cloned from patient samples; and (ii) if these hmAbs possessed bactericidal activity against a wide panel of strains, specifically those not covered by the protein-based meningococcal vaccines.

            "text": "Today, with the advent of genomic technology, the genomebased antigen selection is possible and allows the discovery of antigen and vaccine design. One approach that mines pathogenic bacterial genomes for antigen discovery is known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV). RV has emerged as an effective strategy that uses bioinformatics techniques with the aim to identify highly protective and immunogenic peptides encoded by immunologically exposed pathogenicity factors by screening the entire genomes of microbial pathogens (Movahedi and Hampson, 2008;Seib et al., 2012;Donati and Rappuoli, 2013; Figure 2). RV based antigen discovery pipeline involves genome sequence analysis for the identification of antigenic proteins (surface exposed or secreted) expressed by the pathogen, their cloning and expression followed by synthetically producing each FIGURE 2 | Reverse Vaccinology approach: A schematic representation of vaccine development by RV is illustrated in the presented flowchart. RV starts with the computational analysis of the complete genome sequence of the targeted pathogenic organism. Computational predictions are based on algorithms trained on biological data obtained from experimentally carried out studies. The potential vaccine candidates include surface associated and secretory proteins (SASPs) and virulence factors. These are further evaluated to identify protein candidates with antigenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells. These proteins are then amplified by PCR and expressed in suitable vectors. The recombinant proteins produced are purified and used for immunogenicity testing in animal models (mice). Based on immune sera screening (FACs, Serum Bactericidal Activity), the recombinant proteins capable of inducing sera bactericidal antibodies are selected. The top candidates enter the pre-clinical stage of vaccine development. After the molecular epidemiological studies, the best candidates are used for clinical trials in adults, adolescents and infants and finally they enter the vaccine formulation process. \n\nprotein. The best selected candidates could be tested in the clinical trials for validating their immunogenicity after in vitro immunogenicity examination in cells and animal models. The identified antigens may be targeted for vaccine discovery. To date, RV has been targeted to devise universal and effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens for which the discovery of vaccines was previously impossible.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is a methodology that uses bioinformatics tools for the identification of structures from bacteria, virus, parasites, cancer cells, or allergens that could induce an immune response capable of protecting against a specific disease [7]. \n\nThis approach possesses many advantages over traditional vaccinology: it reduces time and cost in vaccine development; refines the number of proteins to be studied, facilitating the selection process; can identify antigens present in small amounts or expressed only at certain stages, which would hinder or prevent their purification; and allows for the study of noncultivable or risky microorganisms [3] An important requirement for utilizing this methodology is the availability of genomic information of the pathogen under study and, in some instances, even the human or animal cell genome must be known (i.e., DNA vaccines and therapeutic vaccines). Once the genome sequence is obtained, it is possible to identify all likely proteins that could be expressed. For this purpose, several software systems and programs identify all open reading frames (ORFs) that constitute the sequences expressing the majority of proteins [8][9][10]. \n\nThe next step in reverse vaccinology is to determine several antigenic and physicochemical properties that have been associated with good antigens. These characteristics must be analyzed for each protein in the proteome under study, employing different bioinformatics approaches to select the protein(s) with the best properties for testing through in vitro and in vivo assays, in order to demonstrate its safety and immunogenicity. With the best vaccine candidates, different types of vaccines can be designed and developed, for example: subunit, recombinant, and nucleic acid vaccines [11]. \n\nThe first application of reverse vaccinology was to study Neisseria meningitidis to obtain a new subunit vaccine based on the genome study of this microorganism by means of bioinformatics tools [12]. Thereafter, this technology has been used to study pathogenic agents including eukaryotic organisms and those involved in diseases transmitted by vectors [13], to design and obtain not only vaccines for humans but also for animals [5]. The majority of new vaccines against infectious diseases that have been developed with this technology are currently found in preclinical or clinical trial.",

            "text": "Usually, such approaches are also much superior when used to interpolate than they are when used to extrapolate. We need complete and thorough data sets effectively and efficiently able to explore the complex relationships between structure and function, necessitating continuous improvement in all aspects of data quality. \n\nWithin the wider context of vaccine design and discovery, we shall in this book describe and explore a range of key alternative strategies and technologies, both informatics-based and experimental, which are, by degrees, both supportive and complementary to reverse vaccinology and more traditional approaches to vaccine discovery. This book looks in turn at reverse vaccinology and the identification of putative candidate antigens, at the discovery of a wide range of different types of adjuvants, and finally at the development of sophisticated new delivery mechanisms, such as liposomes and other applications of nanotechnology. \n\nIn Chap. 2, Cafardi et al. review the present state of play with respect to reverse vaccinology, with particular emphasis on how completion of bacterial genomes impinges upon the vaccine discovery. They show how this approach allows the development vaccines that are difficult or near impossible to address with conventional approaches. They also highlight how advances in genome-based techniques and in so-called next-generation sequencing approaches and technologies will help to enhance reverse vaccinology, enabling timely identification of novel candidate antigens for new, emerging, or recrudescent infectious diseases. \n\nIn Chap. 3, Flower et al. review the discovery of candidate vaccine antigens in more detail. Placing their analysis in the context of emerging ideas about the possible nature of immunogenicity and how it may be propagated by elements of the immune response at the system level, the authors discuss the three main approaches to the identification of novel immunogenic antigens: sequence similarity-based approaches, whereby the antigen nature of a protein is inherited from similar sequences; methods based on identifying the subcellular location of microbial proteins, on the basis that proteins with only certain locations would be accessible to immune surveillance; and the use of empirical alignment-independent approaches to the prediction of antigens. Usefully, the chapter also includes discussion of expert systems for antigen discovery. \n\nIn Chap.",

Reverse vaccinology is an in silico approach that involves the mining of genome sequences using comparative analysis and prediction tools for the identification of antigens predicted to be highly prevalent, soluble and surface-exposed/secreted. Another vaccinology approach involves the proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by bacteria, which provides deep insight into the proteins that could be exposed on the bacterial surface and potentially accessible to antibodies. Both technologies are frequently used as standalone strategies, and have contributed significantly to the identification of novel protective antigens. For example, vaccine antigens that provide protection against extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli [9,10] and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [11,12] have been identified using these methods. \n\nHere, we employed a combinatorial approach encompassing both reverse vaccinology and proteomics to identify vaccine antigens of A. baumannii. Overall, our approach identified multiple novel candidate antigens that should form a framework for future vaccine development.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is a term coined by Rino Rappuoli for the mining of microbial genomes, usually bacterial, to find proteins of vaccine interest (81,96). The process begins with the sequencing of a genome followed by computer analysis of DNA ORFs to predict which will produce surface or secreted antigens. The candidate ORFs are then inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria for expression of the corresponding proteins. The expressed proteins are used to immunize the mice from which serum samples are collected to test for bactericidal activity and surface localization. If the serum samples show that the protein is conserved in multiple bacterial strains, it can then be included in vaccine development.\n\nReverse vaccinology was used to identify five proteins from group B Neisseria meningitidis that were combined into a vaccine now in clinical trial (4,39,91). A group B vaccine has not been available owing to cross-reaction between capsular antigen and neural cell adhesion molecules in the developing brain. Development of many other bacterial vaccines, including experimental vaccines against group B streptococci, pneumococci, Bacillus anthracis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, the principal agent of periodontitis, is profiting from the strategy of reverse vaccinology.\n\nNewer variations on reverse vaccinology include pan-genome reverse vaccinology and comparative genome analysis (104). The former consists of genomic sequencing of numerous strains of a particular organism in order to identify antigens present in common. These then become components of a vaccine that should cover all or almost all strains. This approach has been fruitful for group B streptococci (73). In comparative genome analysis, the objective is to identify antigens produced only in pathogenic strains, which is important for organisms that exist in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic forms.",

            "text": "Major efforts to improve the approaches for vaccine development are underway. As can be seen from Figure 1, the development of synthetic influenza vaccines is the third platform for influenza vaccine production. Several novel technologies that may improve the production process have been described recently. These technologies could make possible the development of eliciting long-lasting and broadly cross-reactive universal influenza vaccines (UIVs) without the need for eggs [11].\n\nWith the development of plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques [12], it is now possible to engineer recombinant influenza viruses entirely from full-length complementary DNA copies of the viral genome by the transfection of vaccine-approved susceptible cells. The gene synthesis technique combined with reverse genetics approaches allows the generation of IIV and LAIV 6:2 vaccine candidates within short time frames.\n\nRecombinant HA-based protein technology may help to solve many problems associated with the use of chicken embryos, such as the low affinity of current H3N2 viruses to eggs, and the necessity of speeding up the vaccine development process. However, the low immunogenicity of recombinant HA-based subunit vaccines necessitates repeated vaccination and the use of adjuvants.\n\nAn ideal true UIV can induce a cross-protective, broadly neutralizing immune response against conserved viral antigens; offer a combination of protection from antigenic drift/shift; and confer lifelong immunity. It is effective against all influenza A and B virus subtypes/lineages regardless of any mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA). To design this type of vaccine, the highly conserved epitopes present in HA, NA, or M2 and internal proteins should be targeted to induce cross-protective antibodies and T-cells. The development of a UIV can be significantly facilitated by newly developed platform technologies such as multi-epitopes, virus-like particles (VLP), and DNA-and mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nOver 20 different approaches are described as strategies for the development of UIVs, such as HA-targeting vaccines (chimeric, mosaic, and headless HAs, and mosaic nanoparticles), M2-targeting vaccines, internal protein-targeting vaccines, and NA-targeting vaccines. These approaches include recombinant, protein-",

            "text": "Judging by the progress made with the development of novel and effective viral immunotherapies, RV 2.0 is showing promise and is equally applicable to bacterial vaccinology. RV 2.0 was employed by Lu et al. (58) to identify functional anti-Staphylococcus aureus mAbs induced during bacteraemia. A total of ten mAbs were produced, four of which enhanced opsonophagocytosis of Wood46, a S. aureus reference strain. While three of the four functional mAbs targeted S. aureus antigens with known identities, the fourth mAb reacted with a novel antigen. Recently, Zimmermann et al. (59) also demonstrated that functional anti-MTB surface antigen antibodies can be cloned from patient-derived plasmablasts of reactivated memory B-cell origins, providing further evidence for a role for antibodies in the modulation of potent immune responses toward MTB. Taken together with other studies investigating the importance of antibody-mediated neutralization of intracellular pathogens (60), a role for the vaccine-induced generation of antibodies against pathogens such as MTB and Chlamydia trachomatis, using antigens derived with RV 2.0 is, thus, evidenced. Similarly, Bidmos et al. (61) and Blum et al. (45) cloned functional antibodies from sufferers of meningococcal and Lyme disease, respectively; thus, underscoring the utility of the approach for identifying novel targets in different classes of bacteria. Continued use of RV 2.0 in bacterial vaccine discovery is, therefore, encouraged following the surmounting of technical challenges and filling of research gaps. In the following sections of this mini-review, emphasis will be placed on human mAb cloning and serological correlates of protection, since other related technical aspects of RV 2.0 such as recombinant protein expression, high-throughput sequencing of bacterial genomes and antibody repertoires, antigen identity determination and structure-based antigen design have been reviewed elsewhere (62)(63)(64)(65)(66).",

Recombinant DNA technology has been employed to produce subunit vaccines, where is it expected that the administration of antigenic determinants only will provide good protection and almost no risk to the vaccinated subject's health. This technology has been successfully applied to produce the influenza attenuated vaccine and the rotavirus vaccine [336][337][338]. \n\nAmong the latest achievements in the field of vaccinology, reverse vaccinology is also worthy of note. This innovative approach relies on the genomic information of the pathogen of interest, namely the list of antigens and epitopes the microorganism is capable of expressing, thus enabling the rapid and fair screening of candidate antigens to be employed for the vaccinal formulation [339]. Reverse vaccinology has led to an efficient vaccine against meningococcal serogroup B; 4CMenB was reported. A similar approach has been pivotal for the selection of antigen candidates for the development of a vaccine against E. coli [340] and P. aeruginosa [341]. \n\nAnother innovative vaccinology strategy is the use of outer membrane vesicles as a vaccine platform. This approach relies on the production of outer membrane-based vesicles from Gram-negative bacteria opportunely modified to reduce lipopolysaccharide-mediated reactogenicity and other unwanted interfering reactions. These serve as safe and potent immunostimulants against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Shigella sonnei [342][343][344][345]. \n\nRecently, the generation of antimicrobial glycoconjugate vaccines has been suggested as a simple in vivo strategy to produce vaccines against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This simple strategy relies on the genetic modification of a single strain of E. coli to produce the desired vaccine through oligosaccharyltransferase, PglB. This enzyme catalyzes the linkage of a selected antigenic polysaccharide to target carrier proteins that contain specific N-glycosylation sites.",

The use of the genomic information that is available on important microorganisms and the approach termed 'reverse vaccinology' enables the identification of novel recombinant antigens that have the potential to be excellent vaccine candidates [44]. Based on the experience with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, it is expected that these highly purified recombinant antigens will prove to be much safer than traditional vaccines. Several novel vaccine adjuvants with improvements over alum are currently undergoing clinical and preclinical testing, including 'delivery systems' that are designed to promote the uptake of antigens into key cells of the immune system and potent immunopotentiators that are designed to have a higher specificity for the activation of these cells [45]. The most significant barrier to the development of new adjuvants has been the requirement for safety, but an emulsionbased adjuvant (MF59) was introduced onto the European market in 1997 [46] and additional approaches are expected to follow in the coming years. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of how adjuvants work has already resulted in the development of safer candidates, with more specific effects on limited cell types, and this trend will continue [45]. Improvements in genetic engineering approaches, including the approach of 'reverse genetics', now enable the production of viral vectors with predetermined genetic defects, which should improve their safety. In addition, the development of non-replicating viral vectors (e.g. alphaviruses) will result in improvements in safety over the traditional approaches [47]. At present, the biggest problem for vaccine safety worldwide is the inappropriate reuse of needles in developing countries, which results in infection with blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, important developments in the use of auto-disposable syringes and in needle-free vaccine-delivery systems will minimize these problems [5]. Overall, the increasing use of postlicensure safety studies (often called Phase IV studies) for new vaccine products will ensure that safety issues that arise even at low levels will be identified quickly, as has already been demonstrated with the oral rotavirus vaccine.",

Taking into consideration host protective mechanisms, antigen selection via the reverse vaccinology approach can be tailored to identify antigens that contain a combination of antigenic determinants and functional, conserved, and structural properties (He et al., 2010). In its nascent stage, the use of reverse vaccinology has yielded promising results and progress is being made toward the development of vaccines against several pathogens (Sette and Rappuoli, 2010;Bagnoli et al., 2011). Additionally, this approach is often used in an effort to narrow the number of candidate antigens to a working pool for validation and evaluation. Specifically, reverse vaccinology has aided in the identification of antigens that have protective antigenic determinants from various intracellular pathogens including Chlamydia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Mycobacterium, and may represent a viable approach to the identification of antigens for immunization against brucellosis (McMurry et al., 2007;Finco et al., 2011;Zvi et al., 2011;Liebenberg et al., 2012;Sundaramurthi et al., 2012). \n\nIn addition, availability of genomic sequences has led to the development of whole proteome assays that have been used to determine antigen-specific antibody responses against Brucella spp. (Liang et al., 2010). A clear advantage of these assays is that they will aid in overcoming some limitations of traditional assays such as 2D gels, which are based on total bacterial lysates and its signal is dependent on the quantity of antigen in the preparation. While this approach will aid in screening immunodominant antigens that have potential vaccinogen value, this approach must be used as an ancillary rather than the sole criterion for antigen selection as humoral immunity does not always correlate with the more protective responses as described above. \n\nFIGURE 2 | Vaccine candidate selection approach.

            "text": "The sequencing of the first bacterium genome in 1995 [15] ushered vaccine development into a new era. Suddenly, all proteins encoded by a pathogen were discernible and it became possible to identify vaccine candidates without using conventional vaccinology principles. The concept of reverse vaccinology involves screening the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes encoding proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets (i.e., surface-exposed, secreted, highly conserved among strains). Ideal candidates are selected, expressed and used to immunize mice for evaluation of immunogenicity and protection based on the analysis of antisera [16,17]. Reverse vaccinology allows for identification of a broad spectrum of vaccine candidates independent of abundance and immunogenicity during infection or ability to be cultivated in the laboratory. One of the limitations of the reverse vaccinology approach is the inability to identify nonprotein antigens such as polysaccharides, a component of many successful vaccines. \n\nThe first successful application of reverse vaccinology was for Group B meningococcus (MenB). This bacterium had been refractory to vaccine development because its capsular polysaccharide is identical to a human self-antigen and the bacterial surface proteins are extremely variable. Using reverse vaccinology, fragments of RNA were screened by computer analysis while the MenB nucleotide genome sequence was being determined. Immunoinformatics uses mathematical and computational approaches to develop algorithms to predict T-cell and B-cell immune epitopes, cellular localization of proteins (surface-exposed, secreted) by screening multiple genome sequences. Six hundred novel genes were predicted to code for surface-exposed or secreted proteins. These were cloned and expressed in E. coli as fusions to either glutathione transferase or a histidine tag. Of these fusion proteins, 350 were successfully expressed, purified and used to immunize mice [18,19]. The sera obtained was used to confirm surface exposure of the proteins by ELISA and FACS analysis and for the ability to induce complement-mediated in vitro killing of bacteria, a test correlating with vaccine efficacy in humans.",

By single B cells sorting and culturing, antibodies (Ab) with the desired functionality are selected and the corresponding Ig gene sequenced, and Abs produced as recombinant proteins. Three-dimensional structure resolution of the Ag-Ab (Fab) complex leads to a detailed definition of the protective epitope. Structural information and identification of the protective epitopes can drive the design of a novel optimized immunogens (\"structure-based Ag design\"). The new Ag can then be included in the best formulation or delivery system and tested in humans. The Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach has allowed the identification of the cytomegalovirus CMV pentameric complex (94) and of the pre-fusion of F protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (95). Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens. Growing knowledge in this field could lead to rational design of new antigens more stable and able to elicit high level of functional antibodies. An example of structure-based design of bacterial antigens is the factor H binding protein (fHbp) of Neisseria meningitidis. This is a key meningococcal vaccine which exists as more than 300 peptides that can be grouped into three variants that do not elicit cross-protective immunity. Definition of the 3D structure and the mapping of all protective epitopes has guided the design of a new chimeric molecule containing combination of the main epitopes of the three variants but maintaining the overall conformation and the same structural features. The new chimeric fHbp was able to induce, in mice, cross-reactive immunity against the three variants (96).",

Since then, more sophisticated ideas have revolutionized the field, such as the reverse vaccinology [28] or the next generation technologies (synthetic biology, RNA vaccines, structural vaccinology, adjuvants to human immune response). Dr. Rino Rappuoli (Glaxo Smith Kline, Italy) detailed how the concept of reverse vaccinology (a genome-based approach to identify vaccine candidates) has emerged with the development of the Meningococcus B (4CMenB) vaccine. In summary, the entire bacterial genome of Neisseria meningitidis was investigated to identify vaccine candidates for meningitis. A total of 570 open reading frames were initially found through in silico analysis. Those sequences were amplified and cloned in DNA plasmids for further protein expression. Immunization with 25 of those individual recombinant proteins elicited bactericidal antibodies and were downselected [29]. At the end, 3 potent antigens (two fusion proteins and one single polypeptide -fHbp, NadA and NHBA) were combined with an Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) for the final vaccine formulation (reviewed by [30]).",

The principle of vaccine design lies in mimicking specific antigenic components of pathogens to induce an immune response in the host against the pathogen, thus providing protection upon future exposure to the same pathogen. In the design process, selecting appropriate vaccine antigens and adjuvants is crucial as it helps optimize the formation and persistence of immune memory [86]. The application of nanotechnology in vaccine design demonstrates significant advantages, particularly in enhancing immune responses through the presentation of multivalent antigens [87]. Furthermore, the utilization of immunoinformatics tools has further enhanced the efficiency and precision of vaccine design, enabling the development of multi-epitope vaccines [88]. Reverse vaccinology approaches utilize genomic information to predict all antigens of a pathogen, enabling the identification of potential vaccine candidates through computer-based analysis, without the need for culturing the pathogen, thus facilitating vaccine development [89]. Research on the novel tuberculosis vaccine MP3RT demonstrates high concordance between immunoinformatics predictions and animal experimental results, validating the potential application of this technology in reverse vaccinology [90]. Structure-based vaccine design involves the identification and redesign of antigenic epitopes by determining the three-dimensional structure of antigens or antigen-antibody complexes, aiming to enhance vaccine stability and immunogenicity [91,92]. However, vaccine design also needs to consider individual variations to ensure the efficacy and safety of vaccines across diverse populations [93].",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0), in which the cloning and recombinant expression of antigen-specific antibodies is followed by determination of their functional activity, is a valuable approach that can unravel novel vaccine antigens, or reinforce the vaccine candidacy of already known antigens. Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) remains a serious source of concern even with the availability of vaccines. Incomplete strain coverage is a limitation of current vaccines, hence efforts to identify candidate antigens that will compose supplementary or replacement vaccines are necessitated. In this proof-of-principle study, we sought to assess the applicability of RV 2.0 to anti-meningococcal vaccine antigen discovery. Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) obtained from a patient convalescing from serogroup B (MenB) IMD, were isolated and sorted singly using FACS. The specificity and functionality of each antibody produced by individual ASCs were assessed in ELISA and bactericidal assays, respectively. Eight cross-reactive anti-meningococcal antibodies were successfully cloned; three of these mediated complement-dependent killing of antigenically-heterologous MenB strains. Western blot data shows binding of these three bactericidal antibodies to a \u223c35 kDa antigen. None of the three bactericidal antibodies were reactive with a target in current vaccine formulations strongly suggesting that the \u223c35 kDa antigen does not compose available vaccines. Unequivocal determination of the identity of the \u223c35 kDa antigen is ongoing. Given the need for antigens that would compose improved or novel anti-meningococcal vaccines, this study shows that the RV 2.0 approach has the potential to be a powerful tool in the identification of functionally-immunogenic anti-meningococcal antigens.",

            "text": "Thus, a considerable number of potential, putative, and possible vaccine candidate antigens could be missed by conventional experimental approaches. Reverse vaccinology [16][17][18][19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology was originally established and has been established by studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. Vaccines are currently available for all serotypes, except that serogroup B. N. meningitidis ORFs were found initially [20,21]; 570 proteins were then identified, 350 expressed in vitro and 85 found to be surface exposed. Seven proteins elicited immunity over many strains. The culmination of this work was a \"universal\" vaccine for serogroup B based on five antigens [22]. This protovaccine, when used with Alum as adjuvant, induced murine bactericidal antibodies versus 78 % of 85 meningococcal strains drawn from the world population of N. meningitidis. Strain coverage increases to over 90 % when used with CpG or MF59 as adjuvant. \n\nAnother key illustration is Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic gramnegative bacterium found in the chronic adult inflammatory gum disease periodontitis. Initially, 370 ORFS were identified [23]; of these, 120 protein sequences were open to immune surveillance and 40 were positive for several sera. Two antigens were found to be protective in mice. \n\nYet another fascinating instance is provided by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a prime cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis [24,25].",

Sera from immunized mice were used to identify seven antigens that were positive all three assays: ELISA against whole cell MenB, FACS to detect proteins at the surface of MenB and MenB bactericidal activity (117). This strategy allows for the reduction of number of candidate antigens and has been extensively applied on number of subsequent studies identifying vaccine antigens against group B streptococcus (118), Chlamydia pneumoniae (119), Streptococcus pneumoniae (120), Bacillus anthracis (121), Porphyromonas gingivalis (122), among other bacterial pathogens with relatively small genomes. Reverse vaccinology in parasitology, and more specifically in malaria has been relatively successful in identifying some potential antigens for vaccine development. For example, Mu et al. searched for polymorphisms in \u223c65% of P. falciparum genes and identified several polymorphic loci. From a list of 56 antigens, half of those being already known, some were confirmed as potential vaccine candidates, using human immune sera (123), one of which the Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), a well-known blood-stage vaccine candidate (124).

            "text": "Technological advancements over the past few decades have played a pivotal role in transforming the creation of novel vaccines and utilizing nanoparticles as delivery systems. The identification of highly conserved antigenic targets, facilitated by bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the success in developing multi-epitope vaccines that encompass various antigenic targets, holds the potential for broader protection against emerging diseases and expedites development timelines. For instance, a contemporary genome-based strategy, known as reverse vaccinology, has exhibited promise by identifying potential vaccine candidates (relevant protein antigens) through computational analyses of a pathogen's proteome. Additionally, integrating bioinformatics with immunogenetics has revolutionized vaccine design, contributing to improvements in effectiveness, safety, specificity, and thermodynamic stability compared to conventional vaccine development approaches. Despite its success in developing effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens in humans, such as Neisseria meningitidis, reverse vaccinology is still under investigation for poultry vaccine development. Nevertheless, ongoing research is exploring its application in the development of multi-epitope vaccines targeting bacterial pathogens such as M. gallisepticum, C. jejuni, and C. perfringens, viral pathogens such as IBD and chicken anemia virus, and parasitic pathogens such as Eimeria species in poultry. \n\nWhile not yet implemented in poultry, the success of the nanoparticle delivery system demonstrated in humans holds promise for the potential application of this technology in mucosal vaccine delivery for animals, including chickens. Ongoing research is actively exploring the feasibility of this approach for delivering vaccines to chickens, taking into consideration the relatively high costs associated with particle production. Lastly, the persistent challenge faced by the poultry industry stems from the continual emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, particularly in the \"post-antibiotic era\", necessitating a continuous improvement of vaccine effectiveness, stability, and delivery.",

The first attempt at reverse vaccinology began with Meningococcus B (MenB) vaccine. Moreover, it has been used on several other bacterial vaccines such as antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [2]. \n\nReverse vaccinology have changed the concepts and approaches for vaccine candidate selection and design. Genome investigation and selection of antigens provide a new way to study the pathogenesis mechanisms. The resulting lists of novel candidates which reveal new aspects of pathogenesis will promote the rational design of optimal vaccine antigens.

This approach works remarkably well in rodent models of disease and may be a very promising approach to control VL where this is fueled by a zoonotic cycle.\n\nFor human use, subunit vaccines based on selected parasite antigens, however, would offer a more defined and more stable alternative (20). But, major obstacles to their successful development exist and these are on the one hand the identification of the most effective antigens and on the other hand their formulation. Formulation relates to selecting adjuvants and/or delivery systems such as recombinant viruses (2,21,22) or bacteria (23,24) and exploitation or engineering of immune-modulating agents and properties to induce protective antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Although our understanding of what makes a protective response in humans remains sketchy (8,9,25), there is no reason to object to the idea that this can be achieved through vaccine formulation if selected Leishmania-antigens were fit for purpose.\n\nIn the post-genomic era, the approach to antigen selection and vaccine development has been revolutionized. The term reverse vaccinology has been coined by Rappuoli and colleagues (26) at the turn of the millennium to designate the process. The idea is simple and is about exploiting genomic and other -omics data sets to filter out relevant gene products in silico. Selection proceeds through an algorithm that is developed \"backwards\" starting from a known or anticipated mode of action of the vaccine. This has been impressively successful for the development of novel anti-Meningococcal Serotype B vaccines because (a) the mode of action was known and allowed to develop a straight forward in vitro screening assay based on lysis-mediating antibodies and (b) this assay was scalable and had high throughput capacity (26,27). The Reverse Vaccinology approach has also been adapted to identify potential vaccine protein antigens against leishmaniasis and the combined search terms \"reverse vaccinology\" and \"leishmania\" retrieve five publications from PubMed as of March 10th 2014 (24,(28)(29)(30)(31)(32).

However, traditional vaccine development approaches 236 , which rely on three categories of vaccines (live-attenuated, inactivated and dissociated pathogens), have failed for viruses such as HIV, RSV, influenza, hepatitis C virus, HCMV or EBOV.\n\nFor most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nAntigens are generally identified by proteomic analysis of crude homogenates of infected cells and, then, chosen based on immunogenicity and their ability to stimulate an immune response. However, this approach is time-consuming, and structural integrity or immunogenicity is not guaranteed upon expression of a newly identified protein. Experimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats.\n\nFacilitated by the improvements in high-throughput B cell technologies",

            "text": "Antibiotic resistance by bacteria significantly contributes to human morbidity and mortality. This is due to the irrational use of antibiotics in humans, animals, the environment and agricultural fields [1]. Antibiotic resistance is a bacterial evolution process to adjust to changing environmental milieu [2]. Novel approaches are needed to combat this alarming global health concern [3]. The use of bacterial genomic information in vaccine design is a promising approach at the present time. This technique is referred to as reverse vaccinology, which has remarkably changed the field of vaccine design [4]. Vaccines can be used to provoke host immune responses against infectious pathogens. Antigens can be either biological or synthetic in nature [5]. \n\nIn the beginning of 15th century, smallpox disease resulted in high mortality and morbidity rates. Both Turks and Chinese were trying to induce immunity against smallpox by using powder smallpox lesions [6]. Pasteur's vaccinology concept was used by Salk and Sabin to design an effective poliovirus vaccine. Reverse vaccinology is a novel tool for vaccine production, which compared to traditional vaccines is a cheap process and can be done in a short time [7]. Identification of new vaccine targets through genomics and computational techniques has not only speed up the vaccine development process but also delivers new antigens not disclosed through experimental methods [8]. For finding putative surface-associated proteins, reverse vaccinology is used without any culturing of microorganisms [9]. Using the same process, meningococcal serogroup B (4DMenB) vaccine was developed [10]. Compared to simple reverse vaccinology, pan-genomic reverse vaccinology is generally more effective as it screens highly conserved targets [11]. As an example, for Streptococcus agalactiae four different protective antigens were unveiled by pan-genomic reverse vaccinology [12][13][14][15]. \n\nIn this study, comparative genomics and reverse vaccinology methods were used for identification of protective vaccine antigens against Brucella melitensis, which is a Gramnegative coccobacillus bacterium from the Brucellaceae family [16].",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology uses the genome sequences of viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens of interest rather than the cells as starting material for the identification of novel antigens, whose activity should be subsequently confirmed by experimental biology approaches [1]. In general, the aim of this approach is the identification of genes potentially encoding pathogenicity factors and secreted or membrane-associated proteins. In this context, specific algorithms suitable for the in silico identification of novel surface-exposed and, thus, antibody accessible proteins mediating a protective immune response are used [2]. \n\nPizza and co-workers in collaboration with The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) provided the first example of a successful application of the reverse vaccinology approach [3]. They described that in silico identification of vaccine candidates against Neisseria meningitides serogroup B, which is the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults, could be effective, while conventional approaches to obtain a vaccine had failed for decades. \n\nNew powerful genomic technologies have increased the number of diseases that can be addressed by vaccination, and have reduced the time of discovery research and vaccine development [1]. Nowadays, it costs US$ 200-400 million to research, develop, manufacture and launch a new vaccine on the global market [4]. With the use of reverse vaccinology, time and cost spent on the search of new vaccine targets are significantly reduced. \n\nImmunoinformatics is an emerging application of bioinformatics techniques that focuses on the structure, function, and interactions of the molecules involved in immunity. One of its main goals is the in silico prediction of immunogenicity at epitope level. Recently developed in silico tools and databases can be used to identify, characterize or predict antigen epitopes recognized by T-and B-lymphocytes, cells that play significant roles in infection and protective immunity [5]. \n\nEpitopes are the minimal essential units of information derived from self and nonself proteins that stimulate cellular (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immune responses.",

Examples include development of strongly immunogenic vaccine candidates based on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) glycoprotein and the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [39,59]. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk and the dengue virus envelope protein were discovered using structure-guided design and high-throughput in vitro assays [38,66,76]. The culmination of the success of this strategy is the successful development of designer antigens, where structural information pertaining to existing bNAbs-antigen complexes was utilized to design linear and discontinuous HIV epitopes that were grafted onto computationally designed scaffolds [5,6]. \n\nDespite all these and many similar success stories of the application of rational vaccine design, and despite the fact that several broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 Abs have been found (e.g., IgG1 b12 targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 of the viral spike [95] and IgG 2G12, which recognizes a carbohydrate epitope on gp120 [92]), not a single promising HIV vaccine has been found after nearly 40 years of research utilizing various approaches, including structure-based reverse vaccinology [22,27,28,91].",

            "text": "Today, a new wave of technological breakthroughs over the past decade have potentiated the identification of new epitopes [11]. The first strategy is the in-silico approach that usually focuses on predicting B-cell epitopes. Until recently, vaccine development was associated with conventional methods such as biochemical, immunological, and microbiological approaches using the whole or part of the HIV envelope proteins. With the advent of post-genomic techniques and informatics for immune system data analysis, reverse vaccinology is becoming a useful tool to design and develop vaccines; in short, reverse vaccinology uses immunoinformatics for epitope mapping using predictive algorithms that are able to predict B-cell peptide epitopes [12]. Various studies have been performed using peptide epitope predictions for previously known immunogenic proteins. These algorithms have become more powerful in predicting epitopes and can be combined to increase the accuracy of large-scale peptide epitope predictions in HIV. For example, Bricault et al. [13] recently demonstrated that bnAbs signatures can be used to engineer HIV-1 Env vaccine immunogens capable of eliciting Ab responses with greater neutralization breadth by a machine-learning-based prediction approach [13,14]. The second strategy is in vitro toward the discovery of new epitopes by a phage display technology, resulting in the expression of a peptide that mimics the structure of an epitope. This reverse technology approach was used to select peptides that mimic HIV-1 epitopes recognized by different bnAbs such as VRC01 [15][16][17]. Alternatively, immunodominance assays and peptide competition assays are used to identify and characterize new epitopes based on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or fluorescence-labeled peptides.",

In addition to this, viral vectored vaccines (against Ebola virus), bacterial vectored vaccines, and antigen-presenting cells are more recent approaches. Employing nanotechnology, gene-based assays, next-generation sequencing technologies, and genetic engineering in the process of vaccine development is expected to enhance the revolutionary potential of novel vaccine types [7]. Other emerging, but more precisely relevant, technologies include the integration of multi-omics datasets, single-cell genomics, and epigenomic profiling of immunity, which have created new insights into the cellular and molecular responses that underly both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is also imperative to bring systems vaccinology into the loop in order to achieve our goals. System vaccinology uses metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mass cytometry, coupled with computational approaches, to prepare a global sketch of the complex mechanisms that occur during the development of immune responses against vaccination [8]. Two more important terms, vaccinomics and reverse vaccinology, are used for better outcomes. The former is used to study genomics and data at the system level to find the basis of variations at the individual level in the production of the immune response. The latter term explores genetic sequences to find immunogenic antigens [5,9].",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is the use of genomic and proteomic information available in databases to predict potential vaccine candidate proteins against pathogens. In conventional vaccinology, pathogen is first cultured then its immunogenic components are identified, isolated and purified by laboratory protocols followed by their validation in animal models. Due to inability to work upon uncultivable pathogens, time consumption in experiments and serious biohazards associated with highly infectious pathogens, reverse vaccinology was discovered as a new approach to identify potential vaccine candidates. This technique requires complete proteomes of sequenced pathogens and online tools which predict the vaccine candidates and screen large number of isolates for homology (Rappuoli 2000(Rappuoli , 2001;;Sette and Rappuoli 2010;Singh et al. 2016a;Solanki and Tiwari 2018). \n\nReverse vaccinology represents a complete and successful example of computer-aided biotechnology providing vaccine candidates for most complex and difficult to treat infections (Vivona et al. 2008). Whole genome and proteome of pathogens are available and plethora of computations tools help in identification of potential vaccine candidate proteins out of them. NERVE (Vivona et al. 2006), Vaxign (He 2010), VaxiJen (Doytchinova and Flower 2007), Jenner-Predict (Jaiswal et al. 2013), VacSol (Rizwan et al. 2017) and Bowman-Heinson (Bowman et al. 2011;Heinson et al. 2017) andVaxgin2 ((Ong et al. 2021)) are the major RV tools to predict potential vaccine candidates. Due to major limitations in conventional vaccinology, RV has become an initial and standard approach to search ideal vaccine candidates possessing certain characteristics (Rappuoli 2000;Singh et al. 2016a). The underlying principles in this approach are selection of proteins localized on cell surface as surface exposure of antigens is the most important requirement for the host-pathogen interaction. High level of antigen conservation is another fundamental requirement in this approach, as to provide broad spectrum immunity covering all the strains of pathogen is necessary.",

            "text": "For instance, Goodpasture's invention of methods to propagate viruses in chicken eggs, led to mass production of vaccines including for typhus [5,6]. More recently, use of recombinant DNA technology led to the subunit vaccine for hepatitis B [7]. The ability to engineer synthetic RNA aided the current development of mRNA vaccine approaches [8]. mRNA vaccines encode an antigen of interest for translation in the body where an immune response is generated against it. The first mRNA vaccines approved in history, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been recently approved for SARS-CoV-2. \n\nReverse vaccinology is an application that aids the development of new vaccines, initiated with pathogen genomic sequencing [9,10]. It was first applied successfully to meningococcus B to predict alternative antigens to develop a vaccine [11,12]. After 4 decades of unsuccessful attempts with conventional vaccine design, reverse vaccinology facilitated successful vaccine development through overcoming the challenge of molecular mimicry between the meningococci capsular polysaccharide and human protein [13]. Reverse vaccinology can be used to select an antigen for a novel vaccine which can generate an immune response through epitope selection and screening vaccine candidates in silico, speeding up the process of vaccine design and reducing its cost. An antigen is a molecule capable of producing an immune response, while an epitope is a site on an antigen which is recognised by the immune system. There are two types of epitopes, B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes. B cell epitopes are recognised by antibodies, whereas T cell epitopes are recognised by T cell receptors. The full SARS-CoV-2 genome was released in January 2020 allowing reverse vaccinology approaches to be applied in the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus was spreading around the world. \n\nModern vaccine design aims to maximise efficacy while minimising potential serious adverse effects, such as inducing an allergic reaction or toxic effects causing damage to the organism. To this end, newer approaches have shifted away from early liveattenuated and inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines, towards purified antigens (subunits), as these come with improved safety profile [14].",

            "text": "The development of an effective polyvalent or universal vaccine is dependent on the identification and selection of common protective antigens and epitopes [39,49,50]. The availability of complete bacterial genomes, including different strains and serotypes, and several in silico tools [49] make it possible to select common protective antigens that can be utilized in the development of effective universal or polyvalent vaccines for finfish [51]. Reverse vaccinology is a predictive bioinformatics analysis that can identify potential protective antigens and epitopes [51]. Reverse vaccinology was first used against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B two decades ago after many unsuccessful trials using the conventional method of vaccine development [52,53]. Over 600 potential antigens were found in the sequenced genome of N. meningitidis serogroup B. It has been shown that predicted secreted or outer membrane proteins can serve as protective antigens [54][55][56][57][58]. Despite the success of the reverse vaccinology approach for vaccine development, this is yet to be fully exploited in the identification of novel antigens for fish vaccinology. Reverse vaccinology has been used to identify novel antigens against fish pathogens, including V. anguillarum [49] and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida [59]. However, other major Gram-negative pathogens affecting the marine finfish aquaculture are yet to be fully explored. \n\nHere, we developed a reverse vaccinology approach to screen the bacterial proteomes of the most frequent marine Gram-negative bacterial pathogens affecting the salmonid finfish aquaculture, including P. salmonis, A. salmonicida, Y. ruckeri, V. anguillarum, and M. viscosa completed genomes. We identified common antigens and epitopes that can be utilized in the development of universal or polyvalent vaccines. We evaluated the vaccine potentials of these common epitopes by visualizing their interaction with Atlantic salmon and Lumpfish major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II).",

For example, the LPS from C. burnetii has been demonstrated to confer protection in both mice and guinea pigs (Zhang et al., 2007;Jan et al., 2023). \n\nThe advance of high-throughput sequencing gave way to the era of reverse vaccinology (Rappuoli, 2000). Reverse vaccinology has been used to identify such antigens as those used in the MenB vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis which represents a milestone in new vaccinology approaches (Masignani et al., 2019). Reverse vaccinology has been used extensively to identify antigens from obligate intracellular bacteria and has identified components of secretion systems and their secreted effector proteins as novel antigens (Khan et al., 2023;Sabzi et al., 2023). We are now in the era of rational vaccine design, which builds on reverse vaccinology with the addition of machine learning algorithms to identify antibody and T cell epitopes. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic significantly advanced these approaches by providing rich data to employ novel machine-learning techniques to predict B and T cell epitopes using a single framework like DeepVacPred to the forefront (Yang et al., 2021). We, and others, predict this could accelerate the development and testing of novel vaccines for obligate intracellular bacteria. Mapping of epitopes for B and T cells, commonly referred to as immunoinformatics, is the basis for the design of epitope-based vaccines (Parvizpour et al., 2020). This approach does not require an entire antigenic protein and can remove immunodominant areas of antigens that do not confer protection. \n\nMore specifically, immunopeptidomics, which refers to the investigation and dynamics of all peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II using mass spectrometry will also add strategies for vaccines against obligate van Schaik et al. 10.3389/fcimb.2024.1282183",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is a novel approach that leverages genomic, proteomic, and immunomic technologies to expedite vaccine development, particularly for MDROs. Traditional vaccine development processes, which often rely on animal models and phase 3 clinical trials for efficacy evaluation, face significant challenges due to the unreliability of animal models and the absence of clear immunological correlates of protection. Reverse vaccinology overcomes these obstacles by identifying potential vaccine antigens through bioinformatics and by evaluating vaccine efficacy earlier in clinical development, in populations with a high incidence of disease [94]. This method allows for the identification of immune correlates of protection earlier in the vaccine development process, facilitating faster refinement of vaccine dosages, schedules, and formulations. By doing so, reverse vaccine development reduces the risk of large-scale trial failures and accelerates the delivery of life-saving vaccines for MDROs such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [94]. \n\nFor P. aeruginosa, reverse vaccinology has identified key proteins such as the Type III secretion system proteins, which are crucial for its pathogenicity. By targeting these proteins, potential vaccines could disrupt the bacterium's ability to inject toxins into host cells, effectively neutralizing one of its primary mechanisms of infection. These vaccine candidates might also include other virulence factors like alginate and pilin, which are involved in biofilm formation and adhesion, respectively, addressing both acute and chronic infections by targeting the bacterial structures critical for colonization and persistence [95]. \n\nFor S. aureus, reverse vaccinology focuses on surface proteins like ClfA and IsdB, which mediate adhesion to host tissues, and the iron-regulated surface determinant proteins that help the bacterium acquire essential nutrients. Targeting these molecules can prevent colonization and dissemination within the host. Additionally, toxins such as alpha-toxin are considered for inclusion in vaccines to neutralize their cytotoxic effects. This approach aims to disarm the bacteria, limiting their ability to evade the immune system and cause severe infections, particularly in hospital settings where MRSA is a significant concern [95].",

One of the advantages of the RV approach is that every antigen encoded in the worm genome can be screened in silico to determine its ability to induce an immune response (31,74). Thus, it can overcome some of the limitations of conventional methods of screening vaccine candidates (76)(77)(78). Antigen selection can also be carefully prescribed based on clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, Zawawi et al. employed a systematic, multi-stage process to identify Trichuris epitope vaccine antigens based on the RV approach (79). The epitopes were identified from secreted, and surface-exposed proteins and any protein with any degree of homology to humans or mice were excluded to eliminate potential autoimmune reactions. Most of the identified vaccine antigens were stage-specific and had essential functions in the parasite biological process, associated with host-parasite interaction, parasite metabolism, development and fecundity (80).",

            "text": "The first vaccines resulted from empirical studies and were mainly composed of whole organisms (live attenuated or killed) or inactivated toxins. The majority of vaccine studies developed later also used conventional approaches to select for appropriate antigens. Antigen selection was a key step in vaccine development in the pre-genomic era but was time-consuming and had many limitations. The properties aimed for in these molecules were: 1) being accessible to the immune system and inducing protective immunity and 2) being conserved within the species and not containing regions of high variability (3). The selection of good candidate vaccine antigens was primarily based on the capacity of induction of protective antibodies, which probably explains why effective vaccines currently available mainly induce a protective humoral immune response (1). More recently, molecular biology methods have been applied to the development of new vaccines, primarily to enable large-scale production of subunit or peptide-based vaccine antigens. Nevertheless, only a small number of available vaccines are based on recombinant antigens.\n\nThe strategies of conventional vaccinology pose limitations for the development of effective vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. The development of vaccines against pathogens that show important antigenic variation or that cannot be cultivated in the laboratory remains a great challenge. Currently, new approaches using high-throughput technologies are being used for the identification of new vaccine candidate molecules (4).\n\nThe publication of the Haemophilus influenzae genome, the first pathogen to have its complete genome sequence published as a result of an approach to genome analysis using new technologies of high-throughput sequencing (5), has opened the mind of scientists to a range of new possible approaches to the study of microorganisms and has marked the beginning of a new era in vaccine development: the identification of pathogen candidate antigens based on the knowledge of the genome of the pathogen and on the understanding of microbial biology and host-pathogen interactions, an approach called reverse vaccinology (6).\n\nThis approach has been favored in recent years by the use of high-throughput technologies in the fields of genomics, proteomics and immunomics, among other \"omics\", which has expanded enormously. The number of available viral and parasitic genome sequences is growing continuously (2), and important advances have been made to make new biostatistics and bioinformatics tools available",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology, structural vaccinology, synthetic biology, and vaccine adjuvants, that so far had been used independently to develop vaccines, were combined in an unprecedented worldwide effort to design and develop COVID-19 vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology, the science that identifies vaccine antigens from the genome of pathogens, was used for the first time in 2000 to identify novel antigens for vaccine against meningococcus B, which, up to that moment, had been an impossible task for conventional technologies (7,8). The vaccine was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2013 and by Food and Drug Administration in 2015 and was recently shown to reduce by 74% the incidence of disease in United Kingdom and by 91% in Italy (9,10). During the last two decades, genomics has been used in the development of most vaccines, exploiting the pangenome of bacterial and viral species. Remarkable progress in genomebased vaccines was made in 2013 when an RNA vaccine against a potentially pandemic H7N9 influenza virus was produced in 1 wk without culturing the virus but using the genome sequence available in public databases (3). During the last few years, tumor immunologists used the genome of cancer cells to identify mutations coding for neoantigens to be incorporated in cancer vaccines (11). \n\nStructural vaccinology, or structure-based antigen design, was predicted as an emerging field in 2007 when it became clear that high-throughput structure determination was going to be possible in the near future (12). However, it had already been anticipated in 2002 that the study of antibodies recognizing protective epitopes was going to inform vaccine design (13). The first example, published in 2011, was the design of a single meningococcal antigen containing the epitopes of three antigenic variants of the same molecule (14). In 2013, structure-based vaccine design was used for the first time to develop a vaccine that had been impossible for other technologies, when McLellan et al. (15,16) described the stabilization of the Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) Fusion (F) protein in the prefusion conformation.",

            "text": "Why vaccines are becoming an advantageous weapon to curb AMR? This is because their effectiveness in preventing infections has hugely improved, as a consequence of the enormous technological developments of the last two decades. Since the introduction of Jenner's vaccine against smallpox in 1798, the field of vaccines has steadily progressed, but in the last years vaccine development has enormously benefited from the -omics approaches. Thus, new potential vaccine candidates can be discovered in much shorter time than in the past, when vaccines have been developed more empirically (3). \n\nThe new techniques of genome sequencing introduced in the late 1990 completely changed the process for discovering novel vaccine Ags. The \"reverse vaccinology\" approach showed that, starting from sequence information, it is possible to discover the protective Ags without handling the microbes (28). A recently licensed vaccine against meningococcus B is the first vaccine produced with reverse vaccinology (29). During the last decade, vaccine design was further potentiated by new technologies, leading to an approach that has been named \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" (30). As summarized in Figure 2, this approach takes advantage of human immunology for designing optimal vaccine Ags. \n\nThanks to better knowledge in handling human B cells and by selecting the most favorable donors, it is now possible to produce highly specific recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and also their Ag-binding fragments (Fabs) (31). Further analysis by structural biology approaches brings to 3D studies of the target Ags complexed with the Fabs. It is also possible to discover the protective epitopes capable of inducing broadly neutralizing Abs (32)(33)(34). Furthermore, new computational approaches have allowed to obtain completely novel immunogens capable of inducing protection (35). \n\nIn viral infections, new structure-based powerful vaccine molecules have been already designed by screening human mAbs from convalescent people and obtaining the molecular structure of Ags and Ag-Ab complexes, as described earlier. \n\nExamples are the identification of the pentamer as key Ag for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and of the pre-fusion Ag of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

            "text": "The reverse vaccinology approach utilizes genetic information on hosts and pathogens for the design of vaccines and does not depend on the pathogen attenuation or its administration. \n\nWith the advent of recombinant DNA technology and progress in genomics and proteomics data, sequence information began to be stored, managed, and accessed from various comprehensive databases. The information on all potential antigens of pathogens could be identified and extracted using the tools of bioinformatics followed by their experimental validation involving expression of the selected antigens in a suitable expression host by recombinant DNA technology and serological studies in a susceptible host. The first successful attempt at designing a vaccine using the reverse vaccinology approach was made against the pathogen Meningococcus serogroup B (Men B), an etiological agent responsible for causing around 50% of global meningococcal meningitis, by Pizza et al. in 2000. 30 Traditional vaccine development against Men B had been unsuccessful due to sequence variation of pathogen-surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity between the pathogen capsular polysaccharide and human selfantigen. The reverse vaccinology approach aided and expedited the identification of previously unknown surface proteins capable of inducing antibodies to kill the pathogen in vitro. 30 he term \"reverse vaccinology\" was coined by Rino Rappuoli in the year 2000. 31 Since the successful demonstration of this approach, vaccine design attempts have been made against a plethora of pathogens like Trypanosoma cruzi, 32 Mycoplasma gallisepticum, 33 dengue virus, 34 nipah virus, 35 zika virus, 36 SARS-CoV-2 virus, 37 among numerous others. A crucial step in the design and development of in-silico vaccines is to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the pathogenic protein of interest. Epitopes are modules within antigens consisting of short amino acid sequences that are capable of inducing a more direct and potent immune response than that induced by the whole cognate antigenic protein of the pathogen. 38 During infection or vaccination, the pathogenic proteins are processed by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the host.",

            "text": "During recent years, reverse vaccinology has been used extensively to identify suitable antigens for the development of anti-tick vaccines. Reverse vaccinology involves rational selection of suitable tick samples and generation and sequencing of their transcriptomes to identify candidate anti-tick antigens, followed by evaluation of their antigenicity and possible adverse effects in the host [140]. It is dependent on a battery of sophisticated bioinformatics methods that analyze genomic data to identify and characterize antigens [141] (Figure 1). Such data may include B-cell epitopes and signatures of putative antigens, among others. For further evaluation of the identified antigens, reverse genetics can be employed to manipulate the target genes, followed by determination of the resulting phenotype [54]. A number of methods can be used to achieve this, including random or insertional mutagenesis and homologous recombination, but tick research has mostly employed RNA interference (RNAi) to characterize gene function. This suffers the challenge that the tick genome bears a large number of genes, most of whose functions are neither known nor predicted. However, the current availability of the I. scapularis genome/proteome serves as a reference for gene studies in other tick species [54].",

            "text": "The main application of HTS in medical research is the analysis of the genomes of pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, with HTS host-pathogen interaction can be studied and differences in the immune response of the host with respect to B and T cells can be analysed (31). All these HTS possibilities have found application in vaccine research. Recently, a new term in vaccinology has appeared -vaccinomics. This is a multidisciplinary field taking elements from immunology and genetics, with the creation of an individual vaccination therapy as its main goal. Vaccinomics allows the designer of vaccines to achieve faster results in the production of vaccines than traditional vaccinology can deliver. One of the parts of vaccinomics is reverse vaccinology, the reverse engineering of vaccines (20). \n\nReverse vaccinology is for the prediction of the most immunogenic epitope. A whole genome elucidated using HTS is then screened by very specialised and effective bioinformatic tools to identify such epitopes (20,42). Reverse vaccinology has enabled the design of vaccines against diseases such as anthrax, malaria, and meningitis (20). The bacterium Meningococcus B which causes the last of these diseases was actually first investigated by reverse vaccinology. The studies decoded the bacterial genome and assessed the antigenicity of over 600 potential antigens. Among the 90 detected surface proteins, 30% transpired to be capable of inducing bactericidal antibody secretion (23). \n\nReverse vaccinology recently focused on the identification of vaccine antigens by characterisation of the interactions between antigens and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Guo et al. (15) demonstrated that the identification of functional peptide antigens is possible by the use of an HTS-enhanced mRNA display approach for mAb interrogation. These antigens target the immune response and are useful in vaccine reverse engineering for pathogens against which strong neutralising antibodies are available. Peptides identified through this approach were injected into mice. Consequently, the mice produced antibodies that were able to prevent hepatitis C virus infection (15). Reverse vaccinology may soon become the prescribed countermeasure against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

            "text": "The use of algorithm for prediction of subcellular location improved the power of identifying potential vaccine candidates (Serruto and Rappuoli, 2006). Subsequently, developments have been proposed to reverse vaccinology by suggesting the use of additional algorithms to find probability of being an adhesin, of topology (transmembrane domains) and to find similarity with host protein (Vivona et al., 2006). Recently, integrative approaches are proposed for reverse vaccinology by including prediction of multiple features of proteins such as signal peptides, membrane spanning regions, functional motifs and differences in amino acid composition unique to specific cellular compartments (Vivona et al., 2008). Implementing this approach, the following predictions were included: (1) First, computer analysis of the entire genome identifies the genes coding for predicted antigens and removes those antigens with homologies to human proteins. (2) Second, these identified antigens are screened for expression by the pathogen and for immunogenicity during infection. (3) Then the selected antigens are used to immunize experimental animals and examine the protective efficacy of immunization. (4) The presence and conservation of protective antigens in a collection of strains representative of the species (molecular epidemiology), is examined.

            "text": "These vaccines were developed using Pasteur's principles and became landmarks and tools that led to the control and elimination of some of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Despite their success, vaccine development takes time for those noncultivable pathogens or the ones where there is not an obvious antigen or structure to use as a candidate for a vaccine. On top of the former, variation between individuals in vaccine responses remains a complex trait that needs further attention given that a high proportion of vaccinated individuals lack complete protection after routine immunizations [26]. \n\nFinalizing the 20th century, technologies to develop vaccines were coming to an overuse since all plausible vaccines to develop were described already; the field needed new approaches to counteract the problematic pathogens at hand. Then, the introduction of newly develop technologies -such as recombinant DNA and chemical conjugation of proteins to be used as new adjuvants -leveled the field to keep going forward. By 1995, Craig Venter published the first draft genome of a microorganism [9]. This led the way to initiate a technological revolution allowing to use computational approaches to design vaccines by extracting the information from the genomic information without even growing the pathogen, this is known as \"reverse vaccinology\" [27]. \n\nReverse vaccinology serves to develop protein-based vaccines and has been applied to many bacterial pathogens. The first pathogen tackled was group B streptococcus which by using eight available genomes, allowed the expression of 312 candidate antigens and the development of a vaccine based on four proteins able to protect against all serotypes [27]. For group A streptococcus another vaccine was developed by cross-matching homology to make sure the selected antigens for the vaccine differed from human encoded proteins. By using the entire protein repertoire of a pathogen, reverse vaccinology selects the best antigen vaccine candidates, to confection new candidate vaccines that can lead to the discovery of unique antigens that may improve existing vaccines. A parallel between conventional and reverse vaccinology is presented on (Table 2).",

For instance, through genomic analysis, it is now known that the viral genome contains potential antigens which are not necessarily part of the final viral particle. It is also now known that some antigens are present in such low quantities that they cannot be purified in enough quantities and used as antigens by conventional approaches for vaccine development [185]. In this regard, we are proposing a computer-guided genome-based vaccine development approach in reverse vaccinology technology. The whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence is readily available and continues to be updated as new variants emerge. Computer programs could be used to predict all SARS-CoV-2 sequences with antigenic properties and those sequences that are less susceptible to mutation. In-silico technology could then be used to screen for all vaccine candidates regardless of how small. Hits with high fidelity for helper T cell 1 and helper T cell 2 can then be developed into DNA vaccines and expressed as recombinant proteins. The recombinant proteins can then be engineered with bispecific anti-bodies and the efficiency of immunogenicity tested in animal models and subsequently developed into COVID-19 vaccine. This approach has proven effective for HIV vaccine development [186][187][188] and corroborated the assertion that reverse vaccinology approach could be the most appropriate approach for the development of vaccines for pathogens with no obvious immunodominant protective antigens such as COVID-19 and/or non-cultivable pathogens.",

            "text": "Classical vaccine development approaches concentrate on the administration of antigens, which are ideally very immunogenic, in order to induce a specific and hopefully long-lasting immune response and therefore protection against the pathogen. With many vaccines, however, the duration of protection is often limited to only a few years at most. Additionally, in order to prolong protection, adjuvants are needed for the enhancement of the immune response. Furthermore, vaccines need to be boosted over the years in order to maintain protection. Classical vaccines are often developed against 'easy pathogens' based on the use of the structural proteins of those pathogens, which are known for high immunogenicity. However, the challenges of modern vaccine development lie more with pathogens that hide from the immune system, or which change and mutate constantly, such as HIV, Malaria, and Ebola, etc. [204]. In order to gather more potential immunomodulatory protein candidates, a novel process-reverse vaccinology-was developed 20 years ago. Whole virus and bacteria genomes are scanned, and immunological epitopes are predicted. Furthermore, conserved epitopes in core proteins are predicted to develop vaccines against many related strains of pathogens [205,206]. One example for reverse vaccinology is the development of a vaccine candidate against Ebola. With epitope prediction tools, proteins containing epitopes which present to human leukocyte antigen molecules and induce IFN\u03b3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found [207]. In the last decade, a new discipline came into focus: systems vaccinology. It combines reverse vaccinology, which studies the role of immunogens, with additional factors like adjuvants and antigen delivery. With certain data-sets gained from systems-based studies, mainly by -omics techniques, it is possible to develop better vaccines based on improved insight into the immune response induced by the vaccine candidate, and to detect correlates of protection [204].",

            "text": "However, no further progress has been reported along this line of research. Therefore, identification of more vaccine antigens that stimulate best immune responses against infections as well as antibiotic resistance is still a major task and challenge. \n\nAs an emerging and revolutionary vaccine development approach, reverse vaccinology (RV) starts with the prediction of vaccine protein targets by bioinformatics analysis of genome protein-coding sequences [16]. With the initial bioinformatics analysis, RV facilitates rapid vaccine design with less reliance on conventional animal testing and clinical trials. RV has been applied to the development of vaccines against a variety of pathogens such as serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) [17], Bacillus anthracis [18], Streptococcus pneumoniae [19], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [20], and Cryptosporidium hominis [21]. More recently, several laboratories around the world began to identify A. baumannii vaccines candidates by RV approach [22][23][24][25]. Using 10 complete and 31 draft A. baumannii genomes, Moriel1 et al. applied RV and identified 42 A. baumannii antigens as potential vaccine targets [25]. By applying RV to analyze 14 A. baumannii genome sequences, Chiang et al. identified 13 novel proteins as potential vaccine candidates, and 3 out of these 13 antigens (OmpK, FKBP-type 22KD peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (FKIB), Ompp1) were experimentally tested and proven to be highly immunogenic and conferred partial protection (60%) in a mouse pneumonia animal model [23]. Hassan et al. recently estimated the pan-genome of 30 complete A. baumannii genome sequences and identified 13 highly antigenic proteins as conserved immunogenic targets [24]. These three RV studies focused on the identification of conserved outer membrane and secreted proteins. The study conducted by Hassan et al. [24] also analyzed other aspects including transmembrane helices, 3D protein structural analysis, epitope mapping, protein function analysis.",

This comprehensive initial screening of genome sequences enables the selection of antigen candidates that are highly likely to be relevant for vaccine development. An example of successful reverse vaccinology is the Meningitis B vaccine developed by Rino Rappuoli's group (Novartis). This vaccine is under review by the European Medicines Agency.

            "text": "The omics revolution, including novel bioinformatics tools for data analysis, has extended the options in vaccine research beyond empirical strategies, promising to speed up vaccine development. It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) [194][195][196][197]. Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity [197][198][199][200][201][202]. Recombinant expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. \n\nProteomes 2016, 4, 11 12 of 24 expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. With the intention of further reducing the number of microbial antigens to be examined, computer aided selection tools have been developed that draw on available information about successful vaccine antigens to deduce common features, such as chemical properties of amino acid sequences [203] or functional domains [204], and apply this knowledge to the discovery of vaccine candidates in microbial genome databases. The latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204].",

This was successfully used in developing a vaccine against meningococcus B, which, till then, was difficult to be achieved using conventional vaccine technologies (Rappuolia et al., 2021); Structural vaccinology (structurebased antigen design) which can also be considered as a variant of reverse vaccinology uses information on the structure of antigenic epitopes and protein conformation in the design of vaccines. Some examples include the design of a single meningococcal antigen containing the epitopes of three antigenic variants of the same molecule, and a host of others (reviewed by Rappuolia et al., 2021). The stages involved in traditional vaccine discovery and development are shown in Figure 1.\n\nStructural vaccinology is novel and innovative and particularly potentially very useful in antiviral vaccine development to combat very challenging viruses that traditional approaches have failed or may fail to produce effective vaccines. Essentially, the process involves four stages: determining the atomic structure of the antigen or antigenantibody complex; remodeling the antigen or the epitope by reverse molecular engineering; incorporating the re-engineered antigen or epitope into one of the vaccine platforms; and testing the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine in vivo (Anasir and Poh 2019).\n\nIn summarizing, three broad platforms can be used for the design of vaccines: the whole organism (virus or bacterium), the parts of the organism (subunits and recombinants), and the genetic material (DNA or RNA). These are illustrated in Figure 2.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology, a bottom-up genomic approach, has been successfully applied to the development of vaccines against pathogens that were previously not suited to such development (Vernikos, 2008;Rappuoli and Covacci, 2003;Rappuoli, 2001;Del Tordello et al., 2016). The pre-requisite for this approach is the sequence data of the target pathogen, which acts as input to various bioinformatics algorithms for prediction of putative antigens that are likely to be successful vaccine targets. These candidates can then be validated by a small number of key experiments in the lab. The approach has been successfully applied to the development of universal vaccines against group B Streptococcus ( Maione et al., 2005) and vaccine candidates against MenB (Pizza et al., 2000), among others (Rappuoli and Covacci, 2003). Reverse vaccinology is a promising method for the highthroughput discovery of candidate vaccine targets that have the potential to mirror the dynamics and antigenic diversity of the target pathogen population, which includes the diversity of the interacting partner, the immune system. However, a big challenge to this end is the need to understand how vaccine developers can cover antigenic diversity and develop a systematic approach to rationally screen pathogen data to select candidate vaccine targets that cover the diversity. \n\nOver the years, a number of bioinformatics pipelines have been designed that predict vaccine candidates both rapidly and efficiently. VacSol (Rizwan et al., 2017), NERVE (Vivona et al., 2006), and Vacceed (Goodswen et al., 2014) are examples of such pipelines for proteomes of bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens and these pipelines are highly configurable and scalable (Zaharieva et al., 2017). They include multiple steps and integrate various algorithms for analysis and comparison. Shortlisted candidate vaccine targets are ranked for prioritization towards experimental validation. These pipelines are expected to improve the vaccine target discovery process. \n\nThe general characteristics desired for a candidate vaccine target are (i) highly conserved; (ii) pathogen-specific; (iii) important for structure/function; (iv) immune-relevant; and (v) antigenically similar to circulating strains.",

From many pathogens, the entire genomes have been sequenced and this number is growing ( http:// cmr.tigr.org ). The genome sequence of a pathogen provides a complete picture of all proteins that can be 22 VACCINES produced by the pathogens at any given time. Using computer algorithms, proteins that are either excreted or expressed on the surface of the pathogen, and thus most likely available for recognition by the host's immune system, can be identifi ed. After recombinant production and purifi cation, these vaccine candidates can be screened for immunogenicity in mice. From these, the best candidates can be selected and used as subunit vaccines (Fig. 22.7 ).\n\nA big advantage of reverse vaccinology is the ease at which novel candidate antigens can be selected without the need to cultivate the pathogen. Furthermore, by comparing genomes of different strains of a pathogen, conserved antigens can be identifi ed that can serve as a \"broad spectrum\" vaccine, giving protection against all strains or serotypes of a given pathogen. One drawback of this approach is that it is limited to the identification of protein-based antigens.\n\nReverse vaccinology has been successfully used to identify novel antigens for a variety of pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis , Bacillus anthracis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , Chlamydia pneumoniae , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Sette and Rappuoli 2010 ).",

Outer membrane vesicle vaccine (OMV) developed under the umbrella of generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) technology [86], DNA and RNA vaccines [87], and bioconjugates technology [88] are proving to be vital in vaccine design targeting various priority pathogens. Reverse and structural vaccinology [89,90] have also been harnessed to predict conserved surfaceexposed factors that could serve as vaccine targets. Other technology platforms for the production of custom-made recombinant glycoconjugate vaccines are also available [77]. Despite all these successes, we still need a continuous pipeline of vaccines with different technologies. The old traditional approach (live attenuated vaccines) has also witnessed some critical and valuable innovations [78]. While we celebrate the success so far, more antigenic components need to be identified by leveraging next-generation technology. For example, Mark Stevens and collaborators have recently used transposon mutagenesis incorporated with sequencing to identify hundreds of candidate genes for vaccine targets. \n\nDifferent vaccines are being developed against different pathogens, including multi-protective poultry vaccines. CVD1902, a live attenuated vaccine, is also being tested against Salmonella paratyphi A [91]. \n\nSequencing technologies integrated with scalable downstream bioinformatic analysis have also been pivotal in identifying bacterial antigens to further mitigate infection due to Salmonella. This approach was recently used to screen the entire Salmonella genome and nucleotide identity. Approximately 3,300 conserved S. enterica genes were mapped. After subtracting >50 % nucleotide identity from other bacteria, the researchers, through this approach, were able to identify ApeE, a gene belonging to the GDSL lipase family. This gene (required for gall bladder colonization) is conserved in Salmonella but absent in other Enterobacteriaceae. Immunization with ApeE (purified protein) protects mice from Salmonella and reduces gall bladder colonization. However, the number of conserved Salmonella antigens is still limited. \n\nDespite the promise of vaccines, there are still some gaps in the use of vaccination to reduce the burden of AMR. Only a few pathogens are in scope for vaccine development.",

            "text": "The first generation of flavivirus vaccines, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine, were developed empirically by serially passaging pathogenic virus in animal tissues until attenuated virus variants emerged that were suitable to be used as a safe, live and effective vaccine (1,2). Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

            "text": "Despite the introduction of these new strategies (conjugation, recombinant DNA etc.), one of the major issues for the development of new vaccines is the identification of protective antigens from a microorganism. Biochemical, immunological and microbiological methods have been successful in many cases, but they require the pathogen to be grown in laboratory conditions, are time-consuming and allow for the identification only of the most abundant antigens, which can be purified in quantities suitable for vaccine testing. Unfortunately, in many instances the most abundant proteins could not be good vaccine candidates. Moreover, the antigens expressed in vivo during the infection could not be expressed in vitro to the same extent. Furthermore, when dealing with non-cultivable pathogens, there is no approach to vaccine development. \n\nThe availability of the complete genome sequence of a free-living organism (H. influenzae) [70] marked the beginning of the \"genomic era\" that opened novel strategies in vaccine design. The possibility of determining the whole sequence of a genome (bacterial, viral or parasitic) led to the idea of using the genomic information to discover novel antigens that have been missed by conventional vaccinology. This approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\", involves the computer (in silico) analysis of the microbial genome sequence and predicts those antigens that are most likely to be vaccine candidates [71,72]. The success of genomic-based strategies for vaccine development is highly dependent on the criteria used for the in silico selection of the potential antigens, which are usually secreted or extracellular proteins, more easily accessible to antibodies than intracellular ones. Several approaches can be used to mine genomic sequences, and the appropriate combination of various algorithms and the critical evaluation of the information generated are essential for the proper selection of the antigens. \n\nThe in silico approach results in the selection of a large number of genes. Therefore, it is necessary to use simple procedures that allow large numbers of genes to be cloned and expressed, like robotics and PCR. The product of each PCR reaction is cloned and screened for expression in a heterologous system. Successful expression depends on the predicted localization of the protein.",

Genes are selected on the basis of likelihood of leading to the expression of a protein that has characteristics desirable in a vaccine candidate antigen, for example, expression on the surface of a pathogen.

            "text": "As genome sequencing became increasingly prevalent, it ushered in a new era in vaccinology known as reverse vaccinology (7). Multi-epitope subunit vaccines have been developed over the past few decades using reverse vaccinology techniques to combat a wide variety of infections such as Acinetobacter baumannii (8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), Klebsiella pneumonia (10), Helicobacter pylori (11), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12) and many more. These vaccines are effective in both in vitro and in vivo mouse model, making them viable alternatives to the cost and time-consuming process of developing vaccination in the trial-and-error process of the conventional way. \n\nIn the past few decades, demand for the use of active immunotherapy has increased, such as an epitope-based vaccination, for the treatment of different diseases (13). Prevailing epitope vaccination deficits can be mitigated by a variety of approaches including enhancing the number of antigenic epitopes that can be targeted by an immunogenic adjuvant or a carrier protein (14,15). \n\nFive autotransfer domain-containing proteins (ScaA-ScaE) and immunogenic surface antigen proteins such as TSA22, TSA47, and TSA56 are encoded by the 2.1Mbp genome of the gram-negative bacterium O. tsutsugamushi. ScaA facilitates bacterial adherence to the host cell and exhibits a high level of strain-specific conservation in its passenger domain (16). Patients develop strain-specific antibodies due to four variable domains of TSA56. Thus, potential vaccine candidates, including TSA47, TSA56, and ScaA, have been investigated (17,18). Toll-like receptors are the most extensively researched Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs); they are accountable for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR2 is frequently used as a target for adjuvants because its activation can enhance both innate and adaptive immune responses. TLR2 activation can promote a strong antigen-presenting cell response and subsequent T-cell activation.",

            "text": "Biomedical research in the 21 st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution. While traditional methods of vaccine development, such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (1), vaccine development is no exception. The shift towards omics-based approaches to vaccine development began to take hold with the meningococcal type B vaccine, which was developed using reverse vaccinology in the early 2010s (18,19). Under this approach, the genome of a pathogen is screened to identify potential vaccine targets (19), and pathogens of interest are then expressed in vitro and tested in animal models to determine their immunogenicity (19). In this way, the genomic revolution catalyzed a fundamental shift in the development of vaccines. Such technologies could revolutionize the role of vaccines given their potential to address one of the major limitations of vaccines today and facilitate the design of therapeutic, rather than just prophylactic, vaccines (20).\n\nNucleic-acid based approaches share an underlying principle: a vector that delivers the information needed to produce an antigen. When the host cells manufacture the antigen, it can then trigger an immune response. The fact that no part of the virus is introduced aside from the genetic code of the antigen means that these vaccines carry no risk of infection. Such approaches build on subunit vaccination strategies, where a component of a virus (e.g., an antigenic protein) is delivered by the vaccine. Platforms based on genomic sequencing began to be explored beginning in the 1980s as genetic research became increasingly feasible. Advances in genetic engineering allowed for gene sequences of specific viral antigens to be grown in vitro (21). Studies also demonstrated that model organisms could be induced to construct antigens that would trigger an immune response (22)(23)(24). These two developments sparked interest in whether it could be possible to identify any or all of the antigens encoded by a virus's genome and train the immune response to recognize them.\n\nThe delivery and presentation of antigens is fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus. Vaccines that deliver nucleic acids allow the introduction of foreign substances to the body to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses (25). Delivering a nucleic acid sequence to host cells allows the host to synthesize an antigen without exposure to a viral threat (25). Hostsynthesized",

In this study, bioinformatic methods were first used to screen the complete genome of a MenB strain MC58 for genes encoding putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins. These proteins were predicted to be antigenic and therefore may represent the most suitable vaccine candidates. In total, 350 novel vaccine candidates were predicted and expressed in Escherichia coli; 28 were found to elicit protective immunity. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered during the past 40 years by conventional methods [2]. Since then, the concept of reverse vaccinology has also successfully been applied to other pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis [3], Porphyromonas gingivalis [4], Chlamydia pneumoniae [5], Streptococcus pneumoniae [6], Helicobacter pylori [7], and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8]. Compared to a conventional vaccine development approach that starts from the wet laboratory, reverse vaccinology begins with bioinformatics analysis, which dramatically quickens the process of vaccine development. \n\nSince reverse vaccinology was conceived and applied in a test case ten years ago, this technology has progressed dramatically. Subcellular location is still considered as one main criterion for vaccine target prediction. However, more criteria have been added. For example, since it was found that outer membrane proteins containing more than one transmembrane helix were, in general, difficult to clone and purify [2], the number of transmembrane domains for a vaccine target is often considered in bioinformatics filtering.",

Earlier, the development of new antimicrobial agents and vaccine therapies was limited due to a computational technology bottleneck. However, in this post-genomic era, advances in the fields of genomics, proteomics, coupled with the development of bioinformatics tools have allowed for in silico identification of new drug candidates and vaccine targets from genomics, and protein sequence resources using the subtractive genomic approach or reverse vaccinology approach [28]. The reverse vaccinology approach is a powerful method for the identification of unique yet uncharacterized sequences as possible therapeutic targets [29][30][31]. Reverse vaccinology reduces the time needed to develop new vaccines and offers flexibility even for non-cultivable pathogens [32]. This approach also allows not only the detection of all the antigens as observed through the conventional methods but also the discovery of novel antigens that function on a different paradigm [18].",

NGS is thus rapidly becoming a core technology in what is now called vaccinomics [18,30], which describes a systems biology approach to vaccine research.

            "text": "In its simplest form, a vaccine is made from killed pathogen injected directly into a person, spurring the production of antibodies against the exposed antigens on the pathogen's surface. Unfortunately, a microbe's surfaceexposed antigens are often ineffective in eliciting protective immunity. In a refinement of this technique, vaccinologists have purified protein subunits of their targets and injected these subunits into laboratory animals or even human volunteers to try to identify the best antigens. In the 1980s, the application of genetic engineering also allowed the first recombinant subunit vaccines to be produced, circumventing the problem of contamination by blood components or products. Results have been mixed. For many pathogens, the most antigenic proteins may be expressed at very low levels, complicating identification and purification, or the purification procedure may destroy the antigen's structure. \n\nIn another traditional technique, first pioneered by Albert Sabin in the 1950s, a pathogen is repeatedly passed through different tissue culture and animal hosts until its virulence is bred out. Though Sabin's polio vaccine is the cornerstone of the World Health Organization's (WHO; Geneva) campaign to eradicate that disease, attenuated vaccines for other diseases have been difficult to develop and deliver. One common problem is that live vaccines can sometimes mutate back to virulent forms, causing the very disease they were supposed to prevent. \n\nThe advent of whole genome sequencing, however, has led some vaccine researchers to pursue 'reverse vaccinology.' Instead of starting with the whole organism, this approach begins with the genome sequence of a pathogen. Researchers then compare the sequence with the sequences of known antigens and toxins to identify likely vaccine antigens, then use recombinant expression systems to express candidate genes. A series of screens and animal tests identifies the most immunogenic products, which can then form the basis of an experimental vaccine. \n\nChiron Vaccines (Oxford, UK), which coined the term 'reverse vaccinology,' has already demonstrated the method's potential. The company has a conjugated subunit vaccine that targets type C meningococcal disease, which is caused by Neisseria meningitidis.",

            "text": "This timely book reviews major advances in the field of bacterial vaccines made possible by the increasing number of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens determined in the last 15 years. Following an introductory chapter by Ruth Arnon of the Weizmann Institute describing various vaccine strategies used against microbial diseases, Chapter 2 by Rino Rappuoli and his colleagues from Novartis Vaccines in Siena, gives a comprehensive overview of a new approach known as reverse vaccinology. This approach, introduced ten years ago, was called reverse vaccinology because it does not search for vaccine candidates by the classical approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and establishing which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response, but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatic analyses of entire bacterial genomes. \n\nIn silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the antigens that the pathogen is able to express and this allows investigators to choose in a reverse manner, starting from the genome rather than from the organism, which potentially surface-exposed proteins should be further investigated. The surface proteins are expressed using high-throughput technologies and then tested for immunoreactivity with patient sera and in immunogenicity and protection studies. Chapter 2 also describes various techniques used in reverse vaccinology such as in silico antigen prediction, protein identification by mass spectrometry, high-throughput antigen generation, the use of animal models for testing protection efficacy and the methods used for testing the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. Compared to earlier approaches which were always restricted to only a small number of purified antigens, reverse vaccinology identifies hundreds of proteins as potential vaccine candidates and tests them for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Another advantage is that this strategy can be used with microorganisms that cannot be cultivated. \n\nOne chapter of the book is devoted to the first successful application of this new approach, namely the development of a vaccine against Meningococcus B (Men B), the pathogen that causes 50% of meningococcal meningitis worldwide. From a total of 2158 predicted open reading frames in the genome, 570 were selected as being potentially surface-exposed and 350 were successfully cloned in E. coli and purified in sufficient amounts for immunizing mice.",

We also described some of the current technologies being applied to vaccine development for pathogens that have resisted more traditional/conservative vaccine approaches. For each of the emerging technologies, we gave examples of how these technologies were being utilized for vaccine development, in animal studies and in some cases, clinical testing in humans. There are many technologies and approaches not described in this review; i.e., deceptive imprinting, immune refocusing, RNA, nanotechnologies, among others. \n\nMany challenges to vaccine development exist. The type of immune response elicited by a vaccine (i.e., humoral vs. cellular responses), the strength (i.e., does it protect against any level of infection, reduce severe infection) and longevity of (i.e., single immunization or are boosters necessary) that response could significantly impede vaccine development. Vaccine development can be further hindered by how the immune response is generated (i.e., protein, epitope, antibody) and delivered (i.e., viral vectors, adjuvants, formulated). Once a vaccine is developed through study in animal models, there can be challenges with scale up for mass production (i.e., use in human trials), dosing, route of administration (i.e., intramuscular, intranasal, oral) and effectively protecting diverse target populations (i.e., infants, immunocompromised individuals, elderly). Each of these facets introduces additional elements that need to be studied, understood and addressed when developing a vaccine. \n\nCurrent technologies are primarily focused on improving the quality of the immune response via rational design of the antigen through stabilizing complex structure(s) and identifying neutralizing epitopes. High levels of variability in antigenic proteins can pose a unique barrier to vaccine development-how to target a protein or epitope subject to selective pressures? Often the most abundant antibodies in seropositive sera are not the most potent or effective at neutralizing infection, as is the case with CMV, where the majority of antibodies target gB but the most potent are directed towards the gH/gL/UL128-131 complex.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is an emerging and revolutionary vaccine development approach that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences. Predicted proteins are selected based on desirable attributes. Reverse vaccinology was first applied to the development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults [Pizza et al., 2000]. The complete MenB genome was screened using bioinformatics algorithms for open reading frames coding for putative surfaceexposed or secreted proteins, which are susceptible to antibody recognition and therefore the most suitable vaccine candidates. Out of approximately 600 novel vaccine candidates, 350 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and 28 were found to elicit protective antibody response. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered over the previous 40 years by conventional methods [Pizza et al., 2000]. Derived from the first reverse vaccinology attempt, Bexsero, a multicomponent, broadcoverage MenB vaccine, was developed. Following the generation of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data on Bexsero, Novartis submitted a Marketing Authorization Application in late 2010 to the European Medicines Agency for the use of Bexsero in humans [Althoff and Gassenbach, 2010]. This milestone occurred approximately 10 years after the first reverse vaccinology publication, representing a huge success in vaccine research and development (R&D). \n\nBesides identifying secreted or outer membrane proteins, many more reverse vaccinology criteria have been developed since its first application report in 2000 described above. For example, when an outer membrane protein contains more than one transmembrane helix, the recombinant protein is often difficult to clone and purify [Pizza et al., 2000]. Therefore, the number of transmembrane domains of a protein can be used as a filtering criterion. Another criterion is the selection of bacterial adhesins that are responsible for adherence, colonization, and invasion of microbes to host cells [Sachdeva et al., 2005].",

            "text": "Antigen expression is often dependent on growth conditions, and the medium may be very complex. 31 These conditions are difficult to reproduce and regulate in vitro. The combination of transcriptional and proteomic analysis may provide a means to identify key antigens associated with tissue or cellular persistence and potential virulence. Such analyses could provide means to simplify vaccine formulations to include only protective antigens and reduce the presence of nonprotective, potentially interfering bacterial proteins. Not only would this potentially improve efficacy, but it could also improve safety profiles by reducing the antigenic mass in a vaccine dose. \n\nThe continued use of alternative expression systems has many potential advantages. Transgenic expression of protein antigens and plant-based systems may provide access to oral vaccines as well as enhanced stability of antigens. 32 Expression of antigens in avirulent viruses, bacteria, and yeast and insect cells may provide both manufacturing and user safety by eliminating the need to use a virulent or partially virulent microbe to provide immunity. 33 Further development of nucleic acid vaccines may provide even greater formulation simplicity and biosecurity. Viral particles such as capsids from avirulent viruses may serve as building blocks to deliver nucleic acids, protein subunit antigens, and microadjuvants directly to secondary lymphoid tissue. Not only would these biologically engineered vaccines provide targeted immunity and eliminate the need to work with dangerous microbes, they very likely would reduce the time required for the onset of immunity, with excellent safety characteristics. \n\nOne of the most pressing problems associated with manufacturing vaccines is the requirement to rapidly modify antigen formulations as new diseases emerge or as older pathogens mutate and reemerge. Transcriptomics and proteomics combined with established recombinant or synthetic approaches could potentially provide antigens that could be rapidly formulated with approved new-generation adjuvants to produce novel and efficacious vaccines. 31 These technologies are commonplace in experimental laboratories. Using combinations of proteomics, reverse genetics, recombinant or molecular syntheses, and stable, consistent adjuvant platforms will allow development of ''first line of defense'' vaccines for a rapidly emerging disease in a short time. Such a use-inspired approach to vaccines would allow the use of assembly-line techniques to manufacture vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccination first began in the 18th Century when Edward Jenner protected humans from smallpox by administering material from humans infected with cowpox. In the 19th Century, Pasteur, Koch, Ramon and M\u00e9rieux pioneered the development of live-attenuated and killed vaccines, and inactivated toxins, to protect against rabies, cholera, plague and typhoid. Additional major vaccine developments in the 20th Century provided protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, several types of meningococcus and pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae B, hepatitis and influenza. Collectively, these vaccines have eliminated most of the life-threatening childhood diseases that previously caused millions of deaths and severe morbidity, thus rendering vaccination one of the most effective medical interventions in history [1,2]. In the 21st Century, vaccination continues to play a highly significant and expanding role in the control and elimination of disease. Nevertheless, many important disease-causing infections are not yet preventable by vaccination, including, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), groups A and B streptococcus (GAS, GBS), malaria, tuberculosis and ebola. Moreover, certain vulnerable population groups generally tend to be poorly served by vaccination. Therefore, further research and development of novel vaccines is required to address a plethora of currently unmet, globally-significant medical needs [3]. \n\nOne of the most important advances in vaccine research over the last 10-15 years was the advent of whole-genome sequencing technology. Genomics drove the development of the \"reverse vaccinology\" approach, which overcame challenges that had not been resolved via conventional vaccinology [4]. Indeed, it was the whole-genome sequencing of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B that enabled the development of reverse vaccinology for the identification of recombinant antigens for a protein-based vaccine against serogroup B meningococcus [5,6]. Since then, it has become routine to obtain the amino acid sequence of all possible proteins that a pathogen might encode in its genome, which greatly potentiates the early stages of vaccine discovery.",

            "text": "For more than 100 years, since the initial and successful attempts by Louis Pasteur, candidate vaccines have been developed in large part by the classical approach of isolating a bacterial or viral pathogen, inactivating or attenuating its infectious capabilities then administering the vaccine to the individual to be protected. Even when this general approach has failed or has been only partially successful, it has served to guide improvements in vaccine design. The trial-and-error approach has also been performed to obtain vaccine products designed as pooled or single purified antigens chosen among the most relevant according to their role in microbial pathogenicity and to the immunodominance of their specific epitopes. Unfortunately, this classical approach has not been successful in a number of the most dangerous infectious diseases. Yet, deepening/extending our knowledge on the structure and the function of many antigens allowed vaccinologists to identify a number of key features for the ideal antigen. First, the antigen should be located on the surface of the microorganism and it should preferably play a direct role in pathogenesis. It should necessarily be expressed during certain phase(s) of the infection and, specifically, when presenting cells (APCs) may efficiently process it. The antigen should carry CD4 and/or CD8 epitopes to activate humoral and/or cellular specific immune response that might contrast survival and replication according to the biology of the infection. Furthermore, its presence and structure should be highly stable within strains of the same species. \n\nIn the late 1990s, reverse vaccinology was proposed by scientist Rino Rappuoli to address all these constraints to attain a reliable and efficient approach that is expected to allow a relentless progression toward novel and efficient vaccines [59]. Reverse vaccinology is based on technologies that allow an outstanding wide availability of information about any possible antigen elaborated by the pathogen of interest. The first powerful tool came from the ability to access the genomes of microorganisms, since 1995, when Craig Venter published the genome of the first free living organism [1]. Noteworthy, the wealth of sequenced genomes have rapidly grown in the past five years thanks to wide access to massive parallel sequencing and, consequently, a decrease in the economic effort required to obtain a fully sequenced genome.",

            "text": "The term \"reverse vaccinology\", coined by Rappuoli, is a genome-based approach for vaccine design and development [171,172]. Traditional vaccine development approaches involve laborious and time-consuming testing of immunogenic and protective potential of several pathogen-derived antigens to identify and develop the best candidate vaccines. On the other hand, reverse vaccinology employs in silico analysis of genome and protein sequences of pathogens, facilitating systematic identification of all the potential antigens for downstream testing and development of vaccine candidates [172]. This approach can significantly reduce the time and the cost needed to identify vaccine candidates and is also suitable for the difficult-to-culture pathogens [173]. Reverse vaccinology approaches are currently being used for designing vaccines against diverse viruses, bacteria, and other parasitic infections [171,174,175]. The bioinformatic approaches used in reverse vaccinology consider the following features of a pathogen to identify the potential useful antigens/epitopes: (a) unique protein sequence, (b) high-scoring B cell and T cell epitopes, (c) highly conserved sequences, (d) peptide sequences that can bind to pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, and (e) ability to be presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules irrespective of their diversity among human populations [176].\n\nIn reverse vaccinology for viruses, the viral genomes are sequenced and aligned to identify the regions unique to the given strain of the virus. So far, hundreds of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced and their sequences are available in public databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/). Further, an open-source genome browser was developed for interactive sequence visualization with downstream applications, including vaccine design [177]. For example, a recent study has designed potentially effective vaccine targets using reverse vaccinology and machine learning (ML) [178] In this study, the authors compared genomes of several CoVs using Vaxign-ML and predicted the S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins to be highly antigenic. As an additional strategy, a comparison of the three-dimensional structures",

By targeting critical immune components, reverse vaccinology complements the work done with MVA and other platforms, ensuring that vaccines elicit robust CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses, crucial for recognizing and eliminating infected cells. Additionally, potent B-cell responses lead to the production of neutralizing antibodies, providing long-term immunity. For instance, Bhattacharya et al. (2022) utilized immunoinformatics methods to design a vaccine targeting multiple virus epitopes, optimizing its ability to induce a solid and comprehensive immune response (50). Current vaccine strategies, including those for viral vector-based vaccines, have demonstrated both T-cell and B-cell mediated responses, contributing to their protective efficacy. While this reverse vaccinology approach has not yet been explicitly tested in viral vector-based vaccines, the principles of epitope design could be applied to enhance the effectiveness of such vaccines. Similarly, Ullah et al. ( 51) demonstrated how immunoinformatics analyses can predict vaccine constructs' stability, immunogenicity, and non-allergenicity, which could also be leveraged to improve the formulation of viral vector-based vaccines (51). \n\nIntegrating these approaches accelerates vaccine development and creates safer and more effective vaccines for combating monkeypox and other emerging pathogens. Combining these innovative methods promises to transform the vaccine landscape as we progress, offering more adaptive and targeted strategies to combat viral outbreaks.",

            "text": "The main alternative subunit approach to Salmonella vaccines from the glycoconjugates is the development of vaccines from recombinant or purified proteins. 74,139,140 These potentially have the advantage of cross-protection if carefully selected through bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequences as part of a reverse vaccinology approach to vaccine antigen discovery. 87 As proteins, such vaccines can induce both antibody and T cell responses. There are issues with preserving the conformation of proteins with multiple membrane-spanning domains that can result in the induction of antibodies with poor function on immunization. Such proteins may be better prepared by purification from whole Salmonella rather than recombinant technology. 140 A better knowledge of the B cell and T cell epitopes of Salmonella would be of great help for advancing the proteinbased vaccine approach. The proteins that have received most attention to date have been flagellin and porins OmpC, F and D. As described earlier, preclinical studies in the mouse model have demonstrated promise for all of these antigens with immunization resulting in protection against Salmonella challenge. 50,69,73,74 OmpC and F induce long-lasting antibody responses in mice 139 and have been found to be safe and immunogenic when tested in a Phase 1 study in man. 140 However, such vaccines are not necessarily amenable to simple production methods. The importance of preserving the correct conformation of such antigens has been indicated by the failure of recombinant Salmonella porins to protect mice. 172 An innovative strategy to maintain the conformational integrity of Salmonella antigens, while avoiding laborious purification steps, is GMMA technology. GMMA (Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens) 159,174 are small particles of 50 to 90 nm diameter consisting of blebs of outer membrane. Their shedding from the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Salmonella, is enhanced following the genetic deletion of proteins that span the periplasm and serve to maintain the integrity of the inner and outer membranes. Deletion of the tolR gene of Salmonella and Shigella 66,158,159 results in the upregulation of this shedding process enabling the production of very high vaccine substance yields.

The core vaccine proteins were identified using pan-proteome analysis and used for broad spectrum epitopes prioritization [23]. Further, it was ensured that the selected epitopes are vital for the pathogen survival that are not human homologs, and are exposed to the host immune system for efficient recognition and processing.

            "text": "While antibody therapeutics are responsible for passive immunization, a vaccine is defined as a preparation capable of stimulating an active immune response in the host. Active immunity includes both the humoral response (antibodymediated) and the cellular-mediated immune response. 96 The ideal vaccine should cause a prolonged neutralizing immune response in the host and is composed of an antigen complemented with adjuvants. \n\nTraditional vaccine discovery approaches relied on the direct investigation of pathogen components hypothesized to have a role in eliciting responses to identify protective antigens. This approach has led to the development of many lifesaving vaccines but has shown limitations in targeting infectious diseases or other pathologies characterized by immune evasion mechanisms. Examples are HIV, influenza, or malaria pathogens whose surface proteins elicit extreme sequence variation or are shielded by glycans (HIV, hepatitis C). The search for anticancer vaccines, a hot field of study at the moment, may also need different approaches. 97,98 n 2000 99 Rappuoli and colleagues spurred a dramatic change in the field by introducing the paradigm of Reverse Vaccinology, which has led to the development of a vaccine against meningococcus B. Taking advantage of whole genome sequencing, possible antigenic species are sorted out with the aid of immuno-bioinformatics tools, subject to different criteria such as surface exposition, conservation, toxicity, and allergenicity. The most promising species are then screened experimentally for their immunogenic activity. More recently, the term Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 has been coined to refer to the advancements brought to the field by the analysis of human protective antibodies, sequencing and cloning of B-cell repertoires together with structural characterization of antigens and epitopes. 97,100 The investigation of effective antibody response allows the identification of promising corresponding antigens/epitopes. \n\nVarious open-source tools for complete RV workflows have been designed mainly for bacterial antigen discovery. They can be classified in filtering based methods such as Vaxign, 101 NERVE, 102 Jenner-predict, 103 and VacSol, 104 or machine learning-based methods including VaxiJen, 105 Vacceed, 106 Vaxign-ML, 107 and the Bowman-Heinson 108,109 method.",

            "text": "These components first emerged in the first jawed fish, which include cartilaginous and teleost fish [30]. \n\nVaccination stands as a cornerstone in the defence against pathogenic organisms, contributing significantly to the sustainability of aquaculture, as emphasized by [31]. Today's vaccine technology is very precise, focusing on specific pathogenic parts. This is usually done by using subunit or recombinant DNA/RNA particle vaccines [32]. These vaccines centre on the production of antigens, substances that trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses, a fundamental defence mechanism that guards organisms against pathogenic invaders. Notably, the role of certain pathogenic components, like the major capsid protein (MCP), has become more important in the development of vaccines because of how they cause diseases. For example, in viral erythrocytic necrosis (VEN), the virus needs the MCP to get into the host cell. This makes it a great target for lowering the costs of the disease [33]. Furthermore, the major capsid protein of Grouper Iridovirus, as identified by [34], has been recognised not only as a potential biomarker for infected cells but also as a pivotal element in the development of effective vaccines. The field of immunoinformatics uses prediction tools for many immunobiotechnology and immunomics processes to make vaccines, kits, and biological products that help treat cancer, allergies, and infectious diseases [35]. The use of bioinformatics can help in dangerous substance detection, tissue transplantation ease, and MHC genotyping. Furthermore, bioinformatics enables a better understanding of the functions and interactions of toll-like receptors (TLRs). The first example of such a procedure is reverse vaccinology. Reverse Vaccinology (RV) is a powerful and novel in silico vaccine design approach that overcomes the limitations of current vaccinology methods. It involves a computational-based analysis called subtractive genomics, which is used to prioritise drug targets and vaccine candidates [36]. This approach directly screens genome sequence assemblies, making it a robust method for identifying potential targets and candidates. Reverse vaccinology shortens the time required for vaccine development and evaluation of efficacy against targets [37].",

The recombinant protein vaccines as the third-generation vaccines can induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular immune responses in the host (Fig. 1). In this type of vaccines, genes encoding protective antigens are recombinantly expressed (Baxter 2007) (Scott and Cheryl 2004). \n\nIn 1987, Hilleman M et al. developed Recombivax as the first recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B through cloning and recombinant expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hilleman 1987). Until now, numerous recombinant vaccines have been approved against viral pathogens such Human papilloma virus (Slade et al. 2009), Influenza (Girard et al. 2013), and bacterial pathogens including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Jacobs et al. 1990) and Meningococcal (Cooper et al. 2011). \n\nRecently, a recombinant vaccine called shingrix has been developed against shingles disease caused by the varicella zoster virus with a high level protection (up to 90%) against this disease (Raedler 2018). One of the main challenges in the development of recombinant vaccines is the selection of the suitable target antigens. At present, reverse vaccinology is one of the promising approaches to identify repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, with surface exposure, and conserved among multiple strains (Rappuoli et al. 2016) (Zeng et al. 2017).",

            "text": "To cater to fast development and safer products, a new paradigm is taking shape in vaccine development. The availability of genomic data, the advancements in bioinformatics, technology and computing resources and increased understanding of immune responses and immunogenetics are moving developments away from \"one size fits all\" product prescriptions to one where possibilities of orientation towards individual, community and population specificity can exist in new vaccine design [12]. This is deemed to be of increasing necessity in hyper-variable viruses like coronavirus, influenza, and the like, where traditional vaccines are failing to cope with the changes [12,13]. Rational design of vaccines and the science of \"reverse vaccinology\", as a yet nascent culture, are pointers towards the future of vaccine development. \n\nPeptide vaccines belong to one of these new categories. The idea is to scan the viral genome for the protein antigens that can elicit an immune response and then synthesize them into a peptide vaccine. A more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response [14]. The recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. Peptide vaccines have been in use against animals for some time. The first reported success was with the virulent canine parovirus [15], stimulating development of other peptide vaccines against diseases, such as malaria [16] and classical swine fever virus [17] in animals, and vaccines for humans are in various stages of trials [18]. Recombinant DNA technology and naked DNA have been used to induce immune response against virus infections; synthetic peptide vaccines have been the other approach in peptide vaccinology [19].",

            "text": "Early regions constitute 50% of the viral genome containing E1, E2, E4, E6, and E7 segments. However, the late region contains L1 and L2 genes constituting 40% of genome, leaving 10 percent of regulatory regions [8]. Some of these segments are antigenic and activate the immune system and could be used as potential vaccine candidates. Among HPV proteins, capsid proteins L1 and L2 and regulatory proteins E2 and E6 are comparatively conserved proteins, are able to trigger specific immune responses, and immunization with these proteins confers protection against HPV infection in experimental animal models [9]. Antigen identification is considered as a significant barrier in vaccine design, as this is usually achieved through time-consuming and laborintensive in vitro and in vivo experiments [10]. Reverse vaccinology is the radical change in vaccine research. The reverse vaccinology approach is the discovery of new antigens through whole genome sequencing following laboratory-based analysis to find efficacy of these antigens to induce protective immunity [11]. Genome wide studies and reverse vaccinology have helped health professionals and scientists to modify prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against a variety of infectious diseases. The availability of genomic and proteomic information now enabled researchers to explore the proteomic segments of these virulent strains without culturing them in labs to save time and resources. These information support to find new antigens against HPV and other infectious agents [12]. Efforts have focused on developing new strategies for rational and fast antigen identification among a number of viral proteins. Furthermore, recent reports support that epitope-based vaccines appear to be capable of inducing more potent responses than whole protein vaccines [13]. T-cell epitope prediction of protein sequences by bioinformatics analysis has been proposed as a promising strategy for vaccine development and an increasing number of tools have been developed, based on different algorithms and methods [14]. T-cells from genetically distinct populations would recognize and respond to a single peptide epitope, underline the need of identifying one or more epitope(s) that bind to multiple HLA (Human leukocyte antigen) alleles and cover close to 100% of the genetically diverse human population.",

            "text": "42). Paradigms are sometimes followed because they appear to have been useful for achieving earlier vaccine successes and they may then continue to be used even if they are incompatible with more recent immunological knowledge (4,14). Other invalid paradigms used in HIV vaccinology have been discussed previously (4,(43)(44)(45).\n\nWHat is strUCtUre-Based reVerse VaCCinoLoGy (sBrV)?\n\nTwo types of reverse vaccinology should be distinguished. Genome-based reverse vaccinology, introduced by Rino Rappuoli (46) predicts potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes and has allowed the development of several effective bacterial vaccines (47). A completely different approach was proposed by Burton (48) for developing viral vaccines and it has been suggested that this should be called SBRV to clearly differentiate it from genome-based reverse vaccinology (49). Such a nomenclature is more explicit than calling the two procedures \"reverse vaccinology 1\" and \"reverse vaccinology 2, \" respectively (50).\n\nStructure-based reverse vaccinology attempts to generate a vaccine by first determining the X-ray crystallographic structure of a complex between, for instance, an HIV Env and a bnMab, and then using the 3D structure of the Mab as a template to reconstruct the epitope by reverse engineering outside the context of the Env protein in which it was originally embedded. This approach was called vaccine design because it was assumed that the reconstructed epitope designed to fit the Mab might be able to acquire the immunogenic capacity to induce a polyclonal Ab response endowed with the same neutralizing capacity as the bnMab. However, what was being designed was an antigen able to bind the Mab and not a viral immunogen able to induce a protective immune response (45,51).\n\nThe SBRV approach only focuses on the recognition process between a single epitope-paratope pair and it does not take into account that Abs are produced by the IS and not by the viral immunogen and that T cell help always play a crucial role. Properties of the IS such as the Ab gene repertoire, self-tolerance, the presence of appropriate helper and suppressor T cells, the production of cytok",

            "text": "To combat AR and to eliminate this alarming global health issue, both therapeutically and prophylactically, the introduction of novel approaches remains vital [24]. Boosting host immunity via immunotherapeutic and immunological interventions among various approaches proposed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is an attractive solution to fight the challenges of AR [25]. Reverse vaccinology (RV) is an up-to-date approach and is used to identify putative surface-associated proteins without the need to culture the microorganisms [26]. Through immunotherapy, pathogen-specific antibodies can be designed and produced; meanwhile, immunological interventions in the human immune system are trained to tackle bacterial infections by acquiring adaptive immunity [27]. The latter strategy, using vaccines in particular, holds great importance in lowering the burden of AR [28]. Conventional vaccine development is expensive, time consuming, and needs many human resources [21]. The genomic revolution will greatly aid in disclosing new vaccine candidates that, by traditional vaccine development, are hard to detect [29]. Next-generation sequencing of bacterial pathogens and advanced bioinformatics practices in vaccinology are now commonly employed for the identification of putative surface-associated antigens [30]. The meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine was effectively developed using the RV approach [31]. Pan-genomic reverse vaccinology (PGRV), specifically, is more effective compared to conventional RV, as it screens highly conserved targets that are strain specific [32]. For example, the genome of Streptococcus agalactiae revealed four protective antigens identified via the PGRV approach [6]. \n\nProvidencia is a group of opportunistic urease-producing Gram-negative, motile, and rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. P. rettgeri can cause a variety of hospital-acquired infections, i.e., urinary tract infections, wounds, human blood infections, gastroenteritis, and bacteremia [33] P. rettgeri is ubiquitous in the environment.",

RV offers advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and safety by reducing the need for complex procedures and animal immunization. It has been successfully applied in the development of vaccines for various diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and HPV. Challenges remain, but RVs efficiency, specificity, and potential cost savings position it as a powerful tool in global vaccine development efforts. Continued research and innovation in antigen optimization, epitope design, linker selection, safety considerations, and collaboration will further enhance RVs potential for tackling existing and emerging diseases.

            "text": "This is a modern method of developing vaccines. It involves the recombinant expression of proteins and viral vectors. This technology provides the possibility of developing vaccines against difficult-to-culture or non-culturable viruses and eliminates safety risks by using bioprocesses that are more controlled with defined process components and a shorter process of production, which is very important in terms of responding to a pandemic [70,71]. A typical example of a recombinant vaccine is Recombivax, a hepatitis B recombinant DNA vaccine, which was the first to be licensed. In this vaccine, recombinant hepatitis surface antigen is expressed in a yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [25], in contrast to the original vaccine that was made by purifying HBV particles from infected blood [72]. Over the past decade, several new vaccines have been developed using recombinant technology. One common approach is reverse vaccinology, in which genome analysis is performed to identify a repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, surface exposed and conserved across multiple strains. \n\nThe most immunogenic epitopes are sequenced and evaluated for appropriateness for a vaccine formulation and then patented by a pharmaceutical company for commercialization. Recombinant vaccine technology will be key to future vaccine development considering the current outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral infections that are life-threatening and teratogenic, such as the Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. This is because the upstream process in recombinant vaccine technology is fast compared to cell culture and in egg production and does not require the handling of live virus and the accompanying expensive Biosafety containment equipment.",

The antigen that is presented on or delivered through any platform will dictate the specificity of the immune response and largely direct the durability and breadth of immunity. In the early days of the HIV epidemic, vaccine developers took a standard approach in vaccinology, focusing on the wild-type form of the viral surface proteins as the primary immunogens for development. It became clear that the genetic and antigenic variability of HIV, particularly its surface envelope glycoprotein, would preclude this strategy from being a successful one [11]. A more rational approach toward immunogen design eventually took hold, based on the structural resolution of key epitopes that were the target of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies, which in many viral pathogen models have been a strong correlate of protection.\n\nIn recent years, structural biology and reverse vaccinology have become powerful tools to influence antigen potency. These approaches optimize the immunogenicity of antigens by resolving the structural details of surface proteins as a way to engineer key epitopes as targets of the most potent neutralizing antibodies, particularly those identified after natural infection [12][13][14]. Much of the focus in rational vaccine design for enveloped viruses, like HIV, has been on stabilizing their surface class I fusion proteins in a prefusion conformation. By honing in on this region, vaccine designers have been able to improve the breadth of neutralization [15].\n\nOne application of this HIV vaccine design strategy was in scaffolding epitopes to elicit antibody responses against the membrane proximal external region of the envelope gp41 subunit [16]. In this approach, a broadly neutralizing epitope was positioned, in its native conformation, onto a heterologous protein scaffold. This translated into the stabilization of the envelope ectodomain in its trimeric prefusion conformation and the generation of the BG505 SOSIP.664 proteins that contain the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies [17,18]. The methods of reverse vaccinology have also been used to understand and improve upon modestly successful vaccine strategies-such as that observed in the seminal RV144 trial and its immune corre",

            "text": "Structural vaccinology was fundamental to generate stabilized pre-F trimers that preserved key epitopes in the proper conformation to elicit the most neutralizing activity in human sera [81,82]. Another example is the licensed 4-component vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) composed of three recombinant proteins and a bacterial membrane vesicle selected using a reverse vaccinology approach (Section 2.2) [13]. Structure-based design was subsequently used to generate a vaccine made of chimeric antigens, by retaining epitopes from two antigens (fHbp and PorA), thus potentiating its power to elicit functional humoral immune responses against MenB [83]. These two examples illustrate that structural vacci-nology can generate novel vaccine antigen candidates with improved characteristics for antibody-based strategies. \n\nThe potential improvement in the identification of antigenic determinants expressed on cancer cells enabled the design of therapeutic subunit vaccine to treat cancer [84][85][86]. Although the use of cancer vaccines awaits meaningful clinical benefits several tumorassociated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are currently largely validated and have been used to design promising molecular vaccines. Conjugation of these TACAs to proteins or the development of altered-self, i.e., more immunogenic, TACA analogues are examples of current strategies to make TACA-based vaccines able to break immune tolerance and elicit cancer antigen-specific antibodies [87].",

            "text": "The existence of species with an open pangenomes has a profound effect on the selection of potential vaccine candidates identified by a reverse vaccinology approach. Indeed, the accessory genome was found to be an important contributor to protein antigens (Mora et al. 2006) implying that, for many bacterial species, a protein-based universal vaccine would only be possible by including a combination of antigens from the core and the accessory genomes. \n\nThe pathogen population structure and dynamics became a key element of vaccine research, paving the way for a modern approach to vaccine discovery known as pangenomic reverse vaccinology (Donati et al. 2010;Mora et al. 2006; The Pangenome: A Data-Driven Discovery in Biology Budroni et al. 2011). The key principles of this approach, that expands the reverse vaccinology paradigm based on a single genome sequence (Rappuoli 2000), include reducing bias in isolate selection for genome sequencing (to the extent possible, e.g., carriage vs. invasive isolates, or commensal vs. pathogenic isolates) based on epidemiology, followed by defining the population genomic structure of the species, including its pangenome. \n\nReverse vaccinology pipelines are then applied to predict the antigenic potential of proteins based on a collection of desired (and undesired features) that they carry, for a recent review on reverse vaccinology pipelines, see Dalsass et al. (2019). Top-ranked vaccine candidate proteins can then be taken through the experimental portion of the vaccine development phase whereby their accessibility and antigenicity are assayed, for instance starting with antigen-based serological typing [for a review on this experimental phase and subsequent phases, please see (Del Tordello et al. 2017)]. \n\nIt should be noted that the actual transcription, translation, and exposure of a set of selected vaccine protein candidates may vary with the environment, including colonization or infection of various organs, and niches within these organs. The pangenome can inform on these specificities by including isolates with a propensity to target certain organs/niches vs. others (e.g., skin vs. throat isolates of group A Streptococcus).",

Following an introductory chapter by Ruth Arnon of the Weizmann Institute describing various vaccine strategies used against microbial diseases, Chapter 2 by Rino Rappuoli and his colleagues from Novartis Vaccines in Siena, gives a comprehensive overview of a new approach known as reverse vaccinology. This approach, introduced ten years ago, was called reverse vaccinology because it does not search for vaccine candidates by the classical approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and establishing which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response, but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatic analyses of entire bacterial genomes. In silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the antigens that the pathogen is able to express and this allows investigators to choose in a reverse manner, starting from the genome rather than from the organism, which potentially surface-exposed proteins should be further investigated. The surface proteins are expressed using high-throughput technologies and then tested for immunoreactivity with patient sera and in immunogenicity and protection studies. Chapter 2 also describes various techniques used in reverse vaccinology such as in silico antigen prediction, protein identification by mass spectrometry, high-throughput antigen generation, the use of animal models for testing protection efficacy and the methods used for testing the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. Compared to earlier approaches which were always restricted to only a small number of purified antigens, reverse vaccinology identifies hundreds of proteins as potential vaccine candidates and tests them for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Another advantage is that this strategy can be used with microorganisms that cannot be cultivated. One chapter of the book is devoted to the first successful application of this new approach, namely the development of a vaccine against Meningococcus B (Men B), the pathogen that causes 50% of meningococcal meningitis worldwide. From a total of 2158 predicted open reading frames in the genome, 570 were selected as being potentially surface-exposed and 350 were successfully cloned in E. coli and purified in sufficient amounts for immunizing mice. Analysis of the mouse sera revealed 90 previously unknown surface located proteins, 28",

            "text": "The outcome of the trials was that VRC01 was not able to protect against HIV-1 acquisition overall, but did result in a sieving of VRC01-resistant viruses, suggesting that VRC01 was able to prevent transmission of VRC01sensitive viruses. The implication is that one bNAb specificity will most likely not be enough to induce broad protection, and an effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to induce multiple neutralizing specificities. \n\nEnv protein structures are playing an increasingly important role in vaccine design efforts. Resolving protein structures at the atomic level is necessary to define the surfaces that are accessible for the immune system, to determine sites that are targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), to design immunogens that mimic the proteins found on viral surfaces and to stabilize the desirable conformations [24]. This approach follows from \"reverse vaccinology\" in which complete genome sequencing of a pathogen is used to select for surfaceexpressed proteins to be used in a vaccine [25]. The term \"reverse vaccinology\" was repurposed in 2002 to describe the utilization of antibodies to select or design antigens with the appropriate binding properties [26]. A next iteration, \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" involves the use of antibodies and highresolution structures for the design of vaccine antigens [27]. \n\nWhile these concepts are widely applied in the HIV-1 vaccine design field, such structure-based vaccine design approaches also accelerated the development of novel vaccines against other pathogens. An example includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for which vaccine development was accelerated when the crystal structure of the pre-fusion F glycoprotein was resolved, using the D25 neutralizing antibody (NAb) specific for the pre-fusion form [28,29]. Similar to HIV-1 Env and other class I viral fusion proteins, the RSV F glycoprotein is very unstable and transitions very easily to its postfusion conformation. The apex targeting D25 MAb stabilized the F glycoprotein in its pre-fusion conformation, resulting in the high-resolution pre-fusion structure of the protein. This structure allowed for the development of a recombinant prefusion-stabilized F glycoprotein [24,28].",

Reverse vaccinology is a revolutionary in silico data-based approach to vaccine development. The strategy involves the computational rational designing of chimeric vaccines via rigorous genome screening or analysis, followed by selecting putative antigens and epitopes with immunogenic capabilities. It has been widely used to develop chimeric vaccines even against non-cultivable pathogens whose whole genome sequence is available. Moreover, developing omics-based chimeric vaccines in a shorter time eliminates the hurdles of vaccine stockpiling for re-emerging diseases [32]. Figure 1 illustrates the in silico strategies to develop different types of chimeric vaccines. genetic regulatory sequence or protein-encoding sequence of one microbial strain with the corresponding genes of the same or other microbial strain [30]. Chimeric vaccines leverage the concept of cross-reactivity, where shared or conserved epitopes among related pathogens are targeted to generate a protective immune response against multiple pathogens in a single formulation. Additionally, these vaccines are rationally designed to selectively incorporate putative immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes for successful antigen presentation to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and further activation of B-cell-and Tcell-specific immune response [31]. The pre-eminence of chimeric vaccines over conventional vaccines with added advantages involves: Ease of storage and transportation; \u2022 Rapid and reproducible large-scale production.",

Please note that some exceptions may contradict this generalized comparisons and the first trials in the 1980s focused on the recombinant structural proteins of specific pathogens (Lasky et al. 1986;Hollingdale et al. 1987;van Wyke Coelingh et al. 1987). The knowledge of the biology of the pathogen, the main proteins involved in pathogenesis and highly conserved ones, and the immune mechanisms that should be elicited for protection and identification of protective antigens has enabled a rational design of the recombinant protein vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines are subunit vaccines that use only a small part of the pathogen and target immune response focused against few protective antigens. Thus, the composition of this type of vaccine can be well-defined and controlled. Since a single protein cannot replicate, the risk of having side effects is negligible (Nascimento and Leite 2012). That is the main advantage of using a single protein as a vaccine. However, there is a dark side to this concept. If applied alone, an antigen cannot provide an intrinsic \"danger signal\", and the vaccine will not elicit an adequate and longterm immunity (Bomford 1998;Beverley 2002). To elicit a vigorous immune response, a recombinant protein vaccine requires adjuvants, and often multiple doses are needed as well (Hansson et al. 2000). So, making an efficient recombinant protein vaccine can be a challenge (Table 1). Nowadays, there are various expression systems, each with its advantages and flaws, allowing the production of large-scale quantities of recombinant proteins. Which of the systems will be used depends on the desirable properties of the recombinant proteins as antigens: post-translational modifications, native",

            "text": "The vaccine is a biological agent that provides protective immunity against specific infectious diseases. Conventional vaccines can be produced from killed microorganisms, their toxins, or their surface proteins to induce specific immunity in a host. Vaccination enables the body to acquire protective immunity to eliminate the microorganisms related to the antigen that may be encountered in the future. The conventional approach involves typical antigen identification, beginning with the culture of pathogenic microorganisms in the laboratory, dissecting their component proteins, and then analyzing these proteins in vitro and in vivo, finally resulting in the characterization of target proteins that exhibit requisite protective immune responses. However, many pathogenic proteins are only transiently expressed in the infection process. Some pathogenic proteins are difficult to express in vitro and it is thus challenging to acquire sufficient quantities for vaccine production. To overcome these challenges, bioinformatics was first applied and used in vaccinology against Serogroup B meningococcus 54 by Masignani et al. 55 called reverse vaccinology. It uses the information of genomic sequences to find target antigens for new potential vaccines. A whole genome of pathogens can be screened using bioinformatics methods to search effective target antigens by a computational method 56 . The screened gene may feature potential antigenicity or code for critical proteins with immune cell epitopes, signal peptides, and extracellular localization 57 . A good vaccine target antigen such as outer membrane proteins can be selected and designed from these genes. Once the target antigen is selected, it can be expressed in vitro and examined in animal models treated with infection 58 . The use of bioinformatics to find vaccine target antigens is quick and efficient. Conventional approaches may need decades to decipher pathogenic antigens, immunity, and diseases. However, in silico methods can be implemented easily and quickly, allowing one to identify target antigens for analysis in only a few years 59 . Many programs make reverse vaccinology information more accessible. Vaxign (Vaccine Design) was created in 2008, a comprehensive program including vaccine target antigen prediction and analysis system according to the principle of reverse vaccinology. It was demonstrated to be efficient and accurate for predicting target antigen and completely public access use 60 . Another software, RANKPEP, is also used for predicting peptide binding.",

            "text": "Recently, sequencing of whole bacterial genomes has allowed the development of new approaches to vaccine development. The bioinformatics analysis of genomic data can now readily be used to predict surface proteins, which can then be screened to identify new vaccine antigens [22]. This genome-based approach to vaccine development, coined ''reverse vaccinology'' [23], places an emphasis on identifying and validating the immunoreactivity and protective efficacy of bacterial antigens for use as recombinant vaccines against pathogens of animals and humans using rational deductive methodologies. \n\nSubunit vaccines can be based on recombinant proteins, peptides or polysaccharides that have been shown to contain protective epitopes [1]. An example of a commercially available recombinant subunit vaccine is the Hib vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b. It contains a polysaccharide antigen conjugated to a carrier protein such as tetanus toxoid [24]. Conjugation to protein carriers enables induction of a T cell mediated immune response, even in children under two years of age [25,26]. A second generation acellular Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae subunit vaccine has been developed to include the five recombinant proteins, ApxII, TbpB, CsyL, OmlA(1) and OmlA(2) (PleuroStar APP). The vaccine confers some degree of crossprotection against all A. pleuropneumonia serotypes in pigs [18,27]. \n\nWe have used a range of bioinformatics analyses of the annotated P. multocida Pm70 genome [28] sequence and previously published experimental data to select genes encoding proteins likely to have vaccine potential [20]. Protective antigens are likely to be surface exposed or secreted by the bacteria and therefore accessible to the host immune system. On this basis we chose 71 proteins that were identified as predicted OM-associated or secreted proteins [20] to test for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy.",

            "text": "Traditionally, mapping of immunodominant B cell epitopes required identification of the whole protein first, followed by the assessment of its fragments for reactivity with antibodies. This approach to antigen discovery and epitope mapping is time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. Advances in Omics approaches, such as protein microarrays to map the reactivity of antibodies and T cells to antigens, availability of various databases related to host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, tools for structural analyses and computational capabilities for theoretical predictions have tremendously helped in antigen discovery [5][6][7]. In particular, the in silico analytical and predictive methods have greatly facilitated all aspects of biological research including vaccinology. The approach of reverse vaccinology has become an integral part of rational vaccine design. This involves computational mining and analysis of large datasets related to immune responses to pathogens, host-pathogen interactions and host and pathogens genomes to predict promising antigen candidates. This entails large-scale sampling of potential antigens and down selection based on affinity for the antibodies or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules for experimental validation. \n\nStructural vaccinology is another approach which is facilitating rational design of better antigens. The availability of structures of viral proteins as well as antigen-antibody complexes has made it possible to carry out docking and modeling studies for prediction of B cell epitopes. This approach has been used to develop strongly immunogenic vaccine candidates from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) glycoprotein and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus spike protein [8,9]. High-throughput in vitro assays combined with structure-function analyses have been successfully used to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against influenza HA stalk, HIV V2 and V3 glycans and Dengue envelope protein [10][11][12]. Structural information of bNAbs-antigen complexes has been used to graft linear as well as discontinuous HIV epitopes on to computationally designed scaffolds to develop designer antigens [13,14]. NGS-based profiling of antibody repertoire induced by such antigens can help in identification of bNAbs and improved antigens.",

            "text": "Similarly, in heifers bred with infected bulls, two commercial vaccines revealed no significant efficacy [15]. Vaccine failures have been related to surface antigenic variation of Cfv or the existence of diversity in surface antigens among regional strains [15]. \n\nVaccines against pathogens evolved from incorporating whole organisms (e.g. bacterins) to recombinant vaccines, including multi-epitope vaccines, which are composed of highly antigenic peptides capable of eliciting an effective immune response [16]. Whereas the traditional methods for vaccine development are expensive and time-consuming, the recently emerged reverse vaccinology technology and bioinformatic tools have significantly reduced the time and cost of vaccine development [17]. A new generation of vaccines arose from these novel strategies based on analysis of pathogen's genome and identification of proteins with favourable characteristics to be used as vaccine targets [18]. In fact, several vaccines with promising results have been developed against other Campylobacter species, using reverse vaccinology approaches [19,20]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this approach was not described to develop a vaccine against Cfv. Therefore, this study aimed to identify potential vaccine targets and design a multi-epitope vaccine against Cfv for the control of BGC, using a reverse vaccinology approach.",

Example of \"second generation\" vaccines includes vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, anthrax, pneumonia, influenza, hepatitis B, and Lyme disease (9). The transition from vaccinology 1.0 to vaccinology 2.0 has been made possible by several technological advancements, including genetic and protein engineering, recombinant DNA (11), polysaccharide and carbohydrate chemistry, combinatorial chemistry (12), among others.\n\nVaccinology 3.0 starts from the microbial genomic sequences (reverse vaccinology 1.0) or from the repertoire of protective human antibodies (reverse vaccinology 2.0) (13,14). This shift has been possible thanks to omics data, which represent one type of Big Data, characterized by different aspects, such as enormous volume, velocity, and high variety of data (15).\n\nHigh-throughput technologies-enabled omics disciplines [such as genomics and post-genomics specialties (16,17), includ ing transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, cytomics, immunomics, secretomics, surfomics, or interactomics], briefly overviewed in Table 1, are able to produce a wealth of data and information, at a large-scale. Recently, these approaches have converged in what is termed vaccinomics, that is, to say the performance of large-scale, hypothesis-free, data-driven and holistic investigations. Poland and collaborators have defined vaccino mics as the \"integration of immunogenetics and immunogenomics with systems biology and immune profiling\" (18).\n\nNew cutting-edge technologies include next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques [RNASeq (19) and large-scale Band T-cell receptor sequencing (20,21)], mass cytometry (CyTOF) (22), and peptide/protein arrays (23). Data produced by molecular biology and NGS as well as by bioinformatics (24) can be used to perform mechanistic reductionist studies but can be also exploited to comprehensively capture immune dynamics and interactions (25), carrying out, for instance, network analysis or systems",

            "text": "In vaccine development, genomics studies have dual functions of identifying protective antigens and elucidating the underlying mechanisms of immune protection induced by vaccination. Several\u201a approaches have been used for the search of immunogenic proteins for viral and bacterial vaccines. In the case of viral vaccines, reverse genetics have been used for the identification of immunogenic proteins for IPNV [74], peptide scanning for NNV [75] and IPNV [76], phage display for infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) [77] and IHNV [78] while bioinformatics has been used to identify immunogenic proteins for SGIV [79]. The search of bacterial immunogenic proteins is mostly centered on identifying antigens that provide protective immunity across variant serotypes of the same bacterial species. Wang et al. [80] used the tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling-based quantitative proteomics to identify the most immunogenic outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of A. hydrophila. Another approach used for bacterial vaccines is the in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT), which has been widely used for the selection of antigens for different bacterial species such as Edwardsiella tarda [81], A. salmonicida [82] and Streptococcus iniae [83]. Taken together, these advances play an important role in the design of genetically engineered vaccines encoding immunogenic proteins in heterologous vectors used in the production of DNA, fusion protein and subunit recombinant vaccines. Apart from genetically engineered vaccines, genomic studies have also been used for the identification of avirulent strains for use as live attenuated vaccines as shown by Zhang et al. [84] who used Illumina sequencing for the characterization of attenuated strains of Streptococcus agalactiae with the potential to serve as a live vaccine. \n\nIn fish vaccinology, transcriptome studies are being used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying vaccine protection.",

One of the focuses of this field involves the structural and functional studies of genetic materials and to perform in silico analysis [18,19]. This scope of bioinformatics will be helpful in vaccine production, as bioinformatic tools will help to reduce the time in the antigen and the epitope selection process [18,20]. It has to be highlighted that bioinformatic tools used in this technology are only used in vaccine designing and selection process. The rest of the vaccine production does involve the conventional methods in the manufacturing. One of the prominent roles of bioinformatics tool in vaccine design is predicting the reactivity of the antibody epitope in the immune response and led to an efficient vaccine manufacturing process. This technology could be applied in plantibody and revolutionized the manufacturing process of plantibodies [20]. \n\nReverse vaccinology is one of the widely utilized approach in the vaccine designing. Reverse vaccinology is a technique where bioinformatic tools would be used to design the vaccine by selecting the specific antigen or peptides required to induce immune response [18,21,22]. These selected peptide or antigen would be tested in mice to validate and further analyze the efficiency of the peptide or antigen [21]. Once the peptide or antigen is finalized, it can be incorporated into plant genome to produce plant-based vaccines. It is crucial that the genome sequence of the studied virus to be available to perform this technique. Reverse vaccinology saves a lot of time in vaccine production and allows to screen all multiple peptides at once to ease the selection process [18,21].",

            "text": "A key aspect of non-viral vaccine development involves the selection of antigens that can effectively elicit a protective immune response. Whereas traditional vaccines are generally developed through attenuation or inactivation of pathogens and through the incorporation of few selected antigens as vaccine components, new technologies have recently been applied toward antigen discovery and design. For example, \"reverse vaccinology\" refers to the ability to screen the complete antigen sets based on whole-genome sequencing of pathogens for the ability to induce protective antibody responses. Combinations of reverse vaccinology and traditional vaccine approaches allow for an efficient development of immunogenic vaccine candidates (74,75). \n\nBioinformatic tools have contributed greatly to vaccine design and evaluation in recent years. Computational approaches are continually improving in their ability to predict T and B-cell epitopes from the complete antigen pools and to rationally design antigens with potential long-lasting protective immunity. Such algorithms calculate antigen-antibody interaction energies and structures (76) that increasingly bridge modeling based on existing templates and free-modeling based on heterologous structures and database consensus design (77). Deep sequencing combined with computational analysis allows for thoroughly characterizing the B cell repertoire in survivors of disease to identify the protective immunity (78). \n\nA computationally designed antigen found to be protective in animal models was first reported for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F antigen in 2013 (79). Many challenging vaccine targets have since been developed rationally for HIV (80)(81)(82), hepatitis C (83,84), herpes (85), Zika (86,87), RSV (82), HPV (88), as well as for bacteria (82,89), fungi (90), and cancers (91). Rational vaccine design has also been utilized to improve VLP and NP vaccines by selecting a repetitive and predictive protein backbone structure for enhanced antigen presentation (92). Finally, rational antigen design is being explored for activation of dendritic cells (93) such as targeting C-type lectin receptors to activate antigen presentation in the context of the pathogens (e.g., Ebola and HIV) (94).",

            "text": "Future vaccines will be minimalistic in approach by focusing on key parts of the pathogen, such as regions containing epitopes that cover antigenic diversity and, thus, will target immunologically similar subgroups of the human population and multiple pathogen variants. This is evident from the trend observed in evolution of vaccine strategies, which has seen a shift from whole organisms to recombinant proteins, and further towards the ultimate in minimalist vaccinology, the peptide/epitope/multiepitope based vaccines. The minimalist approach is also expected to cover the safety concerns that are associated with the traditional vaccine approach of using whole organism (Sette and Fikes, 2003;Dertzbaugh, 1998). Vectored vaccines, suitable for 'combination immunization' that are produced by recombinant DNA technology and contain multivalent minimal antigens to protect against multiple infections, are considered to be the future of vaccinology (Kutzler and Weiner, 2008). The future will bring increased integration of vaccine research with advances in immunology, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, informatics, and high-throughput instrumentation, collective defined as the emerging field of \"vaccinomics\", which is hailed to be responsible for the next 'golden age' in vaccinology (Poland et al., 2008). Awareness of the novel technological possibilities in vaccine research is also expected to grow. Future vaccinology will be based on detailed understanding of immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses (using adjuvants) and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets (Brusic et al., 2005). To achieve this, vaccine development will routinely be conducted through large-scale functional studies supported by genomics, proteomics, and informatics techniques prior to clinical trials. This will provide an increased range of immune targets for vaccine design. The author expects the emergence of new generation of vaccines to be personalised to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the disease agents. In summary, vaccinology will experience rapid progress and will eventually deliver benefits to patients from improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.",

            "text": "Despite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens, not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms. Advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches, which may be employed in new generation vaccines. Structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines [135]. As mentioned previously, RSV remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity. Since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab, currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to RSV infection, considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the RSV fusion (F) protein and optimizing F expression constructs for higher immunogenicity [105]. Current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of RSV F protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab [136,137]. The availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines, for which no current vaccines exist.\n\nAdvances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science. The capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of RNA virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design. We have described here RNA virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human RNA virus pathogens. The incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology, adjuvants, non-human models of infection, and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not. Ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines. Despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation, the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same: high efficacy, safety, and stability.",

            "text": "The latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204]. \n\nIn a pilot study, Oprea et al. employed a simplified reverse vaccinology approach to identify S. aureus candidate epitopes that induce both B-and T-cell mediated immunity [205]. Instead of starting with the whole bacterial genome, they selected ten conserved surface exposed proteins for antigenicity testing and identified epitopes from fibronectin binding protein A (FnbpA), collagen adhesion (Cna), serine-rich adhesin for platelets (SraP) and elastine binding protein (EbpS) as putative targets. These, however, still need to be validated [205]. In empirical vaccinology, infection-relevant S. aureus antigens can be comprehensively mapped using transcriptomics and proteomics. In parallel, immunoproteomics provides a panoramic view of the intensity and dynamics of antibody binding to S. aureus proteins revealing their immunogenicity. Moreover, omics technologies can aid the characterization of the T-cell response to S. aureus in its full complexity. These empirical approaches will lead to the discovery of promising S. aureus vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology is a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens. First, the whole S. aureus genome is mined for potential B-and T-cell epitopes using computer-based algorithms. Next, candidate antigens are produced as recombinant proteins and purified. These antigens as well as those that have been identified empirically are then used for vaccination in pre-clinical infection models and assayed for their ability to mediate protection. Promising candidate vaccines will then be subjected to clinical trials (not shown). Hence, omics technologies are versatile tools empowering both empirical and in-silico-based vaccine development.",

See Figure 2. Conventional laboratory-based, experimental microbiological approaches to antigen identification typically start with the cultivation of the target pathogenic micro-organism under laboratory conditions, then dissecting them into their component proteins, assaying these in some cascade of in vitro and in vivo assays, leading ultimately to the identification of proteins which display requisite protective immunity. It would indeed be wonderful if the identification of candidate vaccines was really and consistently this simple and systematic? Unfortunately, it is often so much more complex, confusing, and confounding. It is not always possible to cultivate a particular pathogen outside of the host organism. Many proteins are only expressed transiently during the course of infection. Nor are all proteins easily expressed in sufficient quantities in vitro. Thus many potential candidate vaccines may be missed. \n\nReverse vaccinology [7][8][9][10] is, by contrast, able to analyze a genome to identify potential antigens. Initially, the pathogenic genome is scanned for \"open reading frames\" or ORFs. Once all ORFs have been identified, proteins are selected on the basis that they will be accessible to immune system surveillance, usually using some form of informatic-based prediction methodology or, more likely, set of methdologies. Reverse vaccinology was established by a group studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for sepsis and meningococcal meningitis. Vaccines are available for all serotypes except subgroup B. Potential ORFs in N. meningitidis genome were identified [11] [12]; 570 proteins were identified, 350 expressed in vitro, and 85 were surface exposed. Seven proteins conferred immunity over a broad range of strains. \n\nAnother good example is Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis [13] [14]. 130 potential ORFs were identified, 108 of which could be expressed; six proteins were found to induce protection.",

            "text": "In less than a century, the vaccines developed using Pasteur's original rules of 'isolate, inactivate and inject the microorganism' led to the elimination of some of the most devastating infectious diseases globally. The majority of existing vaccines were developed either using such conventional means, that is, by attenuation of the pathogen by serial passage in vitro to generate live-attenuated strains that retain immunogenicity but are no longer pathogenic; or by identification of protective antigens for use in nonliving, subunit vaccines [28,29]. For the latter, arduous and costly biochemical methods have traditionally been used to purify antigens from organisms grown in culture, resulting in small numbers of proteins ultimately being tested for immunogenicity, with limited account for existing evidence of naturally occurring protection against these antigens [30]. Since the end of the 20th century, new technologies have been proposed to address vaccines against other pathogens for which previous methods have failed. A remarkable discovery was the whole-genome sequence of H. influenzae [31], which then allowed moving beyond Pasteur's rules to investigation of pathogen genomes to inform vaccine design. \n\nReverse vaccinology is a relatively recent research discipline in which pathogen sequences have been utilized to predict antigenic proteins exposed on the surface of the pathogen, which can then be tested experimentally. Genome-wide sequencing has been utilized to detect potential antigenic sites in Group B meningococci -responsible for 50% of meningococcal sepsis and meningitis worldwide [31]. This bacterium had been refractory to vaccine development, because its capsular polysaccharide (polysialic acid) is nonimmunogenic (because it is expressed by several human tissues and hence is effectively a self-antigen to which the human immune system is tolerant). With the reverse vaccinology approach, 600 putative antigens were discovered, of which 29 were shown to induce antibodies that kill the bacterium in vitro via complement-mediated mechanisms. Today, five of these antigens have been inserted into a prototype vaccine (plus outer membrane vesicle component), which is completing phase III clinical trials [32].",

            "text": "A revolutionary diversion from classical vaccinology to reverse vaccinology approach has been observed in the last decade. The ever-increasing genomic and proteomic data has greatly facilitated the vaccine designing and development process. Reverse vaccinology is considered as a cost-effective and proficient approach to screen the entire pathogen genome. To look for broad-spectrum immunogenic targets and analysis of closely-related bacterial species, the assimilation of pangenome concept into reverse vaccinology approach is essential. The categories of species pangenome such as core, accessory, and unique genes sets can be analyzed for the identification of vaccine candidates through reverse vaccinology. We have designed an integrative computational pipeline term as \u201cPanRV\u201d that employs both the pangenome and reverse vaccinology approaches. PanRV comprises of four functional modules including i) Pangenome Estimation Module (PGM) ii) Reverse Vaccinology Module (RVM) iii) Functional Annotation Module (FAM) and iv) Antibiotic Resistance Association Module (ARM). The pipeline is tested by using genomic data from 301 genomes of Staphylococcus aureus and the results are verified by experimentally known antigenic data. The proposed pipeline has proved to be the first comprehensive automated pipeline that can precisely identify putative vaccine candidates exploiting the microbial pangenome. PanRV is a Linux based package developed in JAVA language. An executable installer is provided for ease of installation along with a user manual at https://sourceforge.net/projects/panrv2/.",

They coined the term \"reverse vaccinology\" to describe this novel approach that starts with the genome rather than a laboratory grown pathogen. As it is not feasible to evaluate all of the thousands of proteins encoded in a genome, a process was developed to screen for proteins that were likely to be exposed on the surface of the target microorganism. It was based on the prediction of protein structural features, such as: integral transmembrane \u03b2-barrel arrangements; transmembrane alpha-helices; signal peptides; lipoprotein lipoboxes; and secreted proteins. The original bioinformatics software and recent advances applicable to RV have been reviewed extensively elsewhere; see, e.g., [67,68]. This provided a rigorous analysis and the identification of candidate antigens for subsequent evaluation in the laboratory. The technique was originally proposed almost 20 years ago, and the first vaccine discovered using the RV process was licensed in Europe in 2012. Appropriately, it was the 4CMenB vaccine for the control of meningococcal B disease, now marketed worldwide as Bexsero by GlaxoSmithKline [63]. The reverse vaccinology process (RV) has been applied to a diverse range of infectious diseases including: malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniosis and leptospirosis. However, the success of the approach requires, in addition to a genome sequence, a high-throughput cloning strategy, an animal model and in vitro screening assays to rapidly evaluate the potentially hundreds of vaccine candidates identified during the bioinformatics step. The RV process is summarized as applied to Leptospira spp.; see Figure 2.",

Immunoprotomics, as discussed in Section 7.5, is also known as 'reversed vaccinology' and has recently been successfully used for the development of a recombinant vaccine against A. hydrophila for carp (Poobalane, 2007). Other technologies with the same approach are knockout technologies, which indicate whether specifi c antigens are essential or important for survival of the pathogen in the host. These methods have great potential for the future and include RNA interference where expression of certain genes is blocked by antisense RNA (Melamed et al., 2002), in vivo expression technologies, IVET (Rainey and Preston, 2000), and signature tagged mutagenesis (Saenz and Dehio, 2005). The information obtained from a variety of these techniques is combined with data from existing literature to identify potential vaccine candidate antigens for cloning and for recombinant expression (Adams et al., 2005). \n\nDelivery of DNA vaccines using bacteriophages has been reported to be successful in a number of animals including fi sh (Skurnik and Strauch, 2006). The phage particles used are non-infectious and only grow on specialised laboratory strains of bacteria; the phage coat protects the vaccine from degradation and allows the host's immune system to process it more effi ciently (March et al., 2004;Clark and March, 2006). This technology may be extremely useful for oral delivery of DNA vaccines for fi sh. \n\nGene sequencing underpins many of the new technologies being developed both for diagnostics and vaccine development and, as gene sequences become available for both pathogens and the host fi sh species, microarrays can be developed. These will enable very rapid progress to be made in fi sh health control for the future.",

            "text": "All the clinical vaccines mentioned above and in Table 2 have used well-known virulence factors as antigens in subunit vaccines. In general, subunit vaccines are safer and have a lower side effect profile compared to other vaccine types [93]. Discovery of novel conserved bacterial antigens is vital to continue investigating new immunisation approaches against P. aeruginosa. By using various bioinformatics screens alongside wholegenome sequencing data, researchers can use reverse vaccinology to identify desirable antigens for use in vaccines. Typically, those antigens which are abundantly expressed, highly conserved and immunogenic epitopes, and surface-exposed are most useful as vaccine candidates [94]. \n\nA small number of studies have used reverse vaccinology to identify unique antigens in P. aeruginosa. Rashid et al. first uncovered nine novel candidates, including three uncharacterized hypothetical proteins which may provide the basis of a subunit vaccine [95]. The presence of other components of known virulence factors, including surface components of antibiotic efflux pumps, T3SS and proteins on the bacterial cell wall, validates their approach. Using reverse vaccinology and additional bioinformatic tools, Bianconi and colleagues identified 52 total potential candidates which were conserved in P. aeruginosa strains of varying origin and in clinical isolates from CF patients [96]. The top ten antigens were used in vivo in a murine model of acute pneumonia in 22 separate combinations. The study concluded that combinations of candidate antigens provided the best protection. This strategy of using multiple antigens has been used in previous clinical vaccines [50,63], but should undergo further investigation. Additional reverse vaccinology approaches have identified numerous candidate antigens which are yet to undergo in vivo assessment [97,98]. \n\nA Th17-based reverse vaccinology study using a select library of outer membrane and secreted proteins identified PopB, a highly conserved component of the T3SS [99]. PopB elicited Th17 responses and IL-17 production and increased bacterial clearance in lethal P. aeruginosa murine pneumonia in an antibody-independent manner. \n\nTo further enhance antigen discovery, methods to identify novel antigens stimulating mechanisms of cellular immunity ought to be tried.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a genome-based approach for vaccine development that differs to the traditional methods of vaccine design, which utilizes killed or attenuated pathogens such as the measles vaccine [14]. Indeed, the term \"reverse\" refers to the identification of specific genes among the whole pathogen genome to be selected and expressed as recombinant proteins for the implementation of the vaccine. Anyway, among all the proteins, only specific epitopes can be recognized by the host immune system [15,16] and their identification is one the main problems and limitations in vaccine development. In this sense, RV integrates immunological information to rationally select the most attractive antigens for further studies [17]. In this way, it is possible to select proteins that efficiently stimulate the immune response: an essential prerequisite for the development of effective vaccines [18]. \n\nTraditional approaches have limitations that are bypassed by RV. For example, the number of identified antigens, usually limited with biochemical methods, is overcome by RV while taking into account every putative antigen during the preliminary analysis. Another example is the antigen variability among strains and species that RV is able to reduce by selecting the most conserved genome sequences [17]. Finally, costs and speed of vaccine production need to be considered during the design, since they are important limitations for vaccine development and distribution, for example, in the case of an emergency, as evidenced by the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\nNotably, RV is a time-saving approach; it avoids the necessity to grow the pathogens for the analysis in exchange of an often faster production of recombinant proteins. Finally, modern high-throughput computational analysis tools allow the development of powerful vaccines with different antigens against one pathogen, but also broad-spectrum vaccines that exploit the same antigen against different pathogens [18][19][20]. \n\nNevertheless, reverse vaccinology, as well as structural vaccinology, have some limitations. Among these, RV cannot identify carbohydrate-based antigens, which are common protective antigens of pathogens. Another important drawback of RV is that it depends on the genomes of the analyzed organisms and on the software (and equations) utilized.",

            "text": "In the co-evolution of pathogens and host immune systems, pathogens with immune evasion mechanisms have been reported, including influenza A virus (IAV) [23], SARS-CoV-2 [24], Streptococcus pneumoniae [25], and herpes simplex virus 1 [26]. We proposed earlier that genomic variability and post-translational protein modification enhance the immune evasion of Mhp [5], which limits the general applicability of commercial vaccines. On the other hand, reverse vaccinology has been developed for a rapid and effective vaccine development pipeline in recent studies, and a variety of candidate vaccines against viruses, parasites, and bacteria have been reported. In the reverse vaccinology pipeline, pan-genome analysis can find ubiquitous antigens within different strains. The selected immunodominant antigens only account for 1% of all core proteins in this study. In another study, this proportion was also very low (2212 core proteins and 4 immunodominant antigens in Klebsiella pneumoniae), which indicates that the pipeline for candidate antigen selection is strict [27]. These antigens can be used for epitope selection and can also serve as candidate immunogens for genetically engineered vaccines. \n\nThe steps for epitope selection in this study mainly included selecting B-cell, MHC-II binding, and MHC-I binding epitopes. These processes were rapid, and, to improve the accuracy, more than one prediction or identification method was used. The final vaccine was a combination of conserved epitopes rather than subunit proteins, and the results of multiple sequence alignments of epitopes and their homologous sequences in different Mhp strains are shown in Supplementary File S1. Although some epitopes had amino acid mutations, the frequency of these mutations was relatively low. These properties may enable a multi-epitope vaccine to induce universal antibodies against the selected antigens and overcome the immune evasion of Mhp.",

Recombinant proteins have been used as drugs for decades [31][32][33][34] and their intrinsic clinical safety and industrial scalability in their production have been largely demonstrated. In addition, the functional and structural versatility of polypeptides allow designing presentations as multimeric, nanoscale materials in which self-assembling is achieved through several alternative approaches [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]. This set of properties make them excellent candidates for new generation approaches in contemporary vaccinology. In addition, novel natural or engineered cell factories with appealing properties have been incorporated in the last decades to the biofabrication of protein drugs [44], beyond the more classical bacterial and yeast species and mammalian and insect cells. In the present review, we discuss the contemporary approaches in the biological fabrication of recombinant subunit vaccines from alternative cell factories and how these antigens are adapted to comply with the requirements for vaccine effectiveness regarding stability, formulation and multivalent nanoscale presentation.",

            "text": "Vaccination is the most effective method of disease prevention and control. Many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and diphtheria) are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs. Nonetheless, vaccine manufacturing remains incredibly challenging. Viruses exhibiting high antigenic diversity and high mutation rates cannot be fairly contested using traditional vaccine production methods and complexities surrounding the manufacturing processes, which impose significant limitations. Virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) are recombinantly produced viral structures that exhibit immunoprotective traits of native viruses but are noninfectious. Several VLPs that compositionally match a given natural virus have been developed and licensed as vaccines. Expansively, a plethora of studies now confirms that VLPs can be designed to safely present heterologous antigens from a variety of pathogens unrelated to the chosen carrier VLPs. Owing to this design versatility, VLPs offer technological opportunities to modernize vaccine supply and disease response through rational bioengineering. These opportunities are greatly enhanced with the application of synthetic biology, the redesign and construction of novel biological entities. This review outlines how synthetic biology is currently applied to engineer VLP functions and manufacturing process. Current and developing technologies for the identification of novel target\u2010specific antigens and their usefulness for rational engineering of VLP functions (e.g., presentation of structurally diverse antigens, enhanced antigen immunogenicity, and improved vaccine stability) are described. When applied to manufacturing processes, synthetic biology approaches can also overcome specific challenges in VLP vaccine production. Finally, we address several challenges and benefits associated with the translation of VLP vaccine development into the industry.",

            "text": "A new era in vaccine design is started through the use of the bacterial genomes to discover new vaccine candidates. \"in silico\" prediction tools are applied to identify genes encoding for surface-exposed or secreted antigens. Newly discovered antigens are expressed in E. coli as recombinant proteins, and their immunogenicity evaluated in preclinical models (86). This approach, named \"reverse vaccinology\" has allowed the development of the first multivalent protein-based vaccine against meningococcus B, 4CMenB, that is now approved in many countries worldwide. In addition to the recombinant proteins identified by the reverse vaccinology approach, the licensed 4CMenB vaccine contains the highly immunogenic outer membrane vesicles (OMV) component produced through detergent extraction (87). The same OMV component has been used in New Zealand to fight a MenB outbreak. An immunization campaign was implemented in all population starting from 5 weeks to 20 years of age in the period 2004-2006 (64,88,89). Interestingly, by using genetic approaches, it is possible to induce an over-blebbing phenotype without using detergents leading to a new generation of improved bacterial OMVs called generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMAs). The vesicles are obtained by mutation in genes responsible for stabilizing the link between the bacterial outer membrane and peptidoglycan (e.g., tolR, tolB, nlpl). GMMAs can also be further engineered by targeting genes responsible for LPS acetylation, such as lpxlM and lpxL1 therefore reducing LPS reactogenicity (90). Yet, another class of vaccines proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines is based on nanoparticles. \n\nIn this regard, thanks to advancement in structural biology the rational design of molecule structures with desired size, shape, stability, improved immunogenicity and functionality became feasible (91). Nanoparticles were initially discovered in virus such as those from Hepatitis B. Once produced recombinantly these particles were found to be composed either of the surface antigen (HBsAg) or the core antigen (HBcAg).",

            "text": "The beginning of the 21st century has already seen new vaccines licensed and become available due to the development of novel approaches. Novel technologies, such as the virus-like particles, have allowed the development of vaccines against HPV (Siddiqui & Perry, 2006;Keam & Harper, 2008). Reverse vaccinology, through mining of genome sequences for high-throughput antigen discovery, has successfully allowed the development of a novel multicomponent recombinant vaccine against meningococcus type B (Giuliani et al, 2006). The first therapeutic vaccine based on blood cell infusion has been licensed for prostate cancer (Plosker, 2011). Several tools have been developed and in some cases already tested in human trials, which will greatly support the discovery and rational design of novel vaccines against difficult targets such as HIV, malaria, TB, dengue, and S. aureus, where conventional technologies have failed. The hope is that, thanks to these technologies, more infectious diseases will be preventable by vaccinating children, adolescents, adults and elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised subjects. Novel vectors and adjuvants may also allow the development of therapeutic vaccines to treat different forms of cancer, chronic infections, and other inflammatory disorders. The development of innovative immunization regimes and novel delivery technologies provides unprecedented means to not just augment but to shape the immune responses. What the experiences of recent clinical trials have taught us is that while the quantity or magnitude of immune responses is important, the quality or flavor of these responses is equally important, and predicting immunogenicity does not necessarily translate into predicting protection. For many of the elusive targets in vaccine development, one of the most challenging gaps to fill is that of identifying biomarkers or correlates of protection. An immediate goal we should set is to exploit the trials undertaken to date, in the attempt to identify signatures of vaccine efficacy that can guide early selection of the most promising vaccine candidates for the future. Understanding what responses are desirable and necessary for protection and how they can be induced by a vaccine will unlock the door to rationally designing effective next-generation vaccines.",

The first attempts of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur to develop attenuated smallpox and rabies vaccines were soon followed by the discovery that immunization with toxoids or inactivated microorganisms protected against diphtheria, tetanus or whooping cough. Recently, the development of cell culture and recombinant DNA technologies has allowed the design of vaccines against a variety of bacteria and viruses [56]. The 21st century has projected novel technologies such as reverse vaccinology, which has resulted in vaccines against type B meningitis, or the recent advent of adenoviral vectors or mRNA vaccines [57]. \n\nIn this study, we propose a complementary approach through the use of attenuated vaccines as bacterial factories to produce the immunogenic constituents of other proof-of-concept vaccines. This approach is limited to live attenuated vaccines such as the typhoid vaccine, the TB vaccine BCG, or BCG-replacement strategies such as MTBVAC. The development of live vaccine factories opens interesting perspectives in terms of multivalent immunization, persistent presentation of the antigen to the immune system, or its preparation as lyophilized formulations. In addition to health benefits, the combination of multiple immunizations in a single vaccine allows lower costs in terms of production, distribution and personnel required for administration. We should also remember that live TB vaccines confer a plethora of beneficial, nonspecific effects [58] such as protecting against unrelated pathogens [18,22] through priming trained immunity [59] or enhancing the immunity of unrelated vaccines [31]. Taken together, these heterologous effects of live TB vaccines together with the potential to construct recombinant derivatives open exciting perspectives for nextgeneration vaccine strategies.",

To date several types of vaccines are available, including live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit or split, toxoid, conjugate, DNA, and recombinant vectored vaccines [2]. While conventional vaccines, like live-attenuated or inactivated wild-type, have successfully protected vaccinees from various infectious diseases over the years, they are not available for most infectious diseases and for those who cannot afford them.\n\nConventional vaccine production methods, which predominantly use viruses and bacteria or their products, produced with classical production methods, are labour intensive, expensive, and time consuming, while some of the desired antigens cannot be produced in this way [3]. Furthermore, highly virulent pathogens can only be produced under expensive special safety conditions, while attenuated agents may have a tendency of reverting to their pathogenic form and can usually only be used in fully competent individuals [4].\n\nTo overcome the challenges of traditional vaccine production, the development and use of novel generations of vaccines, like those based on GM technologies, are being considered more and more frequently. The advent of these novel technologies may also be expected to create opportunities for the development of vaccines targeting new indications and/or application fields. Since there are many major indications for which no or only unsatisfactory vaccines are available, like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, the exploitation of novel technologies, like the use of vector-based vac-cine candidates or vector-based production of protective antigens, may eventually allow us to fill the gap of this unmet medical need. To date several vaccines for humans, based on GM technologies have been licensed (for review see e.g. [5][6][7][8]) and a lot of candidates are in the pipeline.\n\nAn interesting approach for vaccine development based on GM technology is the use of vectors, which carry selected genes encoding antigens that induce protective immunity. They can either be used as vaccines proper, or for the production of antigens that are incorporated in vaccines. The present paper only",

Sophisticated techniques and rapidly growing in-depth knowledge of immunological mechanisms are at hand to exploit fully the potential for protecting from, as well as curing of diseases through vaccination. In spite of great successes like eradication of smallpox in the 1970s and in a lesser extent poliomyelitis (two important milestones in medical history), new challenges have arisen to be faced. Rapidly changing ecosystems and human behaviour, an ever-increasing density of human and farmed animal populations, a high degree of mobility resulting in rapid spreading of pathogens in infected people and animals, poverty and war confl icts in the third world, and many other factors contribute to the more frequent occurrence and rapid dissemination of new as well as some old infectious disease. \n\nThe three infections that most heavily affl ict global health are AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. As an example of new viral pathogens, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, or new strains of infl uenza virus can be mentioned [ 1 ]. Rapid sequencing of the genome of pathogens leads to development of sensitive molecular diagnostic tools and augments identifi cation and expression of recombinant antigenic targets for future vaccines [ 2 ]. Special fi eld represents immunotherapy of cancer, where anticancer vaccines could be a powerful weapon for long-term effective treatment. \n\nThe progress in vaccine development is tightly connected not only with new fi ndings in immunology but also in molecular biology and biotechnology. The new term \"reverse vaccinology\" was proposed by Rappuoli to describe a complex genome-based approach toward vaccine design [ 3 ]. In comparison with conventional approaches which require a laborious process of attenuation or inactivation of pathogens, or selection of individual components important for induction of immune response, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility of using genomic information derived from in silico analyses for direct design and production of protective antigen using recombinant technology.",

            "text": "The best way to prevent diseases caused by pathogens is by the use of vaccines. The advent of genomics enables genome-wide searches of new vaccine candidates, called reverse vaccinology. The most common strategy to apply reverse vaccinology is by designing subunit recombinant vaccines, which usually generate an humoral immune response due to B-cell epitopes in proteins. A major problem for this strategy is the identification of protective immunogenic proteins from the surfome of the pathogen. Epitope mimicry may lead to auto-immune phenomena related to several human diseases. A sequence-based computational analysis has been carried out applying the BLASTP algorithm. Therefore, two huge databases have been created, one with the most complete and current linear B-cell epitopes, and the other one with the surface-protein sequences of the main human respiratory bacterial pathogens. We found that none of the 7353 linear B-cell epitopes analysed shares any sequence identity region with human proteins capable of generating antibodies, and that only 1% of the 2175 exposed proteins analysed contain a stretch of shared sequence with the human proteome. These findings suggest the existence of a mechanism to avoid autoimmunity. We also propose a strategy for corroborating or warning about the viability of a protein linear B-cell epitope as a putative vaccine candidate in a reverse vaccinology study; so, epitopes without any sequence identity with human proteins should be very good vaccine candidates, and the other way around.",

            "text": "The use of native antigens has proven remarkably successful against a wide range of pathogens, but not against all agents for which vaccines are needed. The pathogens for which we have successful vaccines share certain characteristics. They are, in general, agents against which humoral immunity is protective, and their surface antigens do not vary more quickly than new variants can be incorporated into updated vaccines. Examples include diphtheria, poliovirus, and hepatitis B virus, which have not undergone significant antigenic change over many decades [5]. \n\nThe pathogens against which traditional techniques have not been successful also share certain characteristics. One of these characteristics is a lack of highly expressed surface antigens that are suitable for use as vaccine components. For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity [6]. Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus [7] and group B streptococcus [8]. Reverse vaccinology vaccine candidates for Staphylococcus aureus [9] and meningococcus B [10,11] are now in clinical trials. \n\nVaccines against the most refractory pathogens will require different solutions. For example, most viruses do not encode as-yet undiscovered protective antigens. HIV and hepatitis C virus vary their surface antigens so rapidly and extensively that antibodies elicited by their envelope glycoproteins can only neutralize strains that are closely related to strains from which the immunogens are derived. Furthermore, the immune response against the determinants of certain viral agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus or dengue virus, can actually exacerbate disease [12,13]. Protecting against new targets faces practical challenges as well.",

            "text": "In its original concept, vaccination aims to mimic the development of naturally acquired immunity by inoculation of nonpathogenic but still immunogenic components of the pathogen in question, or closely related organisms. Vaccination is one of the most effective tools allowing near or complete eradication of fatal diseases. In recent times, vaccination was based on conventional approaches that were successful in several diseases but they require the pathogen to be grown in laboratory conditions, are time-consuming and allow for the identification of only the most abundant antigens, which can be purified in quantities suitable for vaccine testing. The conventional approach to vaccine development uses two methods: first, attenuation of pathogens by serial passages in vitro to obtain live-attenuated strains to be used as vaccines, and second, identification of protective antigens to be used in non-living, subunit vaccines. Using conventional vaccinology, vaccines targeting pathogens with low antigenic variability and those for which protection depends on antibody mediated immunity like polio, MMR, Tetanus, Influenza, and Diptheria, had been licensed. Furthermore, if we are dealing with non-cultivatable microorganisms or have high antigenic variability or need T cell-dependent induced immunity like MenB, TB, HIV, Hepatitis B & C, Malaria and parasite diseases, there is no advance to development a specific vaccine. With the development of the DNA sequencing technologies in the 1970s till recent years, we observed the completion of the sequencing of the genome of humans, a number of invertebrate species including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans and expanding number of microbial pathogens of medical and economic importance (Dalton et al., 2003). Expansion of these sequence information developed new approaches to decode, analyze and share these massive genetic data. The most widely used term for these approaches is the genomics. Genomics, studying the genome of organisms as a whole, and postgenomics technologies including investigating RNA (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), identification of immunogenic proteins (immunomics) and metabolites (metabolomics), have had a considerable impact in all areas of biological research (Bambini and Rappuoli, 2009), and the field of vaccinology is no exception.",

            "text": "This MenB vaccine is also the first vaccine approved for human use for which the starting point of development relied on genomic data and bioinformatics to select the initial pool of antigen candidates by reverse vaccinology (RV) [11]. \n\nThe great developments in the speed of DNA sequencing and the associated computational methods have enabled large-scale antigen mining by RV and it has already been used for several pathogens [12][13][14][15][16][17], mainly bacteria, but recently also for herpes simplex virus [18] to find surface expressed or secreted antigen candidates. Initially, candidates are often found to be suboptimal in terms of stability, safety, immunogenicity, or generating broad protection against all strains of the pathogen. Structural vaccinology (SV) is a rational approach that can be used to address these issues. Major aims in SV are the identification of protective Bcell epitopes on the antigens and optimizing the antigens in terms of stability, epitope presentation, ease of production and safety. SV is a symbiosis between experimental methods like X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, and computational methods like structural modeling, computational scaffold design and epitope prediction. Recent breakthrough examples in the fields of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [19], human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [20], MenB [21] and group B streptococcus (GBS) [22] indicate that SV has the potential to become another revolutionary step in vaccine development given that many of the important infectious diseases currently not preventable by vaccines are not amenable to traditional approaches. In this review we discuss the experimental and computational aspects of three key modules of a modern vaccine development pipeline: reverse vaccinology, epitope  characterization, and structure-based antigen optimization and design. Of the myriad of experimental methods, algorithms, and software developed for these approaches, we highlight the ones we consider of highest practical relevance for vaccine development. We summarize our view of the whole vaccine development process for current and near future vaccines in Figure 1.",

            "text": "Biomedical research in the 21st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution. While traditional methods of vaccine development, such as inactivated whole viruses, are still used today (1), vaccine development is no exception. The shift toward omics-based approaches to vaccine development began to take hold with the meningococcal type B vaccine, which was developed using reverse vaccinology in the early 2010s (15,16). Under this approach, the genome of a pathogen is screened to identify potential vaccine targets (16), and pathogens of interest are then expressed in vitro and tested in animal models to determine their immunogenicity (16). In this way, the genomic revolution catalyzed a fundamental shift in the development of vaccines. Such technologies could revolutionize the role of vaccines given their potential to address one of the major limitations of vaccines today and facilitate the design of therapeutic, rather than just prophylactic, vaccines (17).\n\nNucleic acid-based approaches share an underlying principle: a vector that delivers the information needed to produce an antigen. When the host cells manufacture the antigen, it can then trigger an immune response. The fact that no part of the virus is introduced aside from the genetic code of the antigen means that these vaccines carry no risk of infection. Such approaches build on subunit vaccination strategies, in which a component of a virus (e.g., an antigenic protein) is delivered by the vaccine. Platforms based on genomic sequencing began to be explored beginning in the 1980s as genetic research became increasingly feasible. Advances in genetic engineering allowed for gene sequences of specific viral antigens to be grown in vitro (18). Studies also demonstrated that model organisms could be induced to construct antigens that would trigger an immune response (19)(20)(21). These two developments sparked interest in whether it could be possible to identify any or all of the antigens encoded by a virus's genome and train the immune response to recognize them.\n\nThe delivery and presentation of antigens are fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus. Vaccines that deliver nucleic acids allow the introduction of foreign substances to the body to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses (22). Delivering a nucleic acid sequence to host cells allows the host to synthesize an antigen without exposure to a viral threat (22). Host-synthesized",

            "text": "Vaccination is now in its third century of practice. Beginning in 1796, the year in which vaccinology was born thanks to Edward Jenner, different approaches have implemented vaccine features in terms of effectiveness and safety [18]. \n\nUntil 1980, an empirical approach was used and microorganisms or their toxins had to be attenuated or killed and injected into the vaccine in order to elicit an immune response in the recipient. This method enabled the development of vaccines that, while generally highly immunogenic, had several side effects due to their high reactogenicity. Rabies vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccines, the Mumps, Rubella, and Measles vaccines, live attenuated and killed Polio vaccines, and polysaccharide vaccines against Meningococcus A, C, W, Y, and Haemophilus influenzae type B were all obtained by following an empirical approach [18]. \n\nIn the 1980s, important technological advances led to the production of conjugated vaccines and vaccines obtained using recombinant DNA technology. \n\nGlycoconjugate vaccines addressed the problem of low immunogenicity in highly purified vaccines by conjugating polysaccharides to proteins, leading to the production of novel conjugated vaccines against Pneumococcus, Haemophilus Influenzae type B, and Meningococcus A, C, W, and Y which were able to elicit a better immunological response in both children and in the elderly [18]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology provided the ability to produce pathogen components in non-pathogenic vectors without the need for the pathogen itself, improving the safety and purity of vaccines and enabling the development of vaccines against Hepatitis B and Human Papilloma Virus, among others [18]. \n\nIn recent years, the availability of wide genomic screening has given rise to the possibility of analysing entire bacterial and viral genomes to discover novel vaccine targets. This new approach, known as \"reverse vaccinology\", has led to the development of vaccines otherwise impossible to produce, such as the Meningococcus B vaccine. \n\nMoreover, other innovative and interesting approaches include synthetic biology and structural biology.",

Advances in immunology, molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics, and proteomics have added new perspectives to the vaccinology field. The use of recombinant proteins allows the targeting of immune responses focused against few protective antigens. There are a variety of expression systems with different advantages, allowing the production of large quantities of proteins depending on the required characteristics. Live recombinant bacteria or viral vectors effectively stimulate the immune system as in natural infections and have intrinsic adjuvant properties. DNA vaccines, which consist of non-replicating plasmids, can induce strong long-term cellular immune responses. Prime-boost strategies combine different antigen delivery systems to broaden the immune response. In general, all of these strategies have shown advantages and disadvantages, and their use will depend on the knowledge of the mechanisms of infection of the target pathogen and of the immune response required for protection. In this review, we discuss some of the major breakthroughs that have been achieved using recombinant vaccine technologies, as well as new approaches and strategies for vaccine development, including potential shortcomings and risks.",

Analysis of the mouse sera revealed 90 previously unknown surface located proteins, 28 of which were able to induce antibodies that killed the bacteria in the presence of complement. In earlier studies, only 12 surface antigens of meningococcus had been described and only 4 had been shown to possess bactericidal activity. Phase III clinical trials of a Men B vaccine effective against most meningococcal strains are currently underway Other chapters of the book are devoted to bacterial toxins, glycoconjugate chemistry, novel adjuvants, intralymphatic vaccination and the development of vaccines against infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n\nOnly one chapter is entirely devoted to the development of a viral vaccine, namely against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, in various parts of the book, it is suggested that in future, reverse vaccinology together with structural biology may be used to develop vaccines against hepatitis C virus, human rotavirus and human immunodeficiency virus 1. It should be noted that virologists tend to use the term reverse vaccinology in a different way from the one used in this book. Following Dennis Burton (Nat. Rev. Immunol 2, 706;2002) virologists use the term to refer to the strategy of generating a vaccine from the known crystallographic structure of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, rather than by the usual reverse approach of generating protective antibodies by immunization. Attempts to generate an HIV-1 vaccine by this type of reverse vaccinology, using crystal structures of HIV-1 epitopes bound to antibodies have failed so far because it is not possible to extrapolate from antigenic structures observed in an antigen-antibody complex to the immunogenic structure needed in a vaccine.",

Moreover, in many cases the antigens expressed during infection are not produced in laboratory conditions, as well as the proteins that are most abundant and easily purified are not necessarily protective antigens and, in any case, only few molecules can be isolated and tested simultaneously (Serruto and Rappuoli 2006). The last decade has witnessed a revolution i n t h e a p p r o a c h t o v a c c i n e d e s i g n a n d development. These advances include new delivery technologies aimed at improving the safety and immunogenicity of traditional vaccines, new strategies to identify protective antigens, generation of improved adjuvants. Considering that new diseases are sure to emerge through evolution by mutation and gene exchange, interspecies transfer or human exposure to novel environments, more reliable approaches must be available to promptly respond to those threats (Plotkin 2005). Thanks to sophisticated technologies such as genomics, proteomics, functional genomics and synthetic chemistry, the rational identification of antigens, the synthesis of complex glycans, the generation of engineered carrier proteins are possible. This leads to identify, generate and test new vaccines, to use not only against infectious diseases but also in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, allergies, chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. There are several vaccine modalities currently under investigation, including subunit vaccines, syntetic peptide vaccines, ex-vivo loaded dendritic cells (DCs) and genetic vaccination, that will be here discussed.",

            "text": "The ultimate goal of Vaccinology is to learn how to select protective antigens for a given bacterial pathogen by \"simply\" reading its genome sequence. When this \"Holy Grail\" is reached, vaccine research will mostly be performed in silico, animal use will be restricted to toxicity studies only, and vaccine efficacy will be directly demonstrated in humans.\n\nAlthough we are still a few years away from this ambitious goal, rational approaches have been developed that allow to successfully reduce the list of candidates entering the animal screening assays down to few tens. They include bioinformatics analysis to select membrane and surface-associated proteins (2,26), high throughput strategies to identify antigens that are immunogenic during infection (13,27), and proteomic analyses aimed at the identification of proteins protruding out of the bacterial cell (3).\n\nThe present work describes a further, substantial improvement of the strategies so far employed in that it singles out the relevant protective antigens without using functional assays in animals. Starting from the observation that all vaccines induc-ing broadly protective antibody responses are constituted by bacterial components that are sufficiently conserved and are either secreted or abundantly expressed on the surface, we reasoned that if such category of proteins are searched by using a battery of experimental protocols, those proteins that are consistently identified by all the experimental approaches employed would be the protective ones. We have tested this strategy on Group A Streptococcus, a human pathogen for which an effective vaccine is still missing despite decades of intensive research (9). Three different approaches were used for antigen identification. The first was based on bacterial protease digestion coupled to mass spectrometry methodology (3) with which we scanned the surface of several clinical isolates for protruding proteins by \"piling\" off and analyzing their exposed moieties. With the second approach, the bacterial surface of several clinical isolates was probed with antibodies produced against a group of recombinant proteins selected by multiple genome analysis on the basis of their predicted surface location and sequence conservation. The third experimental strategy indirectly established which of the recombinant proteins selected for antibody production was well expressed during infection by determining their immunogenicity in sera from pharyngitis patients. Once the three lists of antigens derived from the application of the three technologies were available, all proteins were tested in",

The reverse vaccinology approach, in which the genome of an organism is examined to identify novel antigens, has brought about a new generation of vaccine candidates [42,43]. Advances in multi-strain genome sequencing have enabled not only the identification of novel surface antigens, but also the ability to discern polymorphic and conserved regions. However, vaccines designed using protein sequence alone are not likely to induce optimal antibody responses to pathogen antigens in their native state. The application of structural vaccinology may be the next step in rational vaccine design. Similar to structure-based drug design [44,45], the structural vaccinology strategy employs structural data from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and/or cryo-EM to inform the rational design of novel vaccine antigens. \n\nCurrently, the use of structure-based vaccine design in malaria or disordered antigens is sparse. One study of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from Plasmodium falciparum detailed the structure of the immunodominant NANP repeat region when complexed with functional antibodies elicited by RTS,S vaccinees [46,47]. In that study the same peptide epitope was found to adopt different conformations when bound to different anti-",

            "text": "Genomic era and high-throughput technologies represent a turning point in vaccine discovery. The ability to sequence whole genomes and produce hundreds of recombinant proteins rapidly and efficiently has enabled almost entire bacterial proteomes to be scanned by in vivo and in vitro assays to identify the few protective antigens that can be included in vaccine formulations. \n\nThe first 'from-genome-to-vaccine' approach was pioneered by Stephen Johnston and colleagues [1], who constructed a plasmid library of the whole Mycoplasma genome and used it with DNA immunization to select the genes that protect mice against Mycoplasma challenge. Although the approach was not further pursued because of the inefficiency of DNA immunization when applied in high-throughput modalities, it represents a hallmark in vaccinology in that it has set the basis for subsequent, more effective strategies. One of these strategies involves the cloning and expression of a large fraction of the bacterial protein repertoire and the screening of each purified recombinant protein in appropriate 'surrogate of protection' assays. This approach was first attempted by Ling Lissolo and coworkers with uncertain results [2] but subsequently proved to be extremely effective by Pizza et al. [3], Maione et al. [4] and Stranger-Jones et al. [5] for an increasing number of pathogens. Vaccines developed following this strategy are currently in advanced clinical studies [6] and close to reaching the market. A second approach involves the shotgun cloning of the whole genome of a given pathogen such that Escherichia coli expression libraries are generated in which clones express protein domains on their surface. The expression libraries are then screened with sera from patients infected by the pathogen of interest and the identified immunogenic proteins are tested for their capacity to elicit protective immunity in animal models [7]. \n\nThe main limitation of the above technologies is that for them to be effective, several hundreds of proteins have to be tested in extremely time-consuming and laborintensive protection assays, which usually involve animal immunization and challenge.",

The method has proved to be very useful in evaluating basic B cell biology concepts in health and autoimmunity. Furthermore, valuable mAbs, have been isolated from vaccinated [46], naturally immunized donors [45] and patients with autoimmune disease [76]. In general, mAbs recovered by single B cell antibody technologies may be useful reagents for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic studies and clinical development. Major applications include the prevention of infectious diseases by passive immunization [77] and therapies for disorders currently medicated with serum IgG preparations [78]. A deeper understanding of neutralizing mAbs isolated from immune donors will also be helpful for rationale structure-based vaccine designs. Promising efforts in this reverse vaccinology approach are currently being made in HIV research, and should be applicable in other infectious diseases. In addition, future advancements on microfluidic platforms, including PCR cycling combined with next generation sequencing methods are likely to exceed the current systems and allow for high-throughput Ig gene sequence analyses of individual antibody repertoires. By increasing the availability of such repertoires, single B cell antibody technologies are likely to lead in the development of novel mAb therapeutics.",

While it primarily deals with individual genes, it also includes the myriad regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression (16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22). Similarly, genomics has also expanded in scope to include the comprehensive characterization of gene expression, regulation, interdependency, pre-and post-transcriptional modifications, gene editing, epistasis, complementarity, pleiotropy, and other complex interactions (23). \n\nGenomics is not the only area that has undergone remarkable transformation recently in terms of the technologies and platforms that can be used to design, create, and study vaccines.",

For pathogens that do not grow in vitro, the availability of the genome sequence has enabled the development of recombinant vaccines, as has been carried out for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is underway for hepatitis C. In regard to bacteria, group B meningococcus posed insurmountable obstacles to conventional vaccinology approaches; these were eventually overcome by mining the information from the sequenced genome [23]. A total of 600 potential vaccine candidates were predicted by computer analysis, 350 of which were expressed and tested for immunogenicity [24]. Some of these candidates are now in clinical trials. This genomebased approach, called reverse vaccinology, is now used routinely in vaccine development, and is a major tool in the quest for vaccines against pneumococcus, group B streptococcus and chlamydia (see also Update).\n\nRecently, genome sequencing of both Plasmodium falciparum [25] and its main vector, Anopheles gambiae [26], has sparked off new hopes for an efficient vaccine against malaria. For the rodent models of this disease, subtractive cDNA techniques were used to identify genes that are only expressed in pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite [27,28]. Plasmodium mutants deficient in one of these genes, uis3, are blocked in their early liver-stage development and all subsequent stages, and therefore do not lead to disease. When uis3-deficient sporozoites are used as genetically attenuated vaccines in mice, they confer long-lasting, stage-specific protection [29 ]. This is a promising example of how molecular approaches are employed for the rational design of new vaccines.\n\nAnother example of encouraging progress towards a malaria vaccine was reported by Alonso et al. [30 ]. They describe Phase IIb trials of a subunit vaccine consisting of a recombinant protein (expressed in yeast) composed of the carboxy-terminal of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein and the HBV surface antigen. This fusion protein, together with unfused HBV surface antigen proteins, forms particles. The final vaccine",

However, the use of these antigens as vaccines goes beyond their discovery. The development of efficient vaccines will require the combination of diverse strategies, www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 45 (12) 2012 such as different delivery systems/adjuvants, to present the antigen in a manner that can elicit an adequate and efficient immune response against these antigens. The use of novel biotechnological tools has provided a new arsenal of strategies and possibilities to the field of vaccinology. \n\nHere we review some of these strategies being currently used and discuss their potential for the generation of new human vaccines, as well as the challenges that remain to be solved for their development and use (5).",

            "text": "Vaccines tailored by integrated approaches are urgently needed to address existing and new challenges in combat against human infectious diseases. A new era of vaccine technology started in the 1970s owing to the advent of recombinant DNA technology. The new technology enabled production of single protein or proteins constituting virus-like particles (VLP) potentially modified to achieve optimized vaccine. It also enabled the use of DNA or RNA encoding antigens as vaccines and the generation of modified vectors as carriers for antigens of different pathogens. Meanwhile, structural biology and systems biology have enabled the identification of key antigens and deciphered some aspects of the immune responses they generate. Rationally designed vaccines composed of antigens, delivery systems, and often adjuvants that elicit predictable immune responses against specific epitopes to protect against a particular pathogen are supposed to contain well-defined active substances and excipients. However, this is not always possible due to incomplete knowledge. There are no universally accepted strategies and tools to rationally design vaccines, and vaccine development is still generally a tedious and costly empiric process (Rueckert and Guzm\u00e1n 2012).\n\nIn contrast to earlier generations of vaccines based on the whole microorganism (alive or inactivated) or toxoid, novel vaccine candidates are based on the minimalistic approaches to be devoid of the unwanted side effects. That, however, leads to suboptimal vaccine candidates in terms of immunogenicity or protection against different strains of the same pathogen (Table 1). The immunogenicity suffers due to the lack of the MAMPs in the vaccine formulation. To overcome this disadvantage of the novel vaccine technologies and achieve desirable and adequate efficacy, adjuvants are indispensable parts of most novel vaccine formulations.\n\nIn the next sections, a brief overview of the most commonly used technologies in the development of the new vaccine candidates will be presented, as well as vaccine candidates currently under the status of active clinical trial phases 1-3, and finally, the new generation vaccines which have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be discussed.",

            "text": "\u221222 There are mainly two approaches to vaccine development\ufffd the traditional and reverse vaccinology approaches. A traditional or conventional approach to vaccine development is strictly driven by Pasteur's rules of vaccine development which involves isolation, inactivation, and injection of the subject pathogen that causes the disease to a host. 23 This approach requires the culture of pathogens in order to achieve its isolation and subsequent vaccine development steps. However, not all pathogens can be cultured. For example, the causative agent of hepatitis B was found to be nonculturable, eventually necessitating inactivation and isolation of viral antigen present in the plasma of chronically infected patients. 24 Vaccine development is in itself a complex, expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming process including both the preclinical and clinical phases. Fortunately, with the recent advent of computational methods and immunoinformatics, a reverse vaccinology approach can be utilized for in-silico screening, validation, and evaluation of potential vaccine candidates, reducing the time required for overall vaccine development. 25,26 This approach eliminates the need to propagate and isolate the pathogens while facilitating identification of a large array of potential vaccine candidates that can be assembled as multivalent or multiepitope peptide-based or subunit vaccines. 27 Subunit vaccines constitute antigenic fragments of the pathogen in the form of a purified protein, recombinant protein, polysaccharide, or peptide that are capable of eliciting an immune response. Subunit vaccines encompass easy production and are relatively more safe than whole virus vaccines. However, they may exhibit low immunogenicity which can be overcome by the use of adjuvants and fusion with immunostimulatory molecules. 28 everal types of vaccines and their advantages and disadvantages have been summarized in Table 2. 29 A reverse vaccinology approach has been used to map antigenic epitopes of rotavirus and in-silico subunit vaccine design in the past few years. This review will briefly discuss a general overview of in-silico vaccine development with the main focus on the advances made in in-silico rotavirus vaccine design by the immunoinformatics approach.",

The complexity of the immune response to vaccines has been monitored and analyzed through an analogous approach called systems vaccinology, a branch of systems immunology concentrated on the intrinsic responses of the host to vaccines (21). Parallels can be drawn to reverse vaccinology (RV), which employs both genomics and structural biology to reveal the fraction of the molecular space of a pathogen appropriate for vaccine development (22). \n\nIt is noteworthy that RV has already yielded successes, most notably in the development of a vaccine for Neisseria meningitidis (23). In contrast to RV for vaccines, which can operate at the antigen level, omics and computational approaches for mAb development must be performed at the epitope level, potentially adding increased stringency and complexity to the identification process. Thus, RV is confronted with a significant challenge in the design of mAbs, and the question arises of whether such obstacles hamper knowledge-based solutions. This situation evokes the \"bounded rationality\" idea (24,25), in which rational approaches are inefficient due to limited understanding of the inherent complexity of the task. \n\nIn the following sections, we assess how the availability of huge and variable data sets can be harnessed, together with systems biology, to enhance RV when oriented to epitope selection for mAb development.",

In general, the aim is the identification of genes potentially encoding pathogenicity factors and secreted or membrane-associated proteins. Specific algorithms suitable for the in silico identification of novel surface-exposed and, thus, antibody accessible proteins mediating a protective response are used.\n\nThe first example of a successful application of the reverse vaccinology approach was provided by Pizza and coworkers in collaboration with The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) [12,13]. They describe the identification of vaccine candidates against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B or MenB, the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults. Conventional approaches to obtain a MenB vaccine had failed for decades, mainly for two reasons. First, the capsular polysaccharide, successfully used to make conjugate vaccines against other serogroups, resembles components of human tissues resulting poorly immunogenic in humans and potentially able to induce an autoimmune response [14]. Second, protein-based vaccines focused on variable antigens that confer protection only against a limited number of strains.\n\nThe reverse vaccinology approach started from the determination of the complete genome sequence of a MenB pathogenic strain, MC58. Several computational tools were used to find in the genome, on the basis of sequence features, the presence of amino acid motifs responsible for targeting the mature protein to the outer membrane (signal peptides), to the lipid bilayer (lipoproteins), to the integral membrane (transmembrane domains) or for recognition and interaction with host structures. This analysis allowed researchers to identify 600 putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins. Three hundred and fifty proteins were expressed in a heterologous system, Escherichia coli, purified and used to immunize mice. Mice immune sera were tested for specificity by Western blot, accessibility on the surface of bacterium by flow cytometry and for the capacity to induce bactericidal antibodies by serum bactericidal assay.

Integration of multi-omics technologies with ML algorithms is a promising strategy than can provide useful solutions in research and personalized medicine [80]. For example, ML algorithms can process large datasets derived from genomic and proteomic studies to identify microbial components that trigger immune responses, as seen in the use of reverse vaccinology techniques. Reverse vaccinology, bolstered by ML, has demonstrated the potential to fast-track vaccine design by screening pathogen genomes without the need for traditional culture methods, reducing both time and cost in vaccine research [112]. Specifically, ML-driven tools like VaxiJen and Vaxign-ML have been instrumental in predicting protein antigens that can elicit strong immune responses by analyzing physicochemical properties and genomic sequences of pathogens [113]. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ML approaches were essential in rapidly developing mRNA vaccines by analyzing viral mutations and optimizing vaccine efficacy. These advancements showcase how ML not only expedites the discovery of vaccines but also enhances their accuracy and effectiveness, particularly against MDROs [112,113].",

This smaller set was treated with a further 747 distinct sera from 10 groups of patients, identifying 49 putative candidate antigens. \n\nThis survey, brief though it is, helps to highlight the potential power of reverse vaccinology for vaccine discovery. However, since the number of antigens is high, given all the potential difficulties in characterising and expressing them, it is important to note that both computational and experimental techniques and methodologies will doubtlessly omit important and interesting proteins from further analysis, though not necessarily for the same or similar reasons. Thus, with the burgeoning discipline of reverse vaccinology, both computational and experimental techniques are in need of constant development and improvement.",

            "text": "Bioinformatic analyses of microbial sequences have changed the way searches for vaccine antigens can be conducted; researchers can avoid pathogen isolation, culturing, and fractionation as a means of target identification. However these \"reverse vaccinology\" approaches [1], in which sequences are evaluated relative to their likelihood of encoding protective antigens, carry some limitations such as i) our poor understanding of the characteristics of a pathogen component that make it protective and ii) the inability to query the substantial proportion of any microbial genome that carries no previously described homologs or motifs [2]. Therefore, empirical approaches to rapidly determine the natural functions or non-natural applications of genome-encoded products are needed [3]. Toward this purpose, there has been some progress in using genome databases to recombinantly produce proteins in cell culture or test tubes for printing nanoscale quantities onto glass microscope slides [4]. These protein arrays can be used to perform rapid, parallel in vitro screens if a slidecompatible functional assay is available. Genome-wide screening in mammalian cells using RNA interference and expression libraries has also gained much popularity [5]. However, these platforms do not provide the opportunity to assay activities at the organism level, such as an animal's immune activity.\n\nWe previously described an approach to vaccine antigen discovery that, similar to reverse vaccinology, does not require pathogen culturing but in contrast does not rely on bioinformatic analyses nor require recombinant protein production. Instead, it is based on the delivery of each gene in vivo and its direct functional testing as a vaccine candidate in host animals. Using expression library immunization (ELI) [6], pathogen genomes can be searched for protective antigens in streamlined multiplexed animal challenge assays [7][8][9]. Here, this parallel-testing strategy is extended for use in searching for any measurable biological activity encoded by a gene in vivo. It uses genomic sequence information to prepare genes for rapid and unbiased isolation of biological effectors. As demonstration, we chose a pathogen with a novel immune activity of potential application for therapeutic immune-modulation.\n\nThe Poxviridae Family includes many well-known pathogens. They carry complex genomes that encode a variety of mechanisms for subverting the immune responses of infected hosts [10",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology, developed by Rappouli et al. is a technology first used in Meningococcus serogroup B bacteria to identify novel vaccine antigens (Figure 1). Here, the pathogen's genome is sequenced and analyzed to have access to the entire repertoire of proteins and enable comparison of conserved sequences shared among pathogens of the same species (65). Genomic data is analyzed using bioinformatics tools, taking into consideration all open reading frames. Also, with the use of computational tools, genomic sequences that are homologous to those of humans are eliminated from the vaccine candidates identified. The remaining genes are isolated and inserted into a suitable vector to obtain proteins for testing in animal models. Responses to the vaccine antigens are analyzed in immunized mice to validate their immunogenicity and efficacy levels. Importantly, molecular epidemiology studies are undertaken using various strains of the pathogen to ascertain whether the selected antigens are conserved or highly variable in a given population (66). This approach has been used to develop vaccines against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (67); and identify vaccine candidates for, S. agalactia and S. pyogenes (68,69). This vaccine design approach has greatly enhanced the discovery and characterization of several pathogen antigens. Reverse vaccinology has been applied in malaria to identify parasite proteins either secreted or involved in signaling for consideration as possible vaccine candidates. The genomic sequence of P. falciparum has been available since 2002 (70). In addition, the sequence of other diverse Plasmodium spp including primate (71,72) and rodent (73) parasites have been published. Comparative analysis of these sequences has shown similar homologs between species with possibly similar functions. For instance, the conserved Pf48/45 and PfHAP2 genes, both of which are transmission blocking vaccine candidates, functions were determined based on the role of their homologs in other Plasmodium spp. The functional analysis of the P48/45 and PHAP2 genes in P. berghei established their significant role in reducing the fertility of male gametes during fertilization, promoting these genes as vaccine candidates (74,75), which are currently in the preclinical stage",

Antimicrobial resistant vaccines are one of the major vaccines that can be developed technically. The comprehensive and the most promising technologies to combat Antimicrobial resistance are described below: \n\n(a) Reverse vaccinology: This refers to the process of sequencing pathogens genome using computer programs to reveal genomeencoded antigens which will be very hard for ordinary technology to expose. 25 This kind of technology is called reverse vaccinology due to the fact that in the history of vaccine development, it was the first time after a long period of time (i.e. two centuries) that scientists explore new vaccines beginning from the information gotten on a computer in place of microorganism growing. The recent development of newly licensed four-component meningococcus B vaccine (4CMenB) revealed that this technology is efficient in selecting antigens of bacteria which can give broad protection versus bacterial pathogens of different antigens. Essentially, the selection of antigens process begins with genomic information analysis on circulating strains. Antigens of interest are picked on the basis of sequence conservation and forecasted surface exposure which are also distinctly stated as recombinant proteins and are experimented in preclinical models for their strength to trigger functional antibodies. Lastly, more promising antigen of interest are joined together to obtain the best possible result based on the data gotten from molecular epidemiology. Three recombinant antigens i.e. fHbo, NadA and NHBA are used in the case of 4CMenB by the induction of serum antibodies that are able to kill bacteria versus strains which expresses a conserved form of each corresponding protein joined with the OMV from New Zealand meningococcus B Strain, the antibodies induced has the ability to kill the strains showing a conserved form of the outer membrane protein PorA. Parikh and co-workers 26 reported that 4CMenB has been introduced recently to all the infants in UK, it demonstrates effectiveness of 83.9% against all strains of MenB. This achievement of 4CMenB shows that the section of antigen process can be applied to all bacteria pathogens that shows antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "Given the limitations of traditional vaccines and the intricate immune response required to combat F. tularensis effectively, the development of a subunit vaccine that elicits strong coordinated T-cell and B-cell responses is essential. This strategy focuses on harnessing key immunodominant epitopes to activate both arms of the immune system to counteract the immune evasion mechanisms of bacteria and deliver comprehensive protection (8). Although conventional multiantigen vaccines have limitations, peptide-based multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) represent significant advancements. By leveraging in silico methods, MEVs can efficiently identify and target immunodominant epitopes, thereby addressing many shortcomings inherent in traditional vaccine approaches (9,10). Traditional vaccine development is typically time-consuming and costly and requires extensive in vivo and in vitro testing (11). However, advances in computational biology and bioinformatics have revolutionized this process, enabling the rapid design of highly effective vaccine constructs and significantly reducing dependence on labor-intensive traditional laboratory methods (12). Reverse vaccinology is a transformative computational approach that leverages genomic data to design vaccine candidates, without the need for pathogen cultivation. By analyzing protein sequences, this method identifies multiple epitopes that trigger both cellular and humoral immune responses, while minimizing side effects (13, 14). Unlike traditional methods, it uncovers both known and novel antigens, opens new pathways for immune interventions, and enhances our understanding of pathogen-host interactions (15). Epitope-based immune-derived vaccines (IDVs) offer significant safety and efficacy advantages over conventional vaccines, particularly against complex pathogens, such as F. tularensis, which employs advanced immune evasion strategies. IDVs enhance T-cell responses, which are crucial for long-lasting immunity (16). Reverse vaccinology has successfully prioritized and designed vaccine targets for various pathogens (17)(18)(19)(20)(21). MEVs have emerged as effective solutions that incorporate key epitopes to stimulate stronger immune responses, thereby offering superior protection against infectious diseases (22). \n\nIn light of these considerations, our study proposes a comprehensive, two-pronged approach to combat tularemia.",

Studies on reverse vaccination are one of the novel sciences that may be used to find potential antigenic options (Beiranvand et al. 2021). A genetic investigation to identify a potential vaccination against B. abortus isolates is included in this publication. The B. abortus genome is being used uniquely to discover vaccine candidates. An effort to find potential vaccine candidates for meningococcus serogroup B (Neisseria meningitides), reported in 2000, was the first traditional instance of practical reverse vaccinology (Kelly and Rappuoli 2005). After some time, a meningococcus serogroup B vaccine was discovered in 2006 (Giuliani et al. 2006), and encouraging findings were shown after human clinical tests in 2011 (Toneatto et al. 2011). Pathogen antigen discovery continued until Chiang et al. (2015) used reverse vaccinology to effectively identify three antigens as vaccine candidates (Chiang et al. 2015). Reverse vaccinology allows us to filter the proteome using practical criteria, such as protein localization, non-similarity to the human proteome, and MHC binding affinity, reducing the trial-and-error required to uncover potential vaccine candidates (Piri-Gharaghie et al. 2022a). Reverse vaccinology algorithms may quickly identify a particular antigen or a collection of antigens for vaccine design programs using the genetic and cellular protein data on infections. In addition, it is a cost-effective strategy because most screening algorithms and genetic data are readily available. Reverse vaccination is also effective against various diseases, including parasites, viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Using the BLAST program, this strategy may be used for any microorganism (Piri-Gharaghie et al. 202",

The three-dimensional (3D) structures provide crucial insights into the tertiary structure and position of the viral epitopes. Ultimately, the detailed structural information can be exploited to solve some of the challenging problems impeding vaccine development against viruses. Structural vaccinology is a rational approach to generate an effective vaccine that involves (1) determining the atomic structure of the antigen or antigen-antibody complex, (2) remodeling the antigen or the epitope by reverse molecular engineering, (3) incorporating the re-engineered antigen or epitope into one of the vaccine platforms, and (4) testing the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine in vivo (Figure 1).\n\nIn the first step of this approach, the 3D structure of the antigen or antigen-antibody complex will be determined using either one or more of the structural biology tools such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Thereafter, the antigen will be remodeled based on the structural information of the antigen. In addition, the immunological and bioinformatics knowledge should be synergistically combined with the structural insights to design an effective antigen. In most cases, the re-engineering process involves mutations of certain amino acids to stabilize immunogenic conformations, mask unwanted non-neutralizing antibody epitopes, optimize antigen thermostability, or introduce additional epitopes on the antigen. Next, the re-engineered antigen could be incorporated into one of the vaccine platforms such as the recombinant protein vaccine, the viruslike particle vaccine, or the live-attenuated vaccine. Finally, the immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccine should be tested in animal models including mice, ferrets, and macaques. Based on the preclinical findings, the candidate vaccine could be redesigned to improve its immunogenicity and efficacy. Structural vaccinology was shown to be successful in overcoming the challenges facing the bacterial vaccine field.

            "text": "Shigellosis is a significant type of diarrhea that causes 160,000 deaths annually in a global scale. The mortality occurs mainly in children less than 5 years of age. No licensed vaccine is available, and conventional efforts for developing an effective and safe vaccine against shigellosis have not been succeeded yet. The reverse vaccinology is a novel promising method that screens genome or proteome of an organism for finding new vaccine candidates. In this study, through reverse vaccinology approach, new vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri were identified and experimentally evaluated. Proteomes of S. flexneri were obtained from UniProt, and then outer membrane and extracellular proteins were predicted and selected for the evaluation of transmembrane domains, protein conservation, host homology, antigenicity, and solubility. From 103 proteins, 7 high-scored proteins were introduced as novel vaccine candidates, and after B- and T-cell epitope prediction, the best protein was selected for experimental studies. Recombinant protein was expressed, purified, and injected to BALB/c mice. The adhesion inhibitory effect of sera was also studied. The immunized mice demonstrated full protection against the lethal dose challenge. The sera remarkably inhibited S. flexneri adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells. The results indicate that identified antigen can serve for vaccine development against shigellosis and support reverse vaccinology for discovering novel effective antigens. \u2022 Seven Shigella new antigens were identified by reverse vaccinology (RV) approach. \u2022 The best antigen experimented demonstrated full protection against lethal dose. \u2022 In vivo results verified RV analyses and suggest FimG as a new potent vaccine candidate.",

            "text": "Edward Jenner , Louis Pasteur, and Maurice Hilleman developed vaccines by isolating, inactivating, and injecting infectious agents. The vaccines developed by these technologies saved millions of people and many of those vaccines are still in use today. Infl uenza, oral and inactivated polio, measles , mumps , and rubella are good examples of the vaccines that we still use and were developed with this empirical approach. Since the 1980s new technologies started to emerge that made possible vaccines that were impossible with the empirical approach. The fi rst technology was recombinant DNA that made vaccinologists possible to express the hepatitis B virus-like particle (VLP) in yeast and produce large amounts of vaccines. More recently recombinant DNA technologies were used to generate yeast or baculovirus strains expressing VLPs containing the L1 protein of papillomavirus. The next technology that changed the vaccine landscape was the conjugation technology. In this technology, capsular polysaccharides purifi ed from Haemophilus infl uenzae, 13 serogroups of pneumococcus or meningococcus A, C, Y, and W, covalently linked to carrier proteins have been licensed during the last 25 years and have completely eliminated the diseases caused by these bacteria. Finally, the advent of genomics allowed the use of the entire genome of pathogens and to search for protective antigens that were diffi cult or impossible to identify with conventional technologies. The prototype vaccine developed by genome-based approach, also known as reverse vaccinology , is the vaccine against Meningococcus B that was licensed in Europe in 2013 and the USA in January 2015 [ 40 ].\n\nMany new technologies are emerging that are likely to dramatically change the world of vaccines. These include new powerful adjuvants, the ability to design immunogens using their crystal structure (structural vaccinology), and the ability to make synthetic vaccines (using different classes of RNA, peptides, carbohydrates, etc.) [ 41 ].",

            "text": "The second generation of vaccines was also the first to benefit from advances in genome sequencing and genetic engineering technology, which culminated with the advent of reverse vaccinology as we know it (105). Reverse vaccinology enables a genome-scale in silico screening of antigens according to their subcellular location, conservation, and hydrophobicity to predict those that are most likely to be vaccine candidates, which greatly simplifies the process of antigen selection (106). More recently, a third generation of nucleic acid vaccines has been developed. These vaccines overcome the need to isolate or synthetize the antigens needed for immunization, relying instead on having them expressed directly by the host cells (107). Fourth-generation vaccines, also referred to as next-generation vaccines, have an additional advantage as they can be developed as long as the sequence information of the pathogen is known (108). Examples include APC-targeting vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines delivered by nanoparticles, and artificial APC vaccines. APC-targeting vaccines can elicit particular types of responses needed for clearing specific pathogens by targeting different receptors of the APCs (109). Nucleic acid vaccines delivered by nanoparticles, mostly lipid nanoparticles, can stabilize nucleic acids, particularly mRNA, to enable the entry into cells and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses (108). Artificial APCs mimic APCs attached with epitope-loaded MHC molecules and costimulatory molecules, bypassing antigen processing and directly activating T cells to generate large numbers of immune effectors and achieve faster clearance of pathogens (110). \n\nDue to their nonreplicative nature, antigenic properties, and adjuvanticity, OMVs as immunogens do not really fit in any of the previously mentioned vaccine categories. As such, OMV-based vaccines constitute a category of their own. \n\nThe pluripotency of OMVs as adjuvants, antigens, and delivery platforms is being extensively investigated and has been proven by the development of several OMVbased pharmaceutical prototypes in the last 2 decades, which have been well summarized in other reviews (44,111,112).",

            "text": "The development of several vaccines has been hampered by technical difficulties. Vaccines can be developed following the principles of Pasteur, i.e., isolating, inactivating and injecting causative microorganisms. Such development, however, is not apt for all pathogens, especially for those which cannot be grown in cultures, including HCV, papillomaviruses 16 and 18 and Mycobacterium leprae or for antigenically hypervariable microorganisms such as N. meningitidis type B, N. gonorrhoea, malaria and HIV [9]. In recent years, many obstacles in the engineering of vaccines have been overcome. Using \"reverse vaccinology\" [20], a process in which computer analysis, microarrays, proteomics and other genome-based systematic approaches are used to select genomic sequences of microorganisms, antigens likely to confer protective immunity can be identified. Candidate antigens can be expressed by recombinant DNA and be tested in animal models. Reverse vaccinology has enabled the production of vaccines against HCV, human papillomaviruses, and meningococci type B. These examples will be followed for other pathogens representing a threat to infants and children. \n\nThe pediatric infectious disease specialist will have to define priorities, and will have to conceive plans to test the safety and efficacy of these future vaccines, as well as the surveillance of the epidemiology of the targeted pathogens following the introduction of the vaccines on a larger scale. \n\nA change in paradigm in vaccinology has come from the recognition that conquering the most difficult infections such as HIV and malaria may require the T cell arm of the immune system. Most vaccines available today work by inducing antibodies, and quantification of these antibodies is often used as a parameter for immunogenicity of and protection by a given vaccine. Unfortunately, protective antibody levels are not clearly defined for every available vaccine. Moreover, as in the example of HBV vaccine, the levels of specific antibodies may not be indicative for the status of protection. The level of specific antibodies may be below the limit of detection but vaccinated individuals may be still protected against HBV infection by the cellular immune responses.",

The methods of reverse vaccinology have also been used to understand and improve upon modestly successful vaccine strategies-such as that observed in the seminal RV144 trial and its immune correlates analysis, which revealed antibody responses to the gp120 V1/V2 region correlated inversely with infection risk [19]. While the vaccine candidates used for the prime-boost regimen were not developed by structure-based design, this method is being used by some laboratories for the rational development of subsequent candidates [20][21][22] as a way to engineer immunogens capable of inducing even more broadly neutralizing antibody repertoires.\n\nAlthough the methods described above have advanced the science of HIV vaccinology, the greatest leap forward in the use of structural biology for the design of viral surface protein immunogens occurred in the resolution and stabilization of the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of pneumonia in children and the elderly [23][24][25][26][27]. The work with RSV, though owing some of its success to technologies developed through investigations into HIV immunology, has created gains that have reciprocally informed efforts in HIV vaccine research as well as coronavirus vaccine development. Most notably, the evolution of the science culminated in early 2020, with the structural resolution of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion Spike glycoprotein and its rapid translation into the key immunogen used in the most effective COVID-19 vaccines [28]. The advances made in structural biology and reverse vaccinology for HIV, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 are now expanding to vaccine designs for other pathogens, like influenza and meningococcus, and are precipitating a paradigm shift in the entire field of vaccine development.",

            "text": "When crystallographers study the structure of an Env epitope recognized by a neutralizing Mab, they often claim that their data will help the rational design of vaccine immunogens able to elicit antibodies endowed with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab used to define the epitope [25][26][27]. \n\nIn vaccine development, the term design usually means selecting a vaccine candidate and finding appropriate vaccine formulations, schedules, adjuvants and routes of administration. The strategy of rational, structure-based design discussed here is more circumscribed since it refers to the development and optimization of a vaccine immunogen within the restricted context of a single Mab-antigen pair. This approach assumes that if a viral antigen can be modified so that it binds better to a neutralizing Mab, it will have acquired the immunogenic capacity of eliciting neutralizing polyclonal antibodies [28]. \n\nIt will be argued here that the claims of reverse vaccinology are based (1) on misconceptions regarding the nature of protein epitopes and of immunological specificity, (2) on the assumption that a discontinuous epitope defined by X-ray crystallography can act as an effective vaccine immunogen on its own without being embedded in a multi-epitopic protein that always induces many different types of antibodies, (3) on the belief that effective vaccine immunogens can be predicted from the antigenic structure of viral antigens bound to neutralizing Mabs. \n\nResearch carried out over the last two decades has demonstrated that reverse vaccinology has not been able to guide the design of an HIV vaccine nor of any other viral vaccine [29]. The present review expands on an earlier analysis of the limitations of reverse vaccinology [29] and shows that antibody polyspecificity explains why elucidating the structure of viral epitopes recognized by a neutralizing Mab is of little use for discovering immunogens capable of inducing a protective immune response.",

The whole genome sequence is needed for epitopes and other proteins prediction which is a significant requirement for candidate vaccine development. Also, combining phage therapeutics with antibiotics shows a promising approach for drug development in combating antimicrobial resistance. Artificial Intelligence with machine learning algorithm had shown great potential in targeting wide array of bacteria which will improve the development of antimicrobials with no strains of resistance. Also, the use of nanoparticles as antimicrobials to target the delivery site will be of great significance to combat resistance.

            "text": "Vaccines have been one of the most pivotal achievements in the history of public health. The elimination of smallpox in 1980 and the near-eradication of polio have been two of the most significant achievements of immunization in the last two centuries [1,2]. Globally, vaccination saves over 386 million life years and 96 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) each year, preventing approximately six million deaths [3]. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, pneumococcal pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), and smallpox are among the illnesses for which vaccines are currently available [4]. However, there is a need for more efficient vaccines for these diseases. Furthermore, despite the achievements in vaccinations, many infectious diseases worldwide, such as dengue fever, hepatitis C, and herpes, are still lacking vaccines [4]. \n\nMost of the currently available vaccines were developed using a traditional vaccinology approach. Conventional vaccinology employs two methods: (i) whole pathogen vaccines (live-attenuated and inactivated), in which the relevant protective antigens are unknown; and (ii) subunit vaccines, which primarily focus on protective antigens recognized during infection [5]. However, this vaccine development strategy is (i) time-consuming, taking 5-15 years; (ii) high-risk because the pathogen must be grown in a laboratory to identify the components suitable for vaccine development; and (iii) limited to antigens expressed in vitro [6]. Reverse vaccinology (RV) can overcome these constraints, allowing for the development of more effective and innovative vaccines [6]. \n\nRV is a promising vaccine development technique focused on identifying a subset of promising antigens from pathogen proteomes through computational analysis as the first step in developing protein subunit vaccines [6]. After this first step in identifying antigens in RV, similar to conventional vaccinology, the antigens require validation in vitro and in vivo using experimental assays to confirm their protective potential. RV was first used in 2000 to identify novel antigens for developing a vaccine, Bexsero \u00ae , against meningococcus B [6,7].",

In this study, we have integrated pangenomics, reverse vaccinology, and immunoinformatics approaches for the design and evaluation of a multi-epitope vaccine against K. pneumoniae. A pangenome approach has been applied for the identification of core proteins that can be used for developing broad spectrum therapeutics against bacterial infections [10]. It is important that the prioritized therapeutic targets are vital for the survival of pathogen and they are not human-homologs [11]. Furthermore, extracellular and secretory proteins are likely to be vaccine candidates [12]. \n\nIdeally, a vaccine should contain conserved epitopes that in turn can generate specific B-cell and T-cell (CD4 and CD8) responses [13][14][15]. This will enable the induction of pathogen-specific immune responses with minimal side effects by incorporating highly conserved epitopes in a vaccine formulation [16]. Using immunoinformatics approaches, the structure of the multi-epitope vaccine was modeled, and molecular refinements were applied. Finally, the vaccine was docked with TLR2 and TLR4 to decipher various interactions between the designed vaccine and immune receptors.",

            "text": "Structure-based reverse vaccinology [52,63] represents an important constituent of rational vaccine design, where an attempt is made to produce a vaccine using information from the observed crystallographic structure of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) bound to their complementary epitopes. Such structural vaccinology is believed to represent a way to facilitate rational design of better antigens able to act as vaccine immunogens. Computer-based reverse engineering methodology utilizes the available structures of pathogenic proteins and antigen-antibody complexes and uses docking and modeling studies to predict epitopes to reconstruct an epitope capable of mAb binding, where the structure of mAb is used as a template in a process similar to rational drug design, where the 3D structure of a biological target is used for designing molecules capable of the selective binding to and specific inhibition of the biological activity of a target molecule [12]. It should be noted that mAbs used in this context must have been shown to be broadly neutralizing (in vitro). Here, an assumption is made that such an antigen \"rationally\" designed to fit the mAb would have the desired immunogenic potential and would be able to induce polyclonal antibodies (Abs) that would possess neutralizing properties similar to those of the mAb used as the template for the computational reconstruction of the antigen. Alternatively, one can utilize available information on the whole genomes/proteomes of various pathogens and use computational approaches to identify the bacterial/viral surface antigens that are most likely to be vaccine candidates. The rationale of this approach is based on the assumption that virtually all of the proteins of the pathogenic microorganisms are likely to contain antigenic sites that can be predicted by computational means. Here, the entire bacterial or viral proteome is subjected to in silico analysis in order to find all of the antigens that a bacterial or viral pathogen is able to express [52,63]. Again, structural vaccinology is utilized here for prediction and characterization of structural epitopes of immunogenic antigens. At the next stage of both approaches, the ability of individual antigens to elicit immunity in animal models is tested [13,65].",

            "text": "The biophysical, biochemical, and genetic engineering technologies needed for structural vaccinology are sophisticated, but the concept is simple: first, study the native molecular architecture of neutralization determinants; and then, use this knowledge to modify the molecules and engineer immunogens that are optimally designed for inclusion in protective vaccines. Success of structural vaccinology will require the application of high throughput methods to generate a large number of antigenic structures and assays to predict their effectiveness as immunogens. With current knowledge, we can already optimize protein antigens for efficient production, conformational homogeneity, and stable storage. However, fully realizing the potential of structure based design of vaccine antigens will require longer-term basic research into the structural determinants of immunodominance and immunogenicity. This research must take into account the diversity of the antibody repertoire generated not only in a single individual, but also in those of different genetic backgrounds and histories of antigen exposure. New techniques, such sorting IgG + antibody secreting plasma cells to rapidly clone human monoclonal antibodies specific for a recent immunogen [69], make such analyses feasible. \n\nThe application of structural insight to vaccine design is especially important for new vaccines against viral pathogens. The greater number of protective determinants of bacteria, fungi, and parasites make them suitable for a reverse vaccinology approach to discovering protective determinants with favorable vaccine antigen characteristics [6]. The limited number of protective determinants on most viruses necessitates optimizing a relatively small set of macromolecules. Antigen optimization is not limited to subunit vaccines. Live attenuated, vectored, and viruslike-particle vaccines could also incorporate antigens that have been optimized based on structural insights. Matching the rational design of antigens to advances in the rational design of adjuvants can enable a new generation of vaccines that are more safe, broadly protective, practical, and affordable than those available today.",

            "text": ";Van Regenmortel, 2016). These pitfalls underscore the importance of acquiring new structural and functional insights into humoral immune responses against pathogens. Furthermore, incorporation of multiple structural techniques especially nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is favorable to study the structure and molecular dynamics of antigen-antibody complexes (Moraes et al., 2016). As structural vaccinology is still developing, its application is primarily limited to the design of recombinant protein vaccine, peptide vaccine, and VLPs. These vaccine platforms are associated with low immunogenicity. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate structural vaccinology with other complementary key technologies. For instance, DS-Cav1 protein vaccine could be integrated with the single-round replication recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector to potentially enhance its immunogenicity if required (Johnson et al., 2013). Lastly, a structural vaccinology approach should be extended to improve T-cell responses and not just focus on the B-cell responses to produce better viral vaccines in the future.",

            "text": "Our laboratory has advocated for a new approach to vaccine discovery characterized as a ''discover -validate -characterize -deploy'' paradigm based on the foundations of vaccinomics and personalized vaccinology [2][3][4]. This approach moves away from a focus on the smaller details of immune function and advocates pursuing an understanding of the immune system as a whole in order to improve and expand upon empirical vaccine science. Furthermore, the approach is personalized in that it emphasizes a tiered risk and vaccination approach for new vaccines, multiple avenues of vaccine administration that take advantage of new findings (e.g., in mucosal immunology allowing for oral, transcutaneous, depot, and mucosal delivery), multiple highly specific vaccine adjuvants, directed vaccine development using systems biology and computational ap- proaches, and private, public, and academic partnerships in the development of new vaccine candidates. An initial aspect of this new approach is the concept of reverse vaccinology, which uses sophisticated computer analysis of genomic data to characterize pathogen antigens and eliminate those with human homology. This is followed by careful screening of the remaining antigens for immunogenicity and eventual use in new vaccine products [5,6]. For example, reverse immunology was used to create a recombinant protein containing nine different Th epitopes that has been used to enhance the hemophilus influenza type b oligosaccharide vaccine [7]. A large number of reverse immunology studies have focused on the characterization of T cell responses to vaccinia virus and have identified hundreds of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes. Other studies have carefully examined the vaccinia transciptome. [8]. Vaccinomics seeks to better and more fully integrate these findings, correlating humoral and cellular immune measures with transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic data to gain a greater understanding of viral immunity. One such integrated study has uncovered complex interactions between CD4, CD8, and humoral responses to vaccinia virus [9]. \n\nFigure 1 outlines some of the important features that might be employed by a vaccinomics approach.",

            "text": "The field of reverse vaccinology developed is an outcome of the genome sequence revolution. Vaccine candidates for control of theileriosis, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, anaplasmosis and the cattle tick have been identified using reverse vaccinology approaches (Lew-tabor and Valle 2016). Reverse vaccinology (RV) involves use of bioinformatics analysis of genome sequence data along with the laboratory screening to identify new vaccine candidate (Rappuoli 2000). It involves new approach of not involving a pathogen to be cultivated for discovery of vaccine. For vaccine design, computers are used and no live organism is involved. It provides all the protein antigens that a pathogen can express at any time by genome sequence analysis. This approach was used in small genomes pathogens and resulted in the first successful vaccine produced against meningititis and sepsis causing bacteria (type B Neisseria meningitidis) in children and young (Adu-Bobie et al. 2003;Rappuoli 2000). Reverse vaccinology approaches for eukaryotes have also recently been used but that describes the detail study of vaccine candidate identification and not the approach applied (Schubert-Unkmeir and Christodoulides 2013). For many parasites species including Schistosoma (Wang et al. 2016), Cryptosporidium (Manque et al. 2011), Toxoplasma (Sette and Rappuoli 2010), Giardia and Trichomonas (Aslett et al. 2009) many databases 'omic' and EST have evolved with the arrival of more genome sequences. In an in silico study of Neospora caninum using RV approach, several potential vaccine candidates are shortlisted and ranked (Goodswen et al. 2017). For the parasites, RV approach had not yet produced any commercialised products. Protozoan genome based RV approach for the genus Leishmania was developed (Rezende et al. 2012). For parasite (protozoa) and veterinary vaccines such as coccidiosis, the databases and in silico tools for vaccine design have kept evolving for example, VIOLIN-Vaccine Investigation and Online Information Network.

When considering pathogens that require a T cell response, such as malaria, tuberculosis and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), epitopes prediction software can be combined with reverse vaccinology tools, but will require expensive wet lab validation and are time-consuming [13,15,17]. In addition, there are many layers of antigenic complexity that need to be addressed such as accessibility of surface antigens, antigen masking, protein degradation, posttranslational modifications, exon-intron structures, alternative splicing, especially for eukaryotic antigens [8]. In the case of viral antigens, reverse vaccinology still needs to address how to predict accurately protein complexes and expression levels [8]. \n\nIn this work, novel, potential K. pneumoniae antigens with a high predominance in carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates were identified and characterized in silico, using a reverse vaccinology approach. Using several available bioinformatics tools (Table S1) [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17], a multiepitope vaccine containing T and B cell epitopes of the antigens was designed and characterized for its antigenic potential. We also assessed the molecular docking between our multiepitope vaccine and TLR-2 and TLR-4, due to their importance in K. pneumoniae infection [2,10,14,18,19]. A cloning strategy to produce the suggested multiepitope approach is suggested, and an immunization simulation was also performed and analyzed.",

            "text": "This process involves antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or the production of antibodies/immunoglobulins, ultimately conferring immunity against particular diseases [6,7]. \n\nReverse vaccinology (RV) is an approach that relies on computational tools to analyze a region of genome, usually encoding a protein, that can generate an immune response to a pathogen in order to identify potential vaccine candidates [9]. These computational tools serve to anticipate antigens that are likely to induce protective responses, as well as the precise regions of antigens, epitopes, recognized by the immune system [10]. Thus, RV allows researchers to identify potential vaccine targets more quickly and efficiently; furthermore, it can be particularly useful for pathogens that are difficult to grow in the laboratory. \n\nIn this review, we offer a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on the use of reverse vaccinology in the design of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we emphasize the critical role of computational tools and algorithmic complexities that played an instrumental role in the accelerated development of vaccines for COVID-19. We delve deeply into the steps of reverse vaccinology and compare the in silico tools employed in pertinent studies. Additionally, we summarize and reference significant works that have provided valuable insights into the applications of bioinformatics in addressing the biological challenges posed by COVID-19.",

            "text": "Just over a decade ago, Rino Rappuoli used the expression \"reverse vaccinology\" to describe development of vaccines using a genomic-based approach, rather than the ponderous empirical methods favoured then, and still in use today. Reverse vaccinology seems about to deliver on its early potential: the European Medicines Agency is in the process of evaluating Novartis's Bexsero, the first commercial vaccine developed using the reverse vaccinology approach. The vaccine may become the first vaccine effectively to combat meningococcus B, a disease causing over 50 % of global meningococcal meningitis. A decision on Bexsero is expected shortly. \n\nDuring the development of Bexsero, new protective protein antigens were identified using genomics: initially over 600 surface-exposed proteins were predicted from the N. meningitidis proteome as molecules liable to host immune surveillance, of which about 350 were then expressed in E. coli. This number was reduced by using these proteins to immunize 350 sets of mice, identifying 91 that could induce antibodies in vivo, 29 of which killed N. meningitidis in vitro. By comparing the genomes of 31 clinical strains, a further subset of proteins offering broad protection could be identified. \n\nReverse vaccinology has become perhaps the most famous well-developed approach amongst many advanced approaches now available within the discipline of vaccinology. Indeed, a whole range of other, high-technology methods and techniques have been and are being developed to complement and optimise reverse vaccinology. Capitalising on its success, these offer new hope in our constant struggle with infection; all we need is for this technology to be fostered, developed, and utilised. This book is intended to fill a gap, if not a void, in current thinking within vaccine design and development by attempting to draw together several disparate strands; and, by doing so, also identify and illuminate some important areas replete with potential. Science, in much the same way that all human activities, from the most profound to the most trivial, follows fashion and progresses by tracking trends. Whether we think of publically funded science or the pharmaceutical industry, similar phenomena are observed. Science follows the money, and money follows consensus.",

This strategy for vaccine candidate selection has often proved to be laborious and time-consuming and relies on the assumption (not always true) that protective antigens are the ones that elicit immune responses during natural infections. \n\nThe advent of genomics and postgenomics, together with the development of high throughput technologies for gene cloning and expression and protein purification, have allowed researchers to take a brute force approach according to which libraries of recombinant proteins representing a large fraction of the entire proteome of any given pathogen can be produced and screened in appropriate surrogate of protection assays. This approach, first attempted by Ling Lissolo and co-workers (36), proved to be very effective for vaccine development against a number of bacterial pathogens, including Meningococcus B (5, 37), Group B Streptococcus (6), and Staphylococcus aureus (38), but also showed a few severe drawbacks. In particular, several hundred proteins for each pathogen have to be expressed, purified, and tested in appropriate animal models; this latter step was the real bottleneck of the entire process. \n\nBecause all subunit-based vaccines eliciting protective antibody responses fall in the category of secreted proteins and highly expressed, surface-exposed proteins (5,6), a reliable experimental method capable of selectively identifying these two categories of antigens would substantially reduce the number of candidates to be tested in protection assays and ultimately speed up the whole vaccine discovery process. We have recently proposed a novel proteomics-based approach for the characterization of surface-exposed proteins in GAS that is based on the treatment of whole bacteria with proteases to selectively digest protein domains sticking out of the cell surface. The proteins identified in that study were all surface-associated and included most of the protective anti-gens described previously as well as a new potential vaccine candidate (7).",

The presence of many virulence factors in the genome of EHEC O157:H7 has hampered the identification of critical immunogenic antigens ideal for the development of an effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine (17)(18)(19). \n\nPrevious approaches to develop an effective vaccine against EHEC O157:H7 infections have exploited several novel and traditional methods, using chimeric proteins, virus-like particles, ghost bacterial cells, or conjugate vaccines (18,19). However, although some have been tested in clinical studies, to date none have been licensed for human use. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing and advances in bioinformatics, the vaccinology field has advanced to identify ideal antigens. Approaches like reverse vaccinology are primarily based on the scanning of an annotated genome from a pathogen of interest using bioinformatic prediction tools to identify immunogenic antigens, and this novel technology has enabled the vaccinology field to increase the breath of promising candidates and advance in the development of safe and broadly protective vaccines against several bacterial pathogens (20)(21)(22). Significant efforts have been made to identify effective vaccine candidates against EHEC O157:H7 and other diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes, although none are licensed for human use. Moreover, some shortcomings of recent attempts have been the inability to show significant protection in an in vivo model and limited use of EHEC-specific antigens that can provide broad protection. Using a bio-and immunoinformatic analysis (17,23,24), we have previously identified several EHEC O157:H7-specific surface-exposed antigens containing several B-and T-cell-predicted epitopes, which were selected as topranked predicted immunogens.",

            "text": "Several strategies have been devised to identify novel vaccine antigens. Rappuoli and colleagues pioneered the use of reverse vaccinology to identify novel antigens against Neisseria meningitides serogroup B [13,14] as addressed in Section 4.1. This approach involved mining the sequenced genome to identify any surface-expressed proteins based on the presence of signal peptides, and subsequently evaluating the identified antigens for immunogenicity in mice. This predictive approach led to the development of the Men B vaccine, Bexero \u00ae licensed in 2013 which has had a significant impact on meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. While this approach has revolutionized vaccine antigen discovery, one key limitation relates to the costs associated with testing the vast array of surface proteins identified (e.g., 350 antigens in the case of meningococcal B (MenB)), all of which were tested in mice. Alternative approaches exploit bacterial host interactions including identification of immunoreactive proteins via immunoproteomic approaches or identifying protein-protein interactions. The former approach typically involves probing two dimensional blots prepared from bacterial proteins with serum from infected patients or animals to identify immunoreactive proteins that stimulate serological antibody responses. One limitation of this method is that humoral responses may not be ultimately protective, and identification of potential subunit antigens based on stimulation of a serological response may not identify protective antigens [15]. More recently immunoproteomic studies incorporating antigen processing and presentation elements allowed identification of vaccine antigens that stimulate helper and cytotoxic effector immune responses in addition to humoral responses and consequently may show more effective immune protection [16]. This involves immunoprecipitation of viral infected cell lysates by affinity chromatography with specific anti-HLA mAbs, subsequent purification and mass spectrometry. \n\nIdentification of bacterial proteins involved in host cell attachment represents another approach to the identification of subunit vaccine antigens capable of stimulating both humoral and cellular responses.",

A subunit approach is currently in use for multivalent pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines. In another strategy to develop broad coverage, cross-protective vaccines can use highly conserved protein antigens produced through recombinant technology [140][141][142]. Proper antigens can be selected using bioinformatics analysis of whole-genome sequences and reverse vaccinology [143]. Examples of highly conserved Salmonella protein antigens include flagellin and porins (i.e., OmpC, F, and D). Both recombinant and purified protein vaccine candidates have been tested against conserved protein epitopes [2]. Subunit vaccines can induce both T-cell responses and antibody production; a balanced Th1-Th2 approach is vital to proper clearance of Salmonella. One of the downsides of subunit vaccines developed through recombinant technology is that it is difficult to maintain and preserve the proper conformation of proteins, especially when there are several membrane-spanning domains. This can result in the induction of a poor antibody response. One approach is to purify proteins from whole Salmonella cells rather than relying on recombinant proteins [142].",

            "text": "Vaccination is the preventive method of choice to fight against microbial pathogens and presents the best cost/benefit ratio among current clinical and pharmaceutical practices. There are many reasons and serious threats which make the development of new advanced vaccines necessary, for example, avian flu the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens [1]. \n\nThe advent of genomics and high-throughput cloning/expression of large sets of genomic ORFs from pathogens makes genome-wide searches of new vaccine candidates possible. This systematic identification of potential antigens and virulence factors of a pathogen without the need for its cultivation has been termed ''reverse vaccinology'' [2,3]. The objective is to find proteins eliciting antibodies capable of binding to the bacterial surface, and through interaction with the complement system kill certain pathogen microorganisms. However, current studies show that only a small fraction of the pathogen proteins, most surfaceexposed or secreted, appears to elicit antibodies with bactericidal activity [2,3]. It is generally considered that a bactericidal assay, that is, an antigen that elicits murine antibodies capable of triggering bacterial-cell death in vitro in a complement-dependent manner, is a good candidate for human vaccine development [4][5][6][7]. However, a major obstacle to reverse vaccinology, besides sequence and antigenic variability, is the difficulty to identify, from the pathogen proteome, those proteins that will generate a protective response. Typically, only a very small fraction of the antibodies raised in large-scale antigen-screening studies are bactericidal [3,8,9]. \n\nEpitope mimicry appears when a stretch of shared sequence, called ''mimetope'', exists between a protein of a certain pathogen and a protein of its host. In some cases this may lead to autoimmune phenomena most of them related to several diseases.",

            "text": "Influenza is one of the best examples on how omics, more precisely genomics, is revolutionizing vaccine design. Dedicated databases detailing complete and accurate influenza genomic information have been created and can be readily accessed worldwide (McHardy & Adams, 2009). In the last decade, this vast wealth of data has been translated into knowledge, which, in conjunction with synthetic biology, has aided the design of VLP vaccine candidates (Prabakaran et al., 2010;Pushko et al., 2011;Pushko et al., 2017). These novel biological entities are undoubtedly safer with the potential to be more broadly reactive than their previous counterparts (i.e., traditional, commercially available live attenuated influenza vaccines). \n\nSeveral genomic applications aid in the identification of novel antigens (Liao et al., 2017), namely, reverse vaccinology and comparative and functional genomics. Reverse vaccinology combines genomics with proteomics and bioinformatics to identify virtually all potentially protective antigens from coding regions within the genome (Bambini & Rappuoli, 2009;Rappuoli, 2007). Comparative genomics is primarily used to design broadly protective vaccines as it allows comparison of conserved and variable open reading frames within the same species. Functional genomics allows the identification of protein function based on reverse genetic evaluation (mutations and knockouts) or gene expression analysis (transcriptomics; Bagnoli et al., 2011;Bambini & Rappuoli, 2009;Rappuoli, 2007;Sette & Rappuoli, 2010). Although genomics per se has contributed significantly to the design of many vaccine candidates, such as influenza (Prabakaran et al., 2010;Pushko et al., 2011;Pushko et al., 2017), malaria (Draper et al., 2015;Y. Wu, Narum, Fleury, Jennings, & Yadava, 2015), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Calazans, Boggiano, & Lindsay, 2017), its full potential for vaccine development can only be realized when integrated with proteomics and immunomics (Bagnoli et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Undoubtedly, the traditional approaches for vaccine development are fortunate enough to efficiently resist the alarming pathogenic diseases of its time. However, the traditional approach suffers from certain limitations like it is very timeconsuming, the pathogens which can't be cultivated in the lab conditions are out of reach, and certain non-abundant proteins are not accessible using this approach (Rappuoli 2000). Consequently, a number of pathogenic diseases are left without any vaccine against them. All these limitations are conquered by reverse vaccinology approach utilizing genome sequence information which ultimately is translated into proteins. Hence all the proteins expressed by the genome are accessible irrespective of their abundance, conditions in which they expressed. The credit of fame of reverse vaccinology should go to the advancements in the sequencing strategies worldwide. Accordingly, improvement in the sequencing technologies has flooded the genome databases with huge amount of data which can be computationally undertaken to reveal the various crucial aspects of the virulence factors of the concerned pathogen. Reverse vaccinology is based on same approach of computationally analysing the genome of pathogen and proceeds step by step to ultimately identify the highly antigenic, secreted proteins with high epitope densities. The best epitopes are selected as potential vaccine candidates (Pizza et al. 2000). This approach has brought the unapproachable pathogens of interest in spotlight and is evolving as the most reassuring tool for precise selection of vaccine candidates and brought the use of peptide vaccines in trend (Sette and Rappuoli 2010;Kanampalliwar et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Reverse Vaccinology (RV) is a genome-based approach developed for the first time in early 1990's by Rappuoli (3) to identify meningococcal protein vaccine candidates in Group B meningococcus (MenB). In its original conception, since antigens inducing humoral antibody response are primarily located in extracellular or outer membrane district, all the open reading frames extracted from the genome sequence of MenB strain MC58 were screened to select proteins predicted to be surface exposed, secreted or lipoproteins. \n\nRV approach has revolutionized vaccine development by adopting computerized screening of protein sequences from the pathogen as the first step of the process, to select a subset of promising antigens, aka potential vaccine candidates (PVCs) (Figure 1A). \n\nRV offers two main advantages compared to traditional vaccine development approaches: (i) identification of candidate antigens without the need to grow the pathogen (ii) identification of any antigen independently by its purified quantity to be suitable for vaccine testing. \n\nProteins returned by RV methods are called throughout this review PVCs (Potential Vaccine Candidates). Other names given to the selected proteins are VCs (Vaccine Candidates), VTs (Vaccine Targets), PVCs (Protein Vaccine Candidates). PVCs identified by RV undergo in-vitro and in-vivo validation through experimental assays aimed at confirming their protective potential. Each pathogen has its specific experimental assays and it is hard to standardize a common set of experimental features; the most common experimental evidences are the protection outcomes in animal models against virulent bacterial challenge or results obtained from correlate to protection like the human bactericidal assay (4). In the context of this review we refer to any candidate protein that gave positive results in confirmatory preclinical experimental assays as BPAs (bacterial protective antigens). In the literature synonymous of BPAs are protective antigens (PAg), known antigens (KA), or known protective antigens (KPA). Lists of BPAs for different bacteria or viruses might be found in databases like Violin (Protegen) (5) or mining the literature. A comprehensive review of the main biological features characterizing BPAs deposited in Violin (Protegen) might be found in Ong et al. (6).",

            "text": "The aforementioned studies on the antibody indicate that these recombinant flagellar proteins have huge potential for novel targets of vaccine development (Rana et al., 2018). In addition, it is expected that these recombinant proteins can provide us with an extremely useful instrument for examining the host immune response to C. jejuni. Therefore, we have opted for the C. jejuni Omp18, AhpC, and FlgH for the preliminary study on the MAP vaccine. \n\nThe MAP vaccine is composed of the epitope peptide and the high-molecular artificial polymer carrier. The critical step is to screen and obtain the dominant epitope. During the production of antibodies such as IgG, high-titer IgG, these antibodies can only be produced with the assistance of T-cells. Unlike viruses, bacterial surface antigens feature intricate and varying structures. As a result, oftentimes it is hard for the genetically engineered vaccines with a single protein antigen to achieve the optimal effects of immune protection. The reverse vaccinology provides a new strategy of vaccine development in the early twentyfirst century (Fimlaid et al., 2014). At the core of the strategy is to obtain vaccine effective antigens in a swift and reliable manner through genome and proteomics prediction, and the reverse screening is adopted for the antibody. In addition, although it is a vaccine applicable to humans, the results of animal protection experiments must be provided during its development, whereas mice are regarded as the most commonly used experimental animals. \n\nTherefore, in this study, we have adopted the biological information technology to predict the T-B combined epitope in human and mouse Omp18, AhpC, and FlgH, and screened the dominant T-B combined epitope by ELISA and Western Blot. Subsequently, the artificial tandem epitope of AhpC-2/Omp18-1/FlgH-1 was established before being recombined and expressed in success, so that the yield was further improved. Moreover, the antigenicity and stability were effectively enhanced due to the fact that the recombined epitope peptide featured a larger molecular weight.",

Reverse vaccinology has also become an essential tool for several vaccine development projects against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., C. pneumoniae, streptococci). The potential and speed of genomic-based approaches was also shown when the nucleotide sequence of the coronavirus causing SARS was made available in less than one month. In addition, the increasing number of available genomes from bacteria and viruses would allow comparative genomic studies, thereby providing hints on conserved protein families and/or functional domains. This would facilitate the generation of vaccines using immunogens covering multiple micro-organisms [125]. Despite the incredible potential of reverse vaccinology, this approach also has some important limitations (Tab. 1). Among them is the fact that it is not be possible to identify non-protein antigens (e.g., PS, glycolipids), which are the cornerstone for many successful vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal and Hib vaccines).",

            "text": "This comprehensive review illuminates the unique perspective of phage display, establishing a direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development to address a specific gap in the field. In Section 3.5, practical examples of epitope identification are presented using two key components, a phage display peptide or genome fragment library and samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. Successful identification of pathogen epitopes has been achieved by using antibodies from these patients. However, there is currently no example where phage display-based epitope identification has been followed by direct utilization of the identified and isolated phage clone as a vaccine. Only one clinical trial has been conducted using M13 vaccine for cancer patients [85]. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, proving particularly advantageous in critical scenarios such as pandemics. Notably, the timeline from selection to preclinical or clinical trials is significantly compressed, enabling the acquisition of a viable vaccine product within a matter of months instead of years. The review underscores the numerous advantages offered by phage display, encompassing expedited processes such as panning, characterization, sequencing, phage production, and endotoxin removal. By bridging this crucial knowledge gap, the review delivers invaluable insights into the remarkable potential of phage display for swift vaccine development. Undoubtedly, phage-based vaccines have the power to revolutionize the field of vaccinology, boasting immunogenic carrier capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and customization options that position them as a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. While further refinement and validation remain imperative, the advancements in phage display technology hold immense promise for the creation of precise and potent vaccines against infectious diseases.",

The need to find highly conserved antigens for a universal meningococcal B vaccine has led to a pioneering approach called reverse vaccinology that takes advantage of the availability of the complete genome sequences of N. meningitidis to help define novel antigens as vaccine candidates (in silico analysis to define conserved surface-located meningococcal proteins). Subsequently, these vaccine candidates can be confirmed (or not) experimentally through cloning, expression of the corresponding genes, and immunization with purified proteins. 44 Indeed, genomic analysis allowed the identification of a \"cocktail\" of several proteins that can be used for a universal vaccine against N. meningitis and in particular those belonging to serogroup B. 45,46 Using this approach, the Chiron Company (now Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) exploited the data of the complete genome of serogroup B MC58 meningococcal strain generated by Tettelin et al 47 to identify several proteins as vaccine candidates. They were used to develop a new recombinant vaccine that can target meningococcal isolates of serogroup B. This vaccine went through several stages of development. 46 Five components were first identified (GNA1870, GNA2132, NadA, GNA1030, and GNA2091) and were evaluated for their immunogenicity alone or taken together in a five-component vaccine against MenB (5CVMB). In preclinical studies, these proteins have shown the potential to protect against a broad range of disease-causing meningococcal B strains using sera obtained from immunized mice. 48 Three of these proteins were found to be immunogenic and induced a bactericidal immune response: GNA1870 (also known as factor-H binding protein), GNA2132 (also known as Neisseria heparin-binding antigen [NHBA]), and the meningococcal adhesion, NadA. 48",

The core vaccine proteins were identified using pan-proteome analysis and used for broad spectrum epitopes prioritization [23]. Further, it was ensured that the selected epitopes are vital for the pathogen survival that are not human homologs, and are exposed to the host immune system for efficient recognition and processing.

            "text": "Newer vaccine development techniques, such as recombinant DNA technology or viral vector vaccines, may offer advantages in terms of efficacy and safety. Computational vaccinology and in-silico prediction of the host's immune response to pathogens/antigens can expedite the development of novel vaccines. Epitope-based vaccines, which target specific antigenic regions of the pathogen, offer a promising approach to vaccine development termed 'reverse vaccinology' due to their potential for inducing targeted immune responses while minimizing side effects (Rappuoli, 2000). Computational epitope prediction and immuno-informatics can hasten the design and development of multi-epitope vaccines (Pizza et al., 2000;Masignani, Pizza & Moxon, 2019). Molecular docking and molecular simulations aid in understanding the binding potential of in-silico designed vaccine with host immune cell receptors (Rappuoli et al., 2016). Immunoinformatics has been gainfully employed for designing multi-epitope vaccine candidates against KFDV (with a relatively smaller set of genome sequences) and to understand the molecular interactions between the host receptors and virus protein recently (Arumugam & Varamballi, 2021;Dey et al., 2023;Hafeez et al., 2023). The present work is a comprehensive phylogenomic and immunoinformatics analysis of KFDV based on 73 genome sequences to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate based on a major antigenic protein, which is an envelope protein.

            "text": "Despite many decades of research, an effective vaccine for some pathogens, including those causing malaria, remains elusive [41]. The reverse vaccinology approach, in which the genome of an organism is examined to identify novel antigens, has brought about a new generation of vaccine candidates [42,43]. Advances in multi-strain genome sequencing have enabled not only the identification of novel surface antigens, but also the ability to discern polymorphic and conserved regions. However, vaccines designed using protein sequence alone are not likely to induce optimal antibody responses to pathogen antigens in their native state. The application of structural vaccinology may be the next step in rational vaccine design. Similar to structure-based drug design [44,45], the structural vaccinology strategy employs structural data from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and/or cryo-EM to inform the rational design of novel vaccine antigens. \n\nCurrently, the use of structure-based vaccine design in malaria or disordered antigens is sparse. One study of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from Plasmodium falciparum detailed the structure of the immunodominant NANP repeat region when complexed with functional antibodies elicited by RTS,S vaccinees [46,47]. In that study the same peptide epitope was found to adopt different conformations when bound to different antibodies. Such structural insights may provide a rationale for structure-based antigen design to improve the efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine. Early applications in other diseases, involving the grafting of multiple electrostatic surfaces from Neisseria meningitidis variants onto chimeric antigens have shown promise and were able to elicit a cross-protective immune response [24]. In the HIV field, a key epitope recognised by the broadly neutralising antibody 2F5 was stabilised using protein scaffolds [30,48,49]. Although antibodies with similar binding to 2F5 were elicited when the antigen was used to immunise guinea pigs, the project faltered at later stages when these antibodies were unable to neutralise HIV. Crystal structures have also been used to assist in the design of respiratory syncytial virus antigens stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation [26].",

However, thanks to the advent of whole genome sequencing technologies, the whole proteome of a pathogen can now be screened for promising protective antigens using in silico immunoinformatics tools followed by expression of the candidates and confirming their immunogenicity through in vivo experiments, a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\" [21]. The latter approach is free from the pitfalls pertinent to the conventional approach. Moreover, it saves time, money, and effort that would otherwise be wasted in unworthy experimental trials [22,23]. \n\nThe efficacy of several PA iron acquisition proteins-hereafter termed (IAPs)-as vaccine targets has been previously tested [24][25][26][27]. However, as far as we know, this is the first study to employ a systematic, inverted pyramid vaccine target selection approach, focusing only on IAPs and involving several selection criteria. The literature was searched for all IAPs, followed by classification of IAPs based on iron acquisition mechanism. Then, seven published transcriptomic analyses were screened to choose the most highly expressed IAPs [25,[28][29][30][31][32][33]. Furthermore, IAPs were subjected to extensive in silico analysis, whereby antigenicity, water solubility, conservation among PA strains, and homology to human and mouse proteins were assessed. Finally, the antigen with the best scoring was recombinantly expressed and subjected to in vivo assessment in combination with the novel immunoadjuvant, naloxone (NAL) [34].",

Recombinant protein subunit vaccines avoid potential issues with purified macromolecule subunit vaccines, including co-purification of undesired contaminants or reversal of toxoids to toxigenic forms and interference between multivalent formulation components [141][142][143]. Thus, recombinant DNA technology has been proposed for expressing orthohantavirus proteins for hantavirus subunit vaccine development [144,145]. Recombinant DOBV nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) in mice induced a strong NP-specific IgG response and mixed Th1/Th2cell involvement [146]. DOBV rNPs conjugated with recombinant rP40 (the Klebsiella pneumoniae outer membrane protein A) showed higher NP-specific antibody responses. Immunogenicity of PUUV rNP-rP40 was characterized [147]. Recombinant PUUV proteins were expressed in E. coli 200. The truncated construct, P40-Puu118, gave high antibody titers after two doses and 100% protection after three doses, suggesting potential as a subunit vaccine against PUUV [148]. \n\nRecent years have witnessed significant advancements in both immune protection technology and bioinformatics, particularly high-throughput sequencing technology, accelerating the development of multi-epitope subunit vaccines through the reverse-vaccinology approach. In 2022, Ismail screened 340 epitopes from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), identifying 10 epitopes for potential inclusion in a potent multiantigenic epitope subunit vaccine. These epitopes were linked through specific GPGPG linkers to create a computationally designed vaccine [149]. This vaccine was then computationally combined with three different adjuvants to stimulate immune responses. A major limitation of that study is the lack of experimental validation.",

            "text": "Novel technologies currently under investigation represent the most valuable tools to be applied in vaccinology and could be used today for addressing the medical needs of the twenty-first century. Despite decades of efforts and investigation, satisfactory vaccines have not yet been developed against several of the most life-threatening infections, including tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, which claim the lives of more than 4 million people worldwide each year. The high levels of variability of their antigenic proteins and the required induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses have not allowed us to use conventional vaccinology methods as successful strategies. The advent of a new approach, named structural vaccinology, could represent today a valid revolutionary alternative leading in the next years to an efficacious vaccine design. Through the combination of human immunology, structural biology, and bioinformatics knowledge, antigenic epitopes are identified based on the protein amino acid sequences and the resulting secondary and tertiary structures. The principle is based on the observation that an efficacious immune response does not require the recognition of the entire antigenic protein, but the recognition of multiple selected epitopes might be sufficient to induce protective immunity (42). Progresses in technologies aimed at interrogating the human B cell repertoire are providing for the first time the possibility of isolating broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting relevant conserved epitopes (43)(44)(45). A deeper characterization of the crystal structure of an antigen in complex with protective antibodies represents the launching point for immunogen design to select relevant epitopes from a vaccine standpoint. Once identified they can be expressed in a recombinant form and in an immunodominant fashion to be used as potent immunogens (Figure 2). Recently, the group of Kwong et al. (46) using a structure-based approach designed an immunogen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that elicits higher protective responses than the postfusion form of the fusion glycoprotein, which is one of the current leading RSV vaccine candidates entering clinical trials. Importantly, highly protective responses were elicited in both mice and macaques. Structural vaccinology combined with human immunology are therefore rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative strategy for the rational design of engineered vaccines bearing multiple antigenic epitopes offering the opportunity",

            "text": "Through immunization, many lives have been saved, lowering medical expenses and raising living standards. However, the effects of conventional vaccination designs on human immune systems still need to be better understood. Regarding newly emerging human viral infections, several immune-related aspects need to be considered. Advanced reverse vaccinology techniques enable targeted adaptive immune response activation. Using the epitope prediction method, several vaccines have been developed to protect against human illnesses. This has entailed developing a potential vaccine candidate based on the epitope (AMA-1) against \"Plasmodium vivax\". A recently developed multi-epitope vaccine with a strong IgG antibody-specific immunological response against \"Acinetobacter baumannii\" was evaluated in mice in 2019. Additionally, it was confirmed that theoretically anticipated B cell epitopes are efficient at detecting \"Trypsonoma vivax\". Examples of deadly human viruses that have been combated with comparable tactics, include the Mokola Rabies virus, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, the Marburg virus, and the Ebola virus [73][74][75]. \n\nTCRs identify antigens displayed on the surface of APCs that have MHC receptors (classified as class I and II) on their surface. These antigens are recognized by the cytotoxic and helper T-cells, respectively. BCRs bind antigens from foreign particles and induce B cell maturity and differentiation that leads to the release of antibodies [50]. \n\nFor instance, computational biology helps to unveil the molecular mechanism and discovery of new drugs, vaccines, or peptides for different pathogens [76][77][78][79][80]. Epitope-based mRNA vaccines developed using computational biology approaches have addressed some of the aforementioned characteristics since the very beginning of the development process. The computer-guided design of vaccines has a number of benefits, but one drawback of our method was that it could only predict linear epitopes, which leaves out the conformational ones from the assembly.",

            "title": "Reverse Vaccinology: An Approach for Identifying Leptospiral Vaccine Candidates",
            "text": "The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology and the subsequent cost reduction associated with DNA sequencing has led to a significant increase in the number of genome sequencing projects, in both public and private sectors. This has led to a demand for new bioinformatics tools to keep up with the ever-increasing amounts of sequence data being generated. The availability of these new bioinformatics tools, together with the failure to develop a vaccine against meningococcus B during the 1990s, led Rino Rappuoli and colleagues to propose a process for the identification of vaccine candidates directly from the genome sequence [6]. They coined the term \"reverse vaccinology\" to describe this novel approach that starts with the genome rather than a laboratory grown pathogen. As it is not feasible to evaluate all of the thousands of proteins encoded in a genome, a process was developed to screen for proteins that were likely to be exposed on the surface of the target microorganism. It was based on the prediction of protein structural features, such as: integral transmembrane \u03b2-barrel arrangements; transmembrane alpha-helices; signal peptides; lipoprotein lipoboxes; and secreted proteins. The original bioinformatics software and recent advances applicable to RV have been reviewed extensively elsewhere; see, e.g., [67,68]. This provided a rigorous analysis and the identification of candidate antigens for subsequent evaluation in the laboratory. The technique was originally proposed almost 20 years ago, and the first vaccine discovered using the RV process was licensed in Europe in 2012. Appropriately, it was the 4CMenB vaccine for the control of meningococcal B disease, now marketed worldwide as Bexsero by GlaxoSmithKline [63]. The reverse vaccinology process (RV) has been applied to a diverse range of infectious diseases including: malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniosis and leptospirosis. However, the success of the approach requires, in addition to a genome sequence, a high-throughput cloning strategy, an animal model and in vitro screening assays to rapidly evaluate the potentially hundreds of vaccine candidates identified during the bioinformatics step. The RV process is summarized as applied to Leptospira spp.; see Figure 2. \n\nInt. J. Mol.",

            "text": "The achievements in gene engineering have dramatically influenced the construction of vaccines. Since the 1980s, recombinant technologies have been introduced for the development of different vaccine types, such as live and attenuated recombinant bacteria and viruses, as well as the production of toxins and other protein antigens using recombinant hosts [8]. \n\nThe hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine was the first subunit vaccine, and it was generated by gene engineering techniques more than 30 years ago. The expression of a cloned copy of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in yeast cells resulted in the production of noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) [10] and allowed the replacement of a previously generated plasma-derived vaccine [11]. The success of HBV vaccines strongly stimulated the development of recombinant vaccines based on viral structural proteins and marked the beginning of a new era in rationally designed VLP platforms for the generation of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [12]. \n\nUsing the same principle of viral coat protein (CP) expression in heterologous hosts, vaccines against cervical cancer (Gardasil and Cervarix; [13-15]), hepatitis A (Hecolin; [16]) and malaria (RTS,S; [17]) were constructed, clinically tested and licensed for human use in the subsequent decades. It is important to stress that the RTS,S vaccine is the first among licensed vaccines containing a VLP carrier (HBsAg) with an incorporated foreign antigen (CS). \n\nArtificial virus-like structures derived from plant virus proteins are well known due to virus assembly studies performed since the 1950s [18]. Based on the use of carrier proteins with chemically coupled peptide antigens as promising vaccine candidates [19], Haynes et al. [20] generated an experimental vaccine using a gene engineering approach instead of chemical coupling. They combined the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) CP gene with an extension encoding a C-terminally located, 8 AA-long antigenic peptide from poliovirus. The resulting VLPs purified from recombinant bacterial cells were immunogenic and stimulated the formation of antibodies against poliovirus in rats.",

            "text": "Among non-antibiotic therapies, vaccine development is a strategy of choice but, to date, there is no universal or specific licensed vaccine against InPEC. \n\nFor years, vaccine development has included various platforms and approaches, such as (i) pathogens attenuated by exposure to different environmental conditions (heat or oxygen) or by multiple passages in culture media (in vitro), a method considered as the most ancient and empirical form of vaccine production; (ii) detoxified toxin forms, like the detoxified version of the diphtheria and tetanus toxins; (iii) the use of protein-based vaccines, as hemagglutinin from influenza virus or the vaccine for Bordetella pertussis; (iv) genetically engineered vaccines, which have been the most used alternative to vaccine development, in which antigens can be produced in different vectors that reduce toxicity or collateral immunoreactions (Mora et al., 2003;Plotkin, 2014). \n\nHowever, there are several infectious diseases for which these traditional approaches have failed and for which vaccines have not yet been developed. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing and advances in bioinformatics, the vaccinology field has changed. Approaches like reverse vaccinology, based on the scanning of the annotated complete pathogen genome by bioinformatic prediction of the most likely vaccine candidates, have enabled identification of promising antigens and the development of a safe broadly protective vaccine against the Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B pathogen (Pizza et al., 2000;Giuliani et al., 2006;Feavers and Maiden, 2017). For other pathogens such as Streptococcus ssp., and for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), a number of promising antigens have also been identified (De Gregorio and Rappuoli, 2012;Sjoling et al., 2015). In particular, for ExPEC the genome sequence analysis of a neonatal meningitis isolate (NMEC) enabled the identification of 230 potential antigens.",

Currently, a fully effective and long-lasting preventive malaria vaccine is still elusive therefore more effort is needed to identify better effective vaccine candidates. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize hypothetical proteins as vaccine candidates derived from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 genome by reverse vaccinology. Of the 23 selected hypothetical proteins, 5 were predicted on the extracellular localization by WoLFPSORTv.2.0 program and all the 5 had less than 2 transmembrane regions that were predicted by TMHMMv2.0 and HMMTOP programs at default settings. Two out of the five proteins lacked secretory signal peptides as predicted by SignalP program. Among the 5 extracellular proteins, 3 were predicted to be antigenic by VaxiJen (score \u2265 0.5) and had negative GRAVY values ranging from \u2212 1.156 to \u2212 0.440. B cell epitope prediction by ABCpred and BCpred programs revealed a total of 15 antigenic epitopes. A total of 13 cytotoxic T cells were predicted from the 3 proteins using CTLPred online server.

Five HTL peptides from XP_001351030.1 protein are predicted inducers of all the three cytokines. STRING protein\u2013protein network analysis of HPs revealed XP_001350955.1 closely interacts with nucleoside diphosphate kinase (PF13-0349) at 0.704, XP_001351030.1 interacts with male development protein1 (Mdv-1) at 0.645, and XP_001351047.1 with an uncharacterized protein (MAL8P1.53) at 0.400. Reverse vaccinology is a promising strategy for the screening and identification of antigenic antigens with potential capacity to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against P. falciparum infection. In this study, potential vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum were identified and screened using standard bioinformatics tools. The vaccine candidates contained antigenic and immunogenic epitopes which could be considered for novel and effective vaccine targets. However, we strongly recommend in vivo and in vitro experiments to validate their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to completely decipher the vaccine targets against malaria.",

In this study, a reverse vaccinology approach was designed to achieve a rational selection of cat flea candidate protective antigens. Based on transcriptomics and proteomics data from unfed adult fleas it was possible to select more specific candidate protective antigens based on highly represented and functionally relevant proteins present in the predicted exoproteome. The protective capacity of the recombinant antigens was evaluated for the control of C. felis infestations in vaccinated cats. Vaccination with recombinant antigens induced an antibody response in immunized cats. Furthermore, a correlation was obtained between the effect of vaccination (antibody levels) and vaccine efficacy on flea phenotype (egg hatchability). The results suggested that the main effect of vaccination with these antigens was on reducing cat flea egg hatchability and fertility, with an overall vaccine efficacy of 32\u201346%. Although vaccination with these antigens did not have an effect on flea infestations, vaccines affecting reproductive capacity could reduce cat flea populations, particularly under conditions of direct insect transmission between cats. These results support the development of vaccines with protective antigens affecting flea reproduction and development after feeding on immunized animals for the control of cat flea infestations.",

Thousands of people die every year due to leptospirosis, especially in developing countries with tropical climates. Prophylaxis is difficult due to multiple factors, including the large number of asymptomatic hosts that transmit the bacteria, poor sanitation, increasing numbers of slum dwellers, and the lack of an effective vaccine. Several leptospiral recombinant antigens were evaluated as a replacement for the inactivated (bacterin) vaccine; however, success has been limited. A prospective vaccine candidate is likely to be a surface-related protein that can stimulate the host immune response to clear leptospires from blood and organs. In this study, a comprehensive bioinformatics approach based on reverse and structural vaccinology was applied toward the discovery of novel leptospiral vaccine candidates. The Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 genome was mined in silico for the enhanced identification of conserved \u03b2-barrel (\u03b2b) transmembrane proteins and outer membrane (OM) lipoproteins. Orthologs of the prospective vaccine candidates were screened in the genomes of 20 additional Leptospira spp. Three-dimensional structural models, with a high degree of confidence, were created for each of the surface-exposed proteins. Major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) epitopes were identified, and their locations were mapped on the structural models. A total of 18 \u03b2b transmembrane proteins and 8 OM lipoproteins were identified. These proteins were conserved among the pathogenic Leptospira spp. and were predicted to have epitopes for several variants of MHC-II receptors. A structural and functional analysis of the sequence of these surface proteins demonstrated that most \u03b2b transmembrane proteins seem to be TonB-dependent receptors associated with transportation. Other proteins identified included, e.g., TolC efflux pump proteins, a BamA-like OM component of the \u03b2b transmembrane protein assembly machinery, and the LptD-like LPS assembly protein. The structural mapping of the immunodominant epitopes identified the location of conserved, surface-exposed, immunogenic regions for each vaccine candidate. The proteins identified in this study are currently being evaluated for experimental evidence for their involvement in virulence, disease pathogenesis, and physiology, in addition to vaccine development.",

Historically, the process of vaccine development through to licensure requires decades; however, clinicians and public health officials are often faced with outbreaks of viral diseases, sometimes of a pandemic nature that would require vaccines for adequate control. New viral diseases emerge from zoonotic and vectorborne sources, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Chikungunya, and while these diseases are often detected in resource-rich countries, they usually begin in lowand mid-income countries.1 Therefore, part of the timeline for a vaccine involves surveillance and detection of new pathogens in remote areas and transfer of specimens to laboratories capable of vaccine development. Development of vaccines for viral infections has historically been an empirical and iterative process based on the use of attenuated or inactivated whole virus. This requires unique methods of cultivation for each virus, development of animal models for vaccine testing, and a prolonged process of fine-tuning product formulation and immunogenicity, and for live-attenuated vaccines, pathogenicity. Thus, preclinical vaccine development can take years, followed by several more years of early-phase clinical testing and defining of dose and schedule. Moreover, efficacy testing and registration with regulatory agencies often takes another 5 to 10 years. In total, 15 to 20 years would be a typical timeframe from virus discovery to vaccineavailability iftheprocessproceedssmoothlyandthere are no major biological or logistical challenges. Fortunately, during the last decade, there have been substantial technological advances for conceiving, developing, manufacturing, and delivering vaccines. Rapid genetic sequencing allows both early identification of new pathogens and the identity of the genes encoding structural proteins that can form the basis for vaccine immunogen development. Also, rapid isolation of human monoclonal antibodies has proven to be extremely helpful in defining epitopes that are the targets of protective immunity. Additional tools of modern vaccinology include (1) delineation of atomic-level structures of viral proteins that facilitates structure-enabled immunogen design and protein engineering; (2) cell sorting and sequencing technologies that allow single-cell analysis of immune responses; and (3) genetic knock-in technologies that allow construction of animal models with human antibody genes for vaccine testing. These tools have already provided the potential not only for solving longstanding problems in vaccinology, such as the development of a new candidate vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, but they have facilitated rapid development of new candidate vaccines for emerging pathogens such as the Zika virus and pandemic strains of influenza virus. Synthetic vaccinology and platform manufacturing are important innovations that can speed the initial vaccine immunogen design and vaccine development process, and shorten the time needed for manufacturing and initial regulatory approval to begin phase 1 testing. Synthetic vaccinology is the process of using viral gene sequence information to accelerate vaccine development.2 For example, if a new influenza virus emerges anywhere in the world and is identified through genomic sequencing, the digitally transferred information can be used to synthesize nucleic acids encoding the viral surface proteins (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). The process of gene synthesis is now extremely rapid and relatively inexpensive. Thus, within a few weeks, DNA plasmids encoding viral proteins can be available for preclinical testing. These genetic vectors (DNA and mRNA) can be used directly for immunization whereby intramuscular immunization leads to muscle cells producing the viral proteins. Alternatively, the genetic vectors can be used to express recombinant protein antigens, in vitro, that can be used for immunization. Similarly, if an outbreak of a new flavivirus becomes an epidemic or even a pandemic threat, as with Zika in 2015, the gene sequences that encode the viral surface proteins premembrane and envelope can be rapidly identified and form the basis for vaccine immunogen design strategies, based on prior knowledge of flavivirus structure and mechanisms of neutralization.3 Once a structurally authentic immunogen is available, the protein or genetic vectors encoding the protein can be used to immunize animals. In addition, the vaccine proteins can be used as probes to identify monoclonal antibodies secreted by B cells of convalescent humans. Such antibodies are valuable not only for refining vaccine immunogen designs, but also for development of diagnostic assays and potentially for use in passive transfer as therapeutic agents. Thus, development of reagents, diagnostics, candidate vaccines, and immune assessment assays can be done without having the actual virus in hand.

            "abstract": "Malaria is one of the most important and life-threatening infectious diseases worldwide. In 2015 malaria claimed about 429 000 lives, mostly among children below five year of age in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, and caused 212 million clinical episodes in a population of approximately 3.3 billion people living in regions at risk of infection. The development of an effective malaria vaccine is recognized as one of the most promising approaches for preventing infections and reducing transmission. To date, there is no vaccine on the market for prevention of malaria and only a few candidate vaccines were able to induce some protective efficacy. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate the pace of design and development of new malaria vaccine candidates that induce broad and long-lasting protective immunity. Reverse vaccinology and structural vaccinology are two complementary techniques that hold much promise in this regard. \nThe pathogenesis of malaria is primarily associated with blood-stage infection and there is strong evidence that antibodies specific for parasite blood-stage antigens can control parasitemia. This provides a strong rationale for incorporation of asexual blood-stage antigen components into an effective multivalent malaria subunit vaccine. \n \nIn this thesis, we exploited the great potential of the \u2018omics\u2019 sciences for the selection of hypothetical surface-exposed protein and the evaluation of their potential as vaccine candidate antigens. For the characterization of selected antigens we have exploited an entirely cell-based, rapid and reliable approach for the generation of antigen-specific and parasite cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): (I) generation of mammalian cell lines expressing high levels of the selected predicted malaria antigens as transmembrane proteins; (II) living\u00ad-cell immunization of mice; (III) generation of hybridoma cell lines producing mAbs capable of recognizing the endogenous antigen in its native context. \nThis strategy has led us to the identification of the Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-\u00adRich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) as promising blood\u00ad-stage malaria vaccine candidate: (I) PfCyRPA has limited natural immunogenicity, (II) is highly conserved among P. falciparum isolates and (III) forms together with the Reticulocyte-binding Homolog 5 (PfRH5) and the PfRH5-interacting Protein (PfRipr) a multiprotein complex crucial for P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion; (IV) PfCyRPA-specific mAbs showed parasite in vitro growth\u00ad-inhibitory activity due to inhibition of merozoite invasion; (V) passive immunization experiments in P. falciparum infected NOD\u00adscid IL2R\u03b3null mice engrafted with human erythrocytes demonstrated in vivo growth-\u00adinhibitory activity of PfCyRPA specific mAbs. \n \nTo investigate whether growth inhibitory anti\u00adPfCyRPA and anti\u00adPfRH5 Abs can be induced by active immunization with the adjuvanted recombinant proteins, PfCyRPA and PfRH5 were recombinantly expressed as soluble protein in mammalian and insect cells respectively, purified from culture supernatant and employed for immunization of mice. mAbs raised against recombinant PfCyRPA and PfRH5 proteins showed potent parasite growth-\u00adinhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in a vaccine. \n \nTo examine the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and to explore the dynamics of its surface loops, we generated co-crystals of it in complex with an inhibitory mAb and elucidated the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and of the epitope\u2013paratope interface by X-ray crystallography. Elucidation of the structure of the epitope recognized by the protective mAb will strongly facilitate design of peptidomimetics in a structural vaccinology approach. The overall structure of PfCyRPA is a six-bladed \u03b2-propeller with each blade of the propeller being a four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet. The five disulfide bonds of the protein are located within blades 1-5, stabilizing each individual blade. Since the 6th blade is composed of \u03b2-strands both from the N- and the C-terminus and has no disulfide bond, PfCyRPA has the potential to undergo large conformational changes by disassembly of blade 6. \n \nAmong additional hypothetical antigens investigated in the framework of this thesis, PF14_0044 showed interesting features: while none of the generated PF14_0044-specific mAbs significantly inhibited parasite growth, a synergistic in vitro inhibitory activity was observed when anti-PF14_0044 mAbs were combined with anti-PfCyRPA mAbs. Applying the principle of reverse vaccinology, we thus identified PfCyRPA and PF14_0044 as targets of merozoite invasion\u2010inhibitory antibodies. \nTaken together results show how a combination of reverse and structural vaccinology approaches can enable the identification of new target antigens for incorporation into subunit vaccines.",

Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate the pace of design and development of new malaria vaccine candidates that induce broad and long-lasting protective immunity. Reverse vaccinology and structural vaccinology are two complementary techniques that hold much promise in this regard. \nThe pathogenesis of malaria is primarily associated with blood-stage infection and there is strong evidence that antibodies specific for parasite blood-stage antigens can control parasitemia. This provides a strong rationale for incorporation of asexual blood-stage antigen components into an effective multivalent malaria subunit vaccine. \n \nIn this thesis, we exploited the great potential of the \u2018omics\u2019 sciences for the selection of hypothetical surface-exposed protein and the evaluation of their potential as vaccine candidate antigens. For the characterization of selected antigens we have exploited an entirely cell-based, rapid and reliable approach for the generation of antigen-specific and parasite cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): (I) generation of mammalian cell lines expressing high levels of the selected predicted malaria antigens as transmembrane proteins; (II) living\u00ad-cell immunization of mice; (III) generation of hybridoma cell lines producing mAbs capable of recognizing the endogenous antigen in its native context. \nThis strategy has led us to the identification of the Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-\u00adRich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) as promising blood\u00ad-stage malaria vaccine candidate: (I) PfCyRPA has limited natural immunogenicity, (II) is highly conserved among P. falciparum isolates and (III) forms together with the Reticulocyte-binding Homolog 5 (PfRH5) and the PfRH5-interacting Protein (PfRipr) a multiprotein complex crucial for P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion; (IV) PfCyRPA-specific mAbs showed parasite in vitro growth\u00ad-inhibitory activity due to inhibition of merozoite invasion; (V) passive immunization experiments in P. falciparum infected NOD\u00adscid IL2R\u03b3null mice engrafted with human erythrocytes demonstrated in vivo growth-\u00adinhibitory activity of PfCyRPA specific mAbs. \n \nTo investigate whether growth inhibitory anti\u00adPfCyRPA and anti\u00adPfRH5 Abs can be induced by active immunization with the adjuvanted recombinant proteins, PfCyRPA and PfRH5 were recombinantly expressed as soluble protein in mammalian and insect cells respectively, purified from culture supernatant and employed for immunization of mice. mAbs raised against recombinant PfCyRPA and PfRH5 proteins showed potent parasite growth-\u00adinhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in a vaccine. \n \nTo examine the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and to explore the dynamics of its surface loops, we generated co-crystals of it in complex with an inhibitory mAb and elucidated the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and of the epitope\u2013paratope interface by X-ray crystallography. Elucidation of the structure of the epitope recognized by the protective mAb will strongly facilitate design of peptidomimetics in a structural vaccinology approach. The overall structure of PfCyRPA is a six-bladed \u03b2-propeller with each blade of the propeller being a four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet. The five disulfide bonds of the protein are located within blades 1-5, stabilizing each individual blade. Since the 6th blade is composed of \u03b2-strands both from the N- and the C-terminus and has no disulfide bond, PfCyRPA has the potential to undergo large conformational changes by disassembly of blade 6. \n \nAmong additional hypothetical antigens investigated in the framework of this thesis, PF14_0044 showed interesting features: while none of the generated PF14_0044-specific mAbs significantly inhibited parasite growth, a synergistic in vitro inhibitory activity was observed when anti-PF14_0044 mAbs were combined with anti-PfCyRPA mAbs. Applying the principle of reverse vaccinology, we thus identified PfCyRPA and PF14_0044 as targets of merozoite invasion\u2010inhibitory antibodies. \nTaken together results show how a combination of reverse and structural vaccinology approaches can enable the identification of new target antigens for incorporation into subunit vaccines.",

Currently there are two major approaches for delivery of genetic material, viral and non-viral. The majority of on-going clinical trials in gene therapy or DNA vaccines use retroviruses and adenoviruses for delivering genetic materials. Viral delivery systems are far more effective than non-viral delivery however there are concerns regarding toxicity, immunogenicity and possible integration of viral genetic material into the human genome. Given the negative charge of the phosphate backbone of DNA, polycationic molecules have been the major focus as carriers of DNA. There are several physiological barriers to overcome for effective systemic delivery of DNA. The ideal vector must be stable in the systemic circulation, escape the reticuloendothelial system, able to extravasate tissues, enter the target cell, escape lysosomal degradation and transport DNA to the nucleus to be transcribed. With increasing understanding of the physicochemical properties essential to overcome the various barriers, it is possible to apply rational design to the cationic carriers. A number of poly-amino acids, cationic block co-polymers, dendrimers and cyclodextrins have been rationally designed to optimize gene delivery. This review will discuss approaches that have been used to design various synthetic polycations with enhanced DNA condensing ability, serum stability and endosomolytic capability for efficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo."

The HSV-1 strain 17 genome that contains 77 proteins was used as the seed genome. These 77 proteins are conserved in two other HSV-1 strains (strain F and strain H129). Two envelope glycoproteins gJ and gG do not have orthologs in HSV-2 or 8 other human herpesviruses. Seven HSV-1 proteins (including gJ and gG) do not have orthologs in all 40 non-human herpesviruses. Nineteen proteins are conserved in all human herpesviruses, including capsid scaffold protein UL26.5 (NP_044628.1). As the only HSV-1 protein predicted to be an adhesin, UL26.5 is a promising vaccine target. The MHC Class I and II epitopes were predicted by the Vaxign Vaxitop prediction program and IEDB prediction programs recently installed and incorporated in Vaxign. Our comparative analysis found that the two programs identified largely the same top epitopes but also some positive results predicted from one program might not be positive from another program. Overall, our Vaxign computational prediction provides many promising candidates for rational HSV vaccine development. The method is generic and can also be used to predict other viral vaccine targets."

The potential for seasonal protection arising from a single injection of antibodies is appealing and has been pursued for a number of infectious agents. However, until recently, antibody-based strategies to combat infectious agents have been hampered due to the fact that most antibodies have been found to be strain specific, with the virus evolving resistance in many cases. The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in influenza, dengue virus, and HIV, which bind to multiple, structurally diverse strains, has provided renewed interest in this area. This review will focus on new technologies that enable the discovery of bNAbs, the challenges and opportunities of immunotherapies as an important addition to existing antiviral therapy, and the role of antibody discovery in informing rational vaccine discovery \u2013 with agents targeting influenza specifically addressed. Multiple candidates have entered the clinic and raise the possibility that a single antibody or small combination of antibodies can effectively neutralize a wide variety of strains. However, challenges remain \u2013 including combating escape variants, pharmacodynamics of antibody distribution, and development of efficacy biomarkers beyond virologic endpoints."

Polysaccharide-based vaccines have provided a degree of success in limiting morbidity from disseminated bacterial infections, including those caused by the major human obligate pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of these polysaccharide vaccines, such as partial coverage and induced escape leading to persistence of disease, provide a compelling argument for the development of protein vaccines. In this review, we briefly chronicle approaches that have yielded licensed vaccines before highlighting reverse vaccinology 2.0 and its potential application in the discovery of novel bacterial protein vaccine candidates. Technical challenges and research gaps are also discussed."

A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize mice.

Webbased epitope databases, vaccine design resources, and protein structure comparison resources can help to improve our understanding of immune responses and the escape and evolution of pathogens. (Korber et al., 2006) As an example, there have been massive antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. (Sievers et al., 2015)...The workflow of vaccine design using reverse vaccinology is shown. First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans.",

Recent findingsRecent studies have uncovered a wealth of information about the relationship between the sequences and efficacies of anti-HIV-1 antibodies through a combination of bioinformatics, structural characterization and in vivo studies. This knowledge has stimulated efforts to enhance antibody breadth and potency for therapeutic use. Although some engineered antibodies have shown increased polyreactivity and short half-lives, promising efforts are circumventing these problems. SummaryAntibodies are desirable as therapeutics due to their ability to recognize targets with both specificity and high affinity. Furthermore, the ability of antibodies to stimulate Fc-mediated effector functions can increase their utility. Thus, mAbs have become central to strategies for the treatment of various diseases. Using both targeted and library-based approaches, antibodies can be engineered to improve their therapeutic properties. This article will discuss recent antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. The polyreactivity of engineered HIV-1 bNAbs and the effect on serum half-life will be explored along with strategies to overcome problems introduced by engineering antibodies. Finally, advances in creating bispecific anti-HIV-1 reagents are discussed."

First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans."

By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines.

Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are known to induce protective antibodies; however, it is not feasible to develop CPS-based vaccines that cover all of the 90 disease-causing serotypes. We applied a genomic approach and described the antibody repertoire for pneumococcal proteins using display libraries expressing 15\u2013150 amino acid fragments of the pathogen's proteome. Serum antibodies of exposed, but not infected, individuals and convalescing patients identified the ANTIGENome of pneumococcus consisting of \u223c140 antigens, many of them surface exposed. Based on several in vitro assays, 18 novel candidates were preselected for animal studies, and 4 of them showed significant protection against lethal sepsis. Two lead vaccine candidates, protein required for cell wall separation of group B streptococcus (PcsB) and serine/threonine protein kinase (StkP), were found to be exceptionally conserved among clinical isolates (>99.5% identity) and cross-protective against four different serotypes in lethal sepsis and pneumonia models, and have important nonredundant functions in bacterial multiplication based on gene deletion studies. We describe for the first time opsonophagocytic killing activity for pneumococcal protein antigens.

A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize mice.

The vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide induced bactericidal antibodies in mice against 78% of a panel of 85 meningococcal strains representative of the global population diversity.

Previously, vaccines were typically made of rather crude mixtures of inactivated or attenuated causative agents. However, over the last 10\u201320 years, several important technological and computational advances have enabled major progress in the discovery and design of potently immunogenic recombinant protein vaccine antigens. Here we discuss three key breakthrough approaches that have potentiated structural and computational vaccine design. Firstly, genomic sciences gave birth to the field of reverse vaccinology, which has enabled the rapid computational identification of potential vaccine antigens. Secondly, major advances in structural biology, experimental epitope mapping, and computational epitope prediction have yielded molecular insights into the immunogenic determinants defining protective antigens, enabling their rational optimization. Thirdly, and most recently, computational approaches have been used to convert this wealth of structural and immunological information into the design of improved vaccine antigens. This review aims to illustrate the growing power of combining sequencing, structural and computational approaches, and we discuss how this may drive the design of novel immunogens suitable for future vaccines urgently needed to increase the global prevention of infectious disease.",

We discuss several examples of the crystallographic characterization of vaccine antigen structures, alone or in complexes with ligands or receptors. We cover the critical role of high-resolution epitope mapping by reviewing structures of complexes between antigens and their cognate neutralizing, or protective, antibody fragments. Most importantly, we provide recent examples where structural insights obtained via protein crystallography have been used to design novel optimized vaccine antigens.

The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (Schieffelin et al., 2010)(Wrammert et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2010).

However, prior infection or circulating maternal antibodies can also mediate a non-protective antibody response that can enhance the course of disease in a subsequent heterotypic infection. Naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies can help us understand the protective and pathogenic roles of the humoral immune system in dengue virus infection.ResultsEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of a human subject with previous dengue infection was performed. B cell cultures were screened by ELISA for antibodies to dengue (DENV) envelope (E) protein. ELISA positive cultures were cloned by limiting dilution. Three IgG1 human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) were purified and their binding specificity to E protein was verified by ELISA and biolayer interferometry. Neutralization and enhancement assays were conducted in epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines, respectively. All three HMAbs bound to E from at least two of the four DENV serotypes, one of the HMAbs was neutralizing, and all were able to enhance DENV infection.ConclusionsHMAbs against DENV can be successfully generated by EBV transformation of B cells from patients at least two years after naturally acquired DENV infections. These antibodies show different patterns of cross-reactivity, neutralizing, and enhancement activity."

A limitation of current serogroup B vaccines is the breadth of coverage afforded, resulting from the capacity for extensive variation of the meningococcus and its huge potential for the generation of further diversity. Thus, the continuous search for candidate antigens that will compose supplementary or replacement vaccines is mandated. Here, we describe successful efforts to utilize the reverse vaccinology 2.0 approach to identify novel functional meningococcal antigens. In this study, eight broadly cross-reactive sequence-specific antimeningococcal human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were cloned from 4\u2009ml of blood taken from a 7-month-old sufferer of IMD. Three of these hmAbs possessed human complement-dependent bactericidal activity against meningococcal serogroup B strains of disparate PorA and 4CMenB antigen sequence types, strongly suggesting that the target(s) of these bactericidal hmAbs are not PorA (the immunodominant meningococcal antigen), factor-H binding protein, or other components of current meningococcal vaccines. Reactivity of the bactericidal hmAbs was confirmed to a single ca. 35\u2009kDa protein in western blots. Unequivocal identification of this antigen is currently ongoing.

Stronger serum reactivity to surface proteins and peptides from B. burgdorferi was also associated with faster resolution of clinical symptoms. Through molecular identifier-enabled antibody heavy-chain sequencing of bulk B cells and single-cell paired-chain antibody sequencing of blood plasmablasts, we characterized immunoglobulin gene usage patterns specific to B. burgdorferi infection. Recombinantly expressed antibodies from expanded lineages bound B. burgdorferi antigens, confirming that these clones are driven by the infection. Furthermore, recombinant sequence-derived antibodies were functional, inhibiting growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro. Elevations and clonal expansion of blood plasmablasts were associated with rapid return to health, while poor plasmablast responses were associated with a longer duration of symptoms following treatment. Plasmablasts induced by B. burgdorferi infection showed preferential antibody gene segment usage, while bulk sequencing of total B cells revealed convergent CDR3 motifs specific to B. burgdorferi-infected patients.

Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach."

The work of Louis Pasteur on chicken cholera opened the way to vaccine development in the laboratory. In April 1880, Pasteur reported to the French Academy of Science that \u201c\u2026chicken cholera is produced by a microscopic parasite [now known as Pasteurella multocida], that there exists an attenuated virus [Pasteur was using \u201cvirus\u201d in the ancient sense of the word] of that disease, and that one or more inoculations of this attenuated virus can preserve the animals from the mortal effects of a later inoculation \u2026 let me be permitted to use the word \u2018vaccinate\u2019 to express the act of inoculating a chicken with the attenuated virus\u201d [1]. Thus, the word \u201cvaccinate\u201d was extended beyond vaccinia and came to have its modern meaning. Today, epidemic infectious diseases of children for which there are vaccines have virtually disappeared from industrialized countries such as the United States. These are remarkable successes, which together with clean water and antibiotics have profoundly affected human society [2]. In addition, a new field of microbiology and immunology has evolved, called \u201cvaccinology,\u201d that comprises not only vaccine development but also the use of vaccines and their effects on public health [3]. Here, I will briefly cover some aspects of the past, discuss 5 current issues in vaccinology, and then turn to the future."

This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies.

In the last decade, large-scale genomics-based technologies have emerged. Among them, the Reverse Vaccinology approach was successfully applied to the development of an innovative vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, now available on the market with the commercial name BEXSERO\u00ae (Novartis Vaccines). The limiting step of such approaches is the number of antigens to be tested in in vivo models. Several laboratories have been trying to refine the original approach in order to get to the identification of the relevant antigens straight from the genome. Here we report a new bioinformatics tool that moves a first step in this direction. The tool has been developed by identifying structural/functional features recurring in known bacterial protective antigens, the so called \u201cProtectome space,\u201d and using such \u201cprotective signatures\u201d for protective antigen discovery. In particular, we applied this new approach to Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus and we show that not only already known protective antigens were re-discovered, but also two new protective antigens were identified."

This approach can signifi cantly reduce the time necessary for the identifi cation of antigens for development of candidate vaccine and enables systematic identifi cation of all potential antigens even from pathogens which are diffi cult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined."

Recombinant DNA technology can be applied to antigen identification and isolation, and by being able to clone and express all the antigens of an organism individually, overcomes two major hurdles associated with traditional vaccines. First, before the recombinant DNA era, it was difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of particular antigens in a pure enough form to allow the appropriate testing. Recombinant DNA technology overcame this problem, and second, recombinant DNA technology has made the study of pathogenic organisms safer because single genes and their translation products are examined rather than the whole organism (Abdulhaqq et al., 2008)(Kutzler et al., 2008)(Pietersz et al., 2006)."

                            "The development of safe and effective gene delivery methods is a major challenge to enable gene therapy or DNA vaccines to become a reality. Currently there are two major approaches for delivery of genetic material, viral and non-viral. The majority of on-going clinical trials in gene therapy or DNA vaccines use retroviruses and adenoviruses for delivering genetic materials. Viral delivery systems are far more effective than non-viral delivery however there are concerns regarding toxicity, immunogenicity and possible integration of viral genetic material into the human genome. Given the negative charge of the phosphate backbone of DNA, polycationic molecules have been the major focus as carriers of DNA. There are several physiological barriers to overcome for effective systemic delivery of DNA. The ideal vector must be stable in the systemic circulation, escape the reticuloendothelial system, able to extravasate tissues, enter the target cell, escape lysosomal degradation and transport DNA to the nucleus to be transcribed. With increasing understanding of the physicochemical properties essential to overcome the various barriers, it is possible to apply rational design to the cationic carriers. A number of poly-amino acids, cationic block co-polymers, dendrimers and cyclodextrins have been rationally designed to optimize gene delivery. This review will discuss approaches that have been used to design various synthetic polycations with enhanced DNA condensing ability, serum stability and endosomolytic capability for efficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo."

Availability of sequence data from different specimens of the same species of a pathogen provides an opportunity to select novel vaccine candidates. Thus the empiric approach to vaccine development is being replaced by vaccine design. The RV approach is one of the most powerful examples of biotechnology applied to the field of vaccinology for identifying new protein-based vaccines.\n\nRV combines the availability of genomic data, the analyzing capabilities of new bioinformatic tools and the application of high throughput expression. Purification systems can be combined with serological screening assays for a coordinated screening process of the entire genomic repertoire of bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens. The application of RV to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B represents the first success of this novel approach. This approach can be easily applied to any pathogen [34]."

                            "Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach."

The work of Louis Pasteur on chicken cholera opened the way to vaccine development in the laboratory. In April 1880, Pasteur reported to the French Academy of Science that \"\u2026chicken cholera is produced by a microscopic parasite [now known as Pasteurella multocida], that there exists an attenuated virus [Pasteur was using \"virus\" in the ancient sense of the word] of that disease, and that one or more inoculations of this attenuated virus can preserve the animals from the mortal effects of a later inoculation \u2026 let me be permitted to use the word \u2018vaccinate\u2019 to express the act of inoculating a chicken with the attenuated virus\" [1]. Thus, the word \"vaccinate\" was extended beyond vaccinia and came to have its modern meaning. Today, epidemic infectious diseases of children for which there are vaccines have virtually disappeared from industrialized countries such as the United States. These are remarkable successes, which together with clean water and antibiotics have profoundly affected human society [2]. In addition, a new field of microbiology and immunology has evolved, called \"vaccinology,\" that comprises not only vaccine development but also the use of vaccines and their effects on public health [3]. Here, I will briefly cover some aspects of the past, discuss 5 current issues in vaccinology, and then turn to the future."

Sequence variation of surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity of the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide with human tissues have hampered efforts to develop a successful vaccine. To overcome these obstacles, the entire genome sequence of a virulent serogroup B strain (MC58) was used to identify vaccine candidates. A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. The sera allowed the identification of proteins that are surface exposed, that are conserved in sequence across a range of strains, and that induce a bactericidal antibody response, a property known to correlate with vaccine efficacy in humans."

                            "New generation vaccines are in demand to include only the key antigens sufficient to confer protective immunity among the plethora of pathogen molecules. In the last decade, large-scale genomics-based technologies have emerged. Among them, the Reverse Vaccinology approach was successfully applied to the development of an innovative vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, now available on the market with the commercial name BEXSERO\u00ae (Novartis Vaccines). The limiting step of such approaches is the number of antigens to be tested in in vivo models. Several laboratories have been trying to refine the original approach in order to get to the identification of the relevant antigens straight from the genome. Here we report a new bioinformatics tool that moves a first step in this direction. The tool has been developed by identifying structural/functional features recurring in known bacterial protective antigens, the so called \"Protectome space,\" and using such \"protective signatures\" for protective antigen discovery. In particular, we applied this new approach to Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus and we show that not only already known protective antigens were re-discovered, but also two new protective antigens were identified."

                            "The need to find highly conserved antigens for a universal meningococcal B vaccine has led to a pioneering approach called reverse vaccinology that takes advantage of the availability of the complete genome sequences of N. meningitidis to help define novel antigens as vaccine candidates (in silico analysis to define conserved surface-located meningococcal proteins). Subsequently, these vaccine candidates can be confirmed (or not) experimentally through cloning, expression of the corresponding genes, and immunization with purified proteins. Indeed, genomic analysis allowed the identification of a \"cocktail\" of several proteins that can be used for a universal vaccine against N. meningitis and in particular those belonging to serogroup B. Using this approach, the Chiron Company (now Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) exploited the data of the complete genome of serogroup B MC58 meningococcal strain generated by Tettelin et al to identify several proteins as vaccine candidates. They were used to develop a new recombinant vaccine that can target meningococcal isolates of serogroup B."

                            "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are the most common infectious agents of humans. No safe and effective HSV vaccines have been licensed. Reverse vaccinology is an emerging and revolutionary vaccine development strategy that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by informatics analysis of genome sequences. Vaxign (http://www.violinet.org/vaxign) is the first web-based vaccine design program based on reverse vaccinology. In this study, we used Vaxign to analyze 52 herpesvirus genomes, including 3 HSV-1 genomes, one HSV-2 genome, 8 other human herpesvirus genomes, and 40 non-human herpesvirus genomes. The HSV-1 strain 17 genome that contains 77 proteins was used as the seed genome. These 77 proteins are conserved in two other HSV-1 strains (strain F and strain H129). Two envelope glycoproteins gJ and gG do not have orthologs in HSV-2 or 8 other human herpesviruses. Seven HSV-1 proteins (including gJ and gG) do not have orthologs in all 40 non-human herpesviruses. Nineteen proteins are conserved in all human herpesviruses, including capsid scaffold protein UL26.5 (NP_044628.1). As the only HSV-1 protein predicted to be an adhesin, UL26.5 is a promising vaccine target. The MHC Class I and II epitopes were predicted by the Vaxign Vaxitop prediction program and IEDB prediction programs recently installed and incorporated in Vaxign. Our comparative analysis found that the two programs identified largely the same top epitopes but also some positive results predicted from one program might not be positive from another program. Overall, our Vaxign computational prediction provides many promising candidates for rational HSV vaccine development. The method is generic and can also be used to predict other viral vaccine targets."

BLASTn was done to identify the most conserved antigens. PSORTb 3.0.2 was run to predict the subcellular localization of the proteins. B cell epitope prediction was done for the immunogenicity testing. Finally, BLASTp was done for verifying the extent of similarity to human proteome to exclude the possibility of autoimmunity. Proteins failing to comply with the set parameters were filtered at each step. Based on the above criteria, out of the initial 22 pneumococcal proteins selected for screening, pavB and pullulanase were the most promising candidate proteins."

                "text": "\nReverse Vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0) builds upon the genome-based approach of conventional reverse vaccinology by incorporating a more targeted, antibody-driven methodology for antigen discovery and vaccine design. Unlike its predecessor, which primarily identifies potential antigens through genomic analysis, RV 2.0 begins with the isolation of human antibodies that demonstrate functional activity against a pathogen <Paper corpusId=\"149711593\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe core principle of RV 2.0 is to harness the natural human immune response to infection or vaccination as a guide for identifying the most relevant antigenic targets <Paper corpusId=\"219181593\" paperTitle=\"(Rosini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This process involves several distinct steps: first, isolating antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from infected, vaccinated, or convalescent individuals; second, cloning and expressing the variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain genes as recombinant monoclonal antibodies; third, characterizing these antibodies for desired functionality such as neutralization or bactericidal activity; and finally, using structural and functional analyses to identify and optimize protective epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"226987684\" paperTitle=\"(Vrancianu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"49743660\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al._1, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key technological advancement enabling RV 2.0 has been the development of high-throughput methods for screening and analyzing human B cell repertoires. Modern techniques allow researchers to isolate and sequence antibody genes from single B cells, then express these as recombinant proteins that maintain their natural pairing and functionality <Paper corpusId=\"231809363\" paperTitle=\"(Dussupt et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"28880618\" paperTitle=\"(Georgiou et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technological framework creates what has been described as a \"multi-faceted, seamless pipeline\" that connects human immunology with structural and computational biology to drive rational vaccine design <Paper corpusId=\"231809363\" paperTitle=\"(Dussupt et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10823671\" paperTitle=\"(Rappuoli et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe workflow of RV 2.0 typically follows a systematic sequence: isolation of B cells from suitable donors, PCR amplification and sequencing of antibody gene segments, recombinant expression of antibodies, functional screening, structural characterization of antibody-antigen complexes, and finally, structure-based design of optimized immunogens <Paper corpusId=\"31604128\" paperTitle=\"(Oh et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach is particularly powerful because it not only identifies protective antigens but also precisely defines the specific epitopes that are targeted by functional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"249887109\" paperTitle=\"(Pantaleo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA distinctive feature of RV 2.0 is its emphasis on structural biology. By resolving three-dimensional structures of antigen-antibody complexes, researchers can gain detailed insights into the molecular interactions that confer protection, allowing for the rational design of antigens that better present protective epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"219181593\" paperTitle=\"(Rosini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244464897\" paperTitle=\"(Derking et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Studies have successfully applied this approach to identify functional antibodies against bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Borrelia burgdorferi <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"49743660\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al._1, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51678344\" paperTitle=\"(Blum et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, researchers have isolated bactericidal human monoclonal antibodies from meningococcal disease patients that target novel antigens distinct from those in current vaccines, highlighting the potential of RV 2.0 to uncover previously overlooked vaccine candidates <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn additional advantage of RV 2.0 is that the isolated monoclonal antibodies themselves can serve as therapeutic agents for passive immunization, providing dual benefits for both vaccine design and immediate intervention against infections <Paper corpusId=\"249887109\" paperTitle=\"(Pantaleo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"270960028\" paperTitle=\"(Joubbi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual utility makes RV 2.0 particularly valuable for responding to emerging infectious diseases, where rapid development of both preventative and therapeutic countermeasures is critical <Paper corpusId=\"231809363\" paperTitle=\"(Dussupt et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3228091\" paperTitle=\"(Walker et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe continuous refinement of high-throughput technologies for antibody isolation, sequencing, and characterization is further enhancing the power of RV 2.0. Modern approaches can now uncover conformational and broadly cross-reactive epitopes that may serve as the basis for more effective vaccine antigens <Paper corpusId=\"265513914\" paperTitle=\"(Baqar et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

By single B cells sorting and culturing, antibodies (Ab) with the desired functionality are selected and the corresponding Ig gene sequenced, and Abs produced as recombinant proteins. Three-dimensional structure resolution of the Ag-Ab (Fab) complex leads to a detailed definition of the protective epitope. Structural information and identification of the protective epitopes can drive the design of a novel optimized immunogens (\"structure-based Ag design\"). The new Ag can then be included in the best formulation or delivery system and tested in humans. The Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach has allowed the identification of the cytomegalovirus CMV pentameric complex (94) and of the pre-fusion of F protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (McLellan et al., 2013). Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens."

Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity. Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens. Growing knowledge in this field could lead to the rational design of new antigens more stable and elicit a high level of functional antibodies."

                            "Preclinical vaccine development methods are enriched by detailed analysis of the human immune response to etiological agents of infectious diseases. For example, with the development of high-throughput technologies, deep sequencing of the gene segments encoding the variable regions of antibody heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chains in a given B cell repertoire is providing valuable information useful in understanding adaptive immunity to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies (Dekosky et al., 2013)(Georgiou et al., 2014). Identifying the targets of antibodies of interest by cloning and in vitro expression of VH and VL chains of B-cell antibodies is a powerful approach, which can be utilized to inform on the functional immunogenicity of both known and novel antigens. The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (Schieffelin et al., 2010)(Wrammert et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2010). The power of the approach lies in the expression of paired VH and VL regions from individual plasmablasts or memory B cells; the output being the expression of hmAbs mimicking natural VH + VL combinations induced in the host."

In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (Georgiou et al., 2014)(Rappuoli et al., 2016)."

(Rappuoli, 2000)(Rappuoli et al., 2011) Fig. 3 demonstrates the identification of novel and the most effective epitopes using NGS and high-throughput robotic crystallization platforms to enable more precise prediction of epitope targets for efficient antibody generation. Webbased epitope databases, vaccine design resources, and protein structure comparison resources can help to improve our understanding of immune responses and the escape and evolution of pathogens. (Korber et al., 2006) As an example, there have been massive antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. (Sievers et al., 2015)",
                            "The workflow of vaccine design using reverse vaccinology is shown. First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans."

                            "For most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nExperimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats."

Here, we show that blood plasmablasts and CD27\u2212 memory B cells are elevated in untreated Lyme disease, with higher plasmablast levels associated with more rapid resolution of clinical symptoms. Stronger serum reactivity to surface proteins and peptides from B. burgdorferi was also associated with faster resolution of clinical symptoms. Through molecular identifier-enabled antibody heavy-chain sequencing of bulk B cells and single-cell paired-chain antibody sequencing of blood plasmablasts, we characterized immunoglobulin gene usage patterns specific to B. burgdorferi infection. Recombinantly expressed antibodies from expanded lineages bound B. burgdorferi antigens, confirming that these clones are driven by the infection. Furthermore, recombinant sequence-derived antibodies were functional, inhibiting growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro. Elevations and clonal expansion of blood plasmablasts were associated with rapid return to health, while poor plasmablast responses were associated with a longer duration of symptoms following treatment. Plasmablasts induced by B. burgdorferi infection showed preferential antibody gene segment usage, while bulk sequencing of total B cells revealed convergent CDR3 motifs specific to B. burgdorferi-infected patients. Our results show that robust plasmablast responses encoding Bb-static antibodies are associated with more rapid resolution of Lyme disease, and these antibodies could provide the basis for next-generation therapeutics for Lyme disease."

                            "Antibodies have been used for more than 100 years in the therapy of infectious diseases, but a new generation of highly potent and/or broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (sometimes referred to as 'super-antibodies') offers new opportunities for intervention. The isolation of these antibodies, most of which are rarely induced in human infections, has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single B cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation. Engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases. Super-antibodies offer promise for the prophylaxis and therapy of infections with a range of viruses, including those that are highly antigenically variable and those that are newly emerging or that have pandemic potential. The next few years will be decisive in the realization of the promise of super-antibodies."

When coupled with high-resolution epitope mapping methodologies and in vitro functional assays, he explained how the characterization of large panels of huMAbs can uncover conformational and broadly cross-reactive epitopes that may serve as basis of vaccine antigens."

A fundamental advancement has been the greatly enhanced ability to clone human B cells and produce corresponding recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), creating an extensive collection of reagents for evaluating protective immune responses <Paper corpusId=\"10823671\" paperTitle=\"(Rappuoli et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technological progress includes improved methods for identifying optimal donors through comprehensive assessment of serum-functional antibody responses, significantly increasing the likelihood of isolating highly potent antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"10823671\" paperTitle=\"(Rappuoli et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of more efficient Epstein-Barr virus transformation protocols for human B cells has been particularly instrumental in this field. These methods allow researchers to rapidly interrogate the memory repertoire of recovered patients and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that were naturally selected during infection <Paper corpusId=\"44112539\" paperTitle=\"(Tagliabue et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"32435179\" paperTitle=\"(Traggiai et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach was successfully demonstrated during the SARS-CoV outbreak, where researchers isolated antibodies with impressive neutralizing activities and protective potential in animal models <Paper corpusId=\"32435179\" paperTitle=\"(Traggiai et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHigh-throughput screening platforms have emerged as critical tools for antibody discovery, especially for identifying broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against highly variable pathogens. These assays, combined with detailed structure-function analyses, have successfully uncovered bNAbs targeting conserved epitopes in viruses such as influenza, HIV, and dengue <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7627323\" paperTitle=\"(Shriver et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ability to identify antibodies that recognize structurally conserved epitopes across diverse strains has significant implications for developing vaccines with broader protection.\n\nStructural biology approaches have become increasingly important in antibody technology, enabling three-dimensional studies of target antigens complexed with antibody fragments <Paper corpusId=\"44112539\" paperTitle=\"(Tagliabue et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These structural insights reveal protective epitopes capable of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"44112539\" paperTitle=\"(Tagliabue et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1880833\" paperTitle=\"(Liljeroos et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17420754\" paperTitle=\"(Malito et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. High-resolution epitope mapping through crystallographic characterization of antigen-antibody complexes has become an essential component of rational vaccine design, allowing researchers to precisely understand the molecular interactions that confer protection <Paper corpusId=\"17420754\" paperTitle=\"(Malito et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of computational approaches with these structural insights has further revolutionized antibody technology, enabling the design of novel immunogens. For example, researchers have successfully used structural information from bNAb-antigen complexes to graft both linear and discontinuous epitopes onto computationally designed scaffolds, creating optimized antigens <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of antibody repertoires induced by these designer antigens facilitates the identification of improved bNAbs and antigens in an iterative process <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese converging technological advances\u2014improved B cell manipulation, high-throughput screening, structural biology, and computational design\u2014have created a powerful platform for systematic antibody discovery and antigen optimization. Together, they have transformed the field of recombinant antibody technology from a primarily descriptive science to a design-driven discipline capable of developing novel immunogens with enhanced protective potential <Paper corpusId=\"44112539\" paperTitle=\"(Tagliabue et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1880833\" paperTitle=\"(Liljeroos et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

We have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells. We used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins, including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10\u22128M to 10\u221211M. One such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection.

                            "Passive immunization using antibodies is a promising alternative to other antiviral treatment options. The potential for seasonal protection arising from a single injection of antibodies is appealing and has been pursued for a number of infectious agents. However, until recently, antibody-based strategies to combat infectious agents have been hampered due to the fact that most antibodies have been found to be strain specific, with the virus evolving resistance in many cases. The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in influenza, dengue virus, and HIV, which bind to multiple, structurally diverse strains, has provided renewed interest in this area. This review will focus on new technologies that enable the discovery of bNAbs, the challenges and opportunities of immunotherapies as an important addition to existing antiviral therapy, and the role of antibody discovery in informing rational vaccine discovery \u2013 with agents targeting influenza specifically addressed. Multiple candidates have entered the clinic and raise the possibility that a single antibody or small combination of antibodies can effectively neutralize a wide variety of strains. However, challenges remain \u2013 including combating escape variants, pharmacodynamics of antibody distribution, and development of efficacy biomarkers beyond virologic endpoints."

However, it is less well-known that structural biology has emerged as a major tool for the design of novel vaccine antigens. Here, we review the important contributions that protein crystallography has made so far to vaccine research and development. We discuss several examples of the crystallographic characterization of vaccine antigen structures, alone or in complexes with ligands or receptors. We cover the critical role of high-resolution epitope mapping by reviewing structures of complexes between antigens and their cognate neutralizing, or protective, antibody fragments. Most importantly, we provide recent examples where structural insights obtained via protein crystallography have been used to design novel optimized vaccine antigens. This review aims to illustrate the value of protein crystallography in the emerging discipline of structural vaccinology and its impact on the rational design of vaccines."

Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined."

First, before the recombinant DNA era, it was difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of particular antigens in a pure enough form to allow the appropriate testing. Recombinant DNA technology overcame this problem, and second, recombinant DNA technology has made the study of pathogenic organisms safer because single genes and their translation products are examined rather than the whole organism (Abdulhaqq et al., 2008)(Kutzler et al., 2008)(Pietersz et al., 2006)."

This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential.

                            "For most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nExperimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats."

                            "Availability of complete genome sequences, high throughput technologies and synthetic biology has enabled reverse vaccinology (RV). Availability of sequence data from different specimens of the same species of a pathogen provides an opportunity to select novel vaccine candidates. Thus the empiric approach to vaccine development is being replaced by vaccine design. The RV approach is one of the most powerful examples of biotechnology applied to the field of vaccinology for identifying new protein-based vaccines.\n\nRV combines the availability of genomic data, the analyzing capabilities of new bioinformatic tools and the application of high throughput expression. Purification systems can be combined with serological screening assays for a coordinated screening process of the entire genomic repertoire of bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens. The application of RV to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B represents the first success of this novel approach. This approach can be easily applied to any pathogen [34]."

This breakthrough addressed a pathogen for which traditional vaccine approaches had failed due to the cross-reactivity of its capsular polysaccharide with human tissues. Researchers systematically mined the genome of a virulent serogroup B strain (MC58) to identify surface-expressed proteins based on the presence of signal peptides, subsequently evaluating these candidates for immunogenicity in mice. <Paper corpusId=\"233388611\" paperTitle=\"(Schijns et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"43349049\" paperTitle=\"(Pizza et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper> This pioneering work has significantly reduced the impact of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. <Paper corpusId=\"233388611\" paperTitle=\"(Schijns et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe success of Bexsero\u00ae established a blueprint for applying reverse vaccinology to other challenging pathogens. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, genomic approaches identified several protective antigens, with protein required for cell wall separation of group B streptococcus (PcsB) and serine/threonine protein kinase (StkP) emerging as particularly promising candidates. These proteins showed exceptional conservation among clinical isolates (>99.5% identity) and demonstrated cross-protection against four different serotypes in lethal sepsis and pneumonia models. <Paper corpusId=\"40262389\" paperTitle=\"(Dormitzer et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16023604\" paperTitle=\"(Giefing et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe more recently developed Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach has expanded the toolkit for vaccine development, particularly for viral pathogens. This methodology has enabled the identification of critical antigenic structures such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) pentameric complex and the pre-fusion F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). <Paper corpusId=\"219181593\" paperTitle=\"(Rosini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> These discoveries represent significant advances in understanding the protective epitopes for these viruses and have informed the design of optimized immunogens.\n\nWhile initially proven for viral targets, Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 is now being successfully applied to bacterial pathogens. In a notable example, researchers employed this approach to isolate functional antibodies from Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients. Of ten monoclonal antibodies produced, four enhanced opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus, with one targeting a previously unidentified novel antigen. <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSimilar success has been demonstrated with meningococcal disease, where researchers cloned eight broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies from just 4 ml of blood from an infant with invasive meningococcal disease. Three of these antibodies exhibited complement-dependent bactericidal activity against meningococcal strains with diverse antigen profiles, suggesting they target conserved epitopes distinct from components in current vaccines. <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"49743660\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al._1, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe approach has also proven valuable for Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi infection), where researchers identified antibody-producing cells from infected patients and characterized immunoglobulin gene usage patterns specific to B. burgdorferi infection. Recombinantly expressed antibodies from expanded lineages not only bound B. burgdorferi antigens but also demonstrated functional activity by inhibiting bacterial growth in vitro. <Paper corpusId=\"52933407\" paperTitle=\"(Bidmos et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51678344\" paperTitle=\"(Blum et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond these examples, reverse vaccinology methods have been applied to develop vaccines against a variety of other pathogens, including Leishmania infantum and additional Streptococcus species. <Paper corpusId=\"45980499\" paperTitle=\"(Cordeiro et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> The genomic approach has been particularly valuable for pathogens where traditional methods have failed to yield effective vaccines, demonstrating the power of recombinant antibody technology to overcome historical limitations in vaccine development.",

                            "For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity (Rappuoli, 2000). Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus (Giefing et al., 2008) and group B streptococcus (Maione et al., 2005). Reverse vaccinology vaccine candidates for Staphylococcus aureus (Weichhart et al., 2003) and meningococcus B (Giuliani et al., 2006)(Pizza et al., 2000) are now in clinical trials."

                            "Pneumococcus is one of the most important human pathogens that causes life-threatening invasive diseases, especially at the extremities of age. Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are known to induce protective antibodies; however, it is not feasible to develop CPS-based vaccines that cover all of the 90 disease-causing serotypes. We applied a genomic approach and described the antibody repertoire for pneumococcal proteins using display libraries expressing 15\u2013150 amino acid fragments of the pathogen's proteome. Serum antibodies of exposed, but not infected, individuals and convalescing patients identified the ANTIGENome of pneumococcus consisting of \u223c140 antigens, many of them surface exposed. Based on several in vitro assays, 18 novel candidates were preselected for animal studies, and 4 of them showed significant protection against lethal sepsis. Two lead vaccine candidates, protein required for cell wall separation of group B streptococcus (PcsB) and serine/threonine protein kinase (StkP), were found to be exceptionally conserved among clinical isolates (>99.5% identity) and cross-protective against four different serotypes in lethal sepsis and pneumonia models, and have important nonredundant functions in bacterial multiplication based on gene deletion studies. We describe for the first time opsonophagocytic killing activity for pneumococcal protein antigens. A vaccine containing PcsB and StkP is intended for the prevention of infections caused by all serotypes of pneumococcus in the elderly and in children."

By single B cells sorting and culturing, antibodies (Ab) with the desired functionality are selected and the corresponding Ig gene sequenced, and Abs produced as recombinant proteins. Three-dimensional structure resolution of the Ag-Ab (Fab) complex leads to a detailed definition of the protective epitope. Structural information and identification of the protective epitopes can drive the design of a novel optimized immunogens (\"structure-based Ag design\"). The new Ag can then be included in the best formulation or delivery system and tested in humans. The Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach has allowed the identification of the cytomegalovirus CMV pentameric complex (94) and of the pre-fusion of F protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (McLellan et al., 2013). Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens."

Therefore, harnessing the antibody component of a potent human humoral response to disseminated infection is valuable for the identification of novel protective antigens. This approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0) (Burton, 2002)(Rappuoli et al., 2016), relies on the isolation and recombinant expression of the variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chain genes of immunoglobulin (focus has centerd on IgG) using a variety of molecular tools. Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity (26,(Amara et al., 2018)",

                            "Preclinical vaccine development methods are enriched by detailed analysis of the human immune response to etiological agents of infectious diseases. For example, with the development of high-throughput technologies, deep sequencing of the gene segments encoding the variable regions of antibody heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chains in a given B cell repertoire is providing valuable information useful in understanding adaptive immunity to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies (Dekosky et al., 2013)(Georgiou et al., 2014). Identifying the targets of antibodies of interest by cloning and in vitro expression of VH and VL chains of B-cell antibodies is a powerful approach, which can be utilized to inform on the functional immunogenicity of both known and novel antigens. The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (Schieffelin et al., 2010)(Wrammert et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2010). The power of the approach lies in the expression of paired VH and VL regions from individual plasmablasts or memory B cells; the output being the expression of hmAbs mimicking natural VH + VL combinations induced in the host."

Here, we show that blood plasmablasts and CD27\u2212 memory B cells are elevated in untreated Lyme disease, with higher plasmablast levels associated with more rapid resolution of clinical symptoms. Stronger serum reactivity to surface proteins and peptides from B. burgdorferi was also associated with faster resolution of clinical symptoms. Through molecular identifier-enabled antibody heavy-chain sequencing of bulk B cells and single-cell paired-chain antibody sequencing of blood plasmablasts, we characterized immunoglobulin gene usage patterns specific to B. burgdorferi infection. Recombinantly expressed antibodies from expanded lineages bound B. burgdorferi antigens, confirming that these clones are driven by the infection. Furthermore, recombinant sequence-derived antibodies were functional, inhibiting growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro. Elevations and clonal expansion of blood plasmablasts were associated with rapid return to health, while poor plasmablast responses were associated with a longer duration of symptoms following treatment. Plasmablasts induced by B. burgdorferi infection showed preferential antibody gene segment usage, while bulk sequencing of total B cells revealed convergent CDR3 motifs specific to B. burgdorferi-infected patients.

The monoclonal antibodies isolated during the discovery process not only inform vaccine design but can also serve as therapeutic agents in their own right. This dual utility is particularly valuable for immunocompromised patients who may not respond adequately to vaccination, or for therapeutic intervention during acute infection phases <Paper corpusId=\"249887109\" paperTitle=\"(Pantaleo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This comprehensive approach encompasses pre-screening of human donors, identification and sequencing of B cell receptors, expression of these sequences as monoclonal antibodies, and detailed structural and functional characterization of antibody epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"231809363\" paperTitle=\"(Dussupt et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "For most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nExperimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats."

In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (Georgiou et al., 2014)(Rappuoli et al., 2016)."

Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories."

Here, we review the important contributions that protein crystallography has made so far to vaccine research and development. We discuss several examples of the crystallographic characterization of vaccine antigen structures, alone or in complexes with ligands or receptors. We cover the critical role of high-resolution epitope mapping by reviewing structures of complexes between antigens and their cognate neutralizing, or protective, antibody fragments. Most importantly, we provide recent examples where structural insights obtained via protein crystallography have been used to design novel optimized vaccine antigens. This review aims to illustrate the value of protein crystallography in the emerging discipline of structural vaccinology and its impact on the rational design of vaccines."

                            "Passive serotherapy can confer immediate protection against microbial infection, but methods to rapidly generate human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are not yet available. We have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells. We used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins, including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10\u22128M to 10\u221211M. One such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. These results show that it is possible to interrogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection."
