Many biotechnological and computational methods have been developed for the construction of synthetic systems. Achievements in synthetic biology have been widely adopted in metabolic engineering, a field aimed at engineering micro-organisms to produce substances of interest. However, the engineering of metabolic systems requires dynamic redistribution of cellular resources, the creation of novel metabolic pathways, and optimal regulation of the pathways to achieve higher production titers. Thus, the design principles and tools developed in synthetic biology have been employed to create novel and flexible metabolic pathways and to optimize metabolic fluxes to increase the cells\u2019 capability to act as production factories.

In the early era of synthetic biology, various genetic circuits were constructed, including a genetic toggle switch and a repressilator, which began the rational design of man-made functional biological networks [1,2]. Recently, synthetic biologists have developed various biotechnological and computational methods and tools to manipulate the host genome and create various synthetic systems using various genetic components, such as DNA [3], RNA [4,5], and proteins [6], as well as complex synthetic circuits, such as bio-oscillators [7], toggle switches [1,8], and logic gates [9]. \n\nSynthetic systems have been widely applied to metabolic engineering for the biosynthesis of biofuels, commodity chemicals, and pharmaceutical molecules [10][11][12][13]. The integration of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering has provided a solution to the current increasing demand for sustainable and renewable resources in response to global concerns, such as fossil fuel depletion and rising healthcare expenses [14,15]. In particular, synthetic biology has provided advanced toolsets and novel systems, which significantly facilitate the development of metabolic engineering [10,16]. \n\nFor example, recently, the metabolic production of artemisinin (widely used as an antimalarial drug) and its precursor, artemisinic acid, was successfully achieved. Since the supply of artemisinic acid from the plant Artemisia annua or via chemical synthesis was insufficient to meet the needs of the market, it was recently produced from the metabolically engineered microbial hosts Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with higher productivity and an economically feasible titer and yield [13,17,18]. Micro-organisms have also been engineered to produce fuels for use as alternative and renewable sources of energy [19,20]. E. coli was metabolically engineered to produce isopropanol by introducing a synthetic metabolic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA to acetone and finally, to isopropanol. The pathway comprises enzymes originating from other bacterial species, namely, acetyl-coenzyme A [CoA] acetytransferase (C.",

Various strategies and tools that are used in synthetic biology to develop promising pathways and modules enable the establishment of intellectual foundations for cell factory construction in metabolic engineering. \n\nOne of the future goals of synthetic biology that is applicable to metabolic engineering is the artificial design of a novel micro-organism that possesses the capability to produce desired metabolites most efficiently and in large quantities like a factory. However, the prediction of whole cell physiologies from DNA sequences and thereby, the design of novel organisms from scratch is a great challenge. Even simple protein expression processes are very complex because of interruptions by other molecules. In addition, to our knowledge there are still no methods to accurately predict the kinetics of proteins (e.g., enzymes, interactions among proteins, DNAs, metabolites, etc.) solely from DNA sequences.

Na\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology has undergone dramatic advancements for over a decade, during which it has expanded our understanding on the systems of life and opened new avenues for microbial engineering. Many biotechnological and computational methods have been developed for the construction of synthetic systems. Achievements in synthetic biology have been widely adopted in metabolic engineering, a field aimed at engineering micro-organisms to produce substances of interest. However, the engineering of metabolic systems requires dynamic redistribution of cellular resources, the creation of novel metabolic pathways, and optimal regulation of the pathways to achieve higher production titers. Thus, the design principles and tools developed in synthetic biology have been employed to create novel and flexible metabolic pathways and to optimize metabolic fluxes to increase the cells\u2019 capability to act as production factories. In this review, we introduce synthetic biology tools and their applications to microbial cell factory constructions.\n## Introduction\nSynthetic biology adopts the principles of electrical engineering to rationally design and engineer biological systems. In the early era of synthetic biology, various genetic circuits were constructed, including a genetic toggle switch and a repressilator, which began the rational design of man-made functional biological networks [1,2]. Recently, synthetic biologists have developed various biotechnological and computational methods and tools to manipulate the host genome and create various synthetic systems using various genetic components, such as DNA [3], RNA [4,5], and proteins [6], as well as complex synthetic circuits, such as bio-oscillators [7], toggle switches [1,8], and logic gates [9]. \n\nSynthetic systems have been widely applied to metabolic engineering for the biosynthesis of biofuels, commodity chemicals, and pharmaceutical molecules [10][11][12][13]. The integration of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering has provided a solution to the current increasing demand for sustainable and renewable resources in response to global concerns, such as fossil fuel depletion and rising healthcare expenses [14,15]. In particular, synthetic biology has provided advanced toolsets and novel systems, which significantly facilitate the development of metabolic engineering [10,16]. \n\nFor example, recently, the metabolic production of artemisinin (widely used as an antimalarial drug) and its precursor, artemisinic acid, was successfully achieved. Since the supply of artemisinic acid from the plant Artemisia annua or via chemical synthesis was insufficient to meet the needs of the market, it was recently produced from the metabolically engineered microbial hosts Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with higher productivity and an economically feasible titer and yield [13,17,18]. Micro-organisms have also been engineered to produce fuels for use as alternative and renewable sources of energy [19,20]. E. coli was metabolically engineered to produce isopropanol by introducing a synthetic metabolic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA to acetone and finally, to isopropanol. The pathway comprises enzymes originating from other bacterial species, namely, acetyl-coenzyme A [CoA] acetytransferase (C.\n\n## Summary\nMetabolic engineering for the microbial production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals has been accelerated with the help of various genetic tools in synthetic biology. In this review, we introduced key technologies that are used in synthetic biology for metabolic pathway engineering, such as the design, construction, and optimization of metabolic processes as well as the engineering of synthetic components, which could make cellular processes predictable and robust to achieve desirable outcomes. Various strategies and tools that are used in synthetic biology to develop promising pathways and modules enable the establishment of intellectual foundations for cell factory construction in metabolic engineering. \n\nOne of the future goals of synthetic biology that is applicable to metabolic engineering is the artificial design of a novel micro-organism that possesses the capability to produce desired metabolites most efficiently and in large quantities like a factory. However, the prediction of whole cell physiologies from DNA sequences and thereby, the design of novel organisms from scratch is a great challenge. Even simple protein expression processes are very complex because of interruptions by other molecules. In addition, to our knowledge there are still no methods to accurately predict the kinetics of proteins (e.g., enzymes, interactions among proteins, DNAs, metabolites, etc.) solely from DNA sequences. Thus, synthetic biology is still at the early stages of development. To fulfil the goal, more knowledge",

With the unprecedented ability to synthesize and transfer any DNA and RNA across organisms, the scope of synthetic biology is expanding and being recreated in previously unimaginable ways. The field has matured to a level where highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms, can be constructed. In parallel, computational biology became an integral part of biological studies, with computational models aiding the unravelling of the escalating complexity and emerging properties of biological phenomena. However, there is still a vast untapped potential for the complete integration of modelling into the synthetic design process, presenting exciting opportunities for scientific advancements. Here, we first highlight the most recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities. Next, we propose that such a design can benefit from an organism-free modular modelling approach that places its emphasis on modules of organismal function towards the design of multispecies communities. We argue for a shift in perspective from single organism\u2013centred approaches to emphasizing the functional contributions of organisms within the community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, we can tailor organisms to fulfil specific functional roles within the community. This approach aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting possibilities for the design of artificial communities. Graphical Abstract",

                    "text": "Synthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

Ebenh\u00f6h, Matias D. Zurbriggen, Daniel C. Ducat, I. Axmann\n## Abstract\nAbstract Synthetic biology conceptualizes biological complexity as a network of biological parts, devices, and systems with predetermined functionalities and has had a revolutionary impact on fundamental and applied research. With the unprecedented ability to synthesize and transfer any DNA and RNA across organisms, the scope of synthetic biology is expanding and being recreated in previously unimaginable ways. The field has matured to a level where highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms, can be constructed. In parallel, computational biology became an integral part of biological studies, with computational models aiding the unravelling of the escalating complexity and emerging properties of biological phenomena. However, there is still a vast untapped potential for the complete integration of modelling into the synthetic design process, presenting exciting opportunities for scientific advancements. Here, we first highlight the most recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities. Next, we propose that such a design can benefit from an organism-free modular modelling approach that places its emphasis on modules of organismal function towards the design of multispecies communities. We argue for a shift in perspective from single organism\u2013centred approaches to emphasizing the functional contributions of organisms within the community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, we can tailor organisms to fulfil specific functional roles within the community. This approach aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting possibilities for the design of artificial communities. Graphical Abstract\n## From synthetic parts towards communities\nSynthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies. Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s 3 . These scientific breakthroughs allowed scientists to manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways and opened the door for a wave of innovation in genetic engineering, such as the invention of polymerase chain reaction in 1983 4 , which allowed researchers to amplify DNA sequences for use in genetic manipulation. Not long after, in the 1990s genomics emerged as a field that involved sequencing entire genomes and provided researchers with complete maps of genomes 5 , punctuated by the completion of the human genome project in 2003 5,6 . These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites) 7 .",

Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s 3 . These scientific breakthroughs allowed scientists to manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways and opened the door for a wave of innovation in genetic engineering, such as the invention of polymerase chain reaction in 1983 4 , which allowed researchers to amplify DNA sequences for use in genetic manipulation. Not long after, in the 1990s genomics emerged as a field that involved sequencing entire genomes and provided researchers with complete maps of genomes 5 , punctuated by the completion of the human genome project in 2003 5,6 . These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites) 7 .",

While incompatibility between microbial translation machineries and eukaryotic protein architecture presents a serious setback to heterologous protein expression, new discoveries and engineering strategies have been put forward to circumvent the problems. Today, catalogs of highly specialized microbial chassis are available for the functional expression of recombinant proteins with specific structural and biochemical demands (Table 1). Despite the efforts, the complex interplay of cellular physiology and recombinant expression pathways still renders the optimization of protein expression a highly challenging task. Recent advances in the systems-level understanding of cellular expression machineries and the wealth of transcriptomic and proteomic data together present an alternative scheme that could possibly mitigate the bottlenecks in recombinant protein expression. \n\nThe shared perspectives of systems and synthetic biology fostered an emerging idea that cells can be made simpler and more efficient by eliminating components of the genome deemed unnecessary for survival. Indeed, precisely designed genome reductions have consistently led to enhanced cellular features including genomic stability, growth rate, biomass, protein productivity, and genetic pliability (more amenable to genetic engineering) in the target microbial cells. For the most part, an increasing number of existing microbial chassis have been genome-streamlined to resolve some of the bottlenecks in heterologous protein expression and to further optimize their performance. Two opposing approaches exist for the construction of reduced genome strains: top-down genome reduction and bottom-up genome synthesis. Despite the shared goal, the two opposing approaches essentially differ with respect to their area of expertise. While the top-down genome reduction offers a pragmatic approach to further improve the functionality of existing cell factories, the current status of the bottom-up synthesis is more inclined toward understanding the fundamental aspects of the minimal genome. Although it is said that the bottom-up genome synthesis may provide new ground to synthesize non-natural proteins for medicinal use, the underlying cost and time to build one such",

                    "text": "It was reported that proteins with large molecular weight or those that harbor several membrane domains pose a far greater tendency to form insoluble aggregates and are prone to proteolysis [10]. Moreover, additional challenges include mimicking eukaryotic post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation) [11], production of harmful endotoxins (E. coli) [12], reduced cell viability resulting from unwanted by-products [13], and low protein yields [14]. To tackle these obstacles, different recombinant DNA technologies, including manipulation of gene expression control [15][16][17], directing proper bond formation and protein folding [18,19], interfering host metabolic pathways [20,21], random or directed evolutions of bacterial strains or enzymes [22], and series of other methods have been systematically employed (summarized in [23]). While these engineering strategies already provide practical solutions for the expression of various protein forms, the engineered expression systems can further be optimized to achieve a better performance. \n\nFunctional protein expression has met a dramatic shift paralleled with the advances in systems and synthetic biology; that is, data-driven understanding in systems biology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework on which to rationally design, build, and test biological entities in an increasingly sophisticated manner [24]. For instance, the following have altogether enabled characterization of the bacterial host and recombinant proteins at the systems level: a large influx of high-throughput information on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites that enabled visualization of the global landscape of transcriptional and translational processes [25,26]; availability of robust computational tools and in silico models streamlining detailed analysis and prediction of the cellular networks; and rapid advances in DNA synthesis, assembly techniques that facilitated the process to build and test the designed biological systems [27,28]. Such new schemes provide one possible way around biological uncertainties; that is, by systematically eliminating genetic redundancies, it is expected to minimize the confounding effects of unknown genetic elements and to reduce metabolic interference from native metabolic pathways while endorsing more predictable regulation of cellular functions [24]. This, in essence, would help to further improve the performance of the extant microbial cell factories.",

Choe, Dae-Hee Lee, Byung-Kwan Cho\n## Abstract\nA large proportion of the recombinant proteins manufactured today rely on microbe-based expression systems owing to their relatively simple and cost-effective production schemes. However, several issues in microbial protein expression, including formation of insoluble aggregates, low protein yield, and cell death are still highly recursive and tricky to optimize. These obstacles are usually rooted in the metabolic capacity of the expression host, limitation of cellular translational machineries, or genetic instability. To this end, several microbial strains having precisely designed genomes have been suggested as a way around the recurrent problems in recombinant protein expression. Already, a growing number of prokaryotic chassis strains have been genome-streamlined to attain superior cellular fitness, recombinant protein yield, and stability of the exogenous expression pathways. In this review, we outline challenges associated with heterologous protein expression, some examples of microbial chassis engineered for the production of recombinant proteins, and emerging tools to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins. In particular, we discuss the synthetic biology approaches to design and build and test genome-reduced microbial chassis that carry desirable characteristics for heterologous protein expression.\n## Introduction\nIt was reported that proteins with large molecular weight or those that harbor several membrane domains pose a far greater tendency to form insoluble aggregates and are prone to proteolysis [10]. Moreover, additional challenges include mimicking eukaryotic post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation) [11], production of harmful endotoxins (E. coli) [12], reduced cell viability resulting from unwanted by-products [13], and low protein yields [14]. To tackle these obstacles, different recombinant DNA technologies, including manipulation of gene expression control [15][16][17], directing proper bond formation and protein folding [18,19], interfering host metabolic pathways [20,21], random or directed evolutions of bacterial strains or enzymes [22], and series of other methods have been systematically employed (summarized in [23]). While these engineering strategies already provide practical solutions for the expression of various protein forms, the engineered expression systems can further be optimized to achieve a better performance. \n\nFunctional protein expression has met a dramatic shift paralleled with the advances in systems and synthetic biology; that is, data-driven understanding in systems biology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework on which to rationally design, build, and test biological entities in an increasingly sophisticated manner [24]. For instance, the following have altogether enabled characterization of the bacterial host and recombinant proteins at the systems level: a large influx of high-throughput information on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites that enabled visualization of the global landscape of transcriptional and translational processes [25,26]; availability of robust computational tools and in silico models streamlining detailed analysis and prediction of the cellular networks; and rapid advances in DNA synthesis, assembly techniques that facilitated the process to build and test the designed biological systems [27,28]. Such new schemes provide one possible way around biological uncertainties; that is, by systematically eliminating genetic redundancies, it is expected to minimize the confounding effects of unknown genetic elements and to reduce metabolic interference from native metabolic pathways while endorsing more predictable regulation of cellular functions [24]. This, in essence, would help to further improve the performance of the extant microbial cell factories.\n\n## Conclusion and Perspectives\nMicrobial expression systems have been delivering wide varieties of high-quality recombinant proteins in a scalable and cost-effective manner. While incompatibility between microbial translation machineries and eukaryotic protein architecture presents a serious setback to heterologous protein expression, new discoveries and engineering strategies have been put forward to circumvent the problems. Today, catalogs of highly specialized microbial chassis are available for the functional expression of recombinant proteins with specific structural and biochemical demands (Table 1). Despite the efforts, the complex interplay of cellular physiology and recombinant expression pathways still renders the optimization of protein expression a highly challenging task. Recent advances in the systems-level understanding of cellular expression machineries and the wealth of transcriptomic and proteomic data together present an alternative scheme that could possibly mitigate the bottlenecks in recombinant protein expression. \n\nThe shared perspectives of systems and synthetic biology fostered an emerging idea that cells can be made simpler and more efficient by eliminating components of the genome deemed unnecessary for survival. Indeed, precisely designed genome reductions have consistently led to enhanced cellular features including genomic stability, growth rate, biomass, protein productivity, and genetic pliability (more amenable to genetic engineering) in the target microbial cells. For the most part, an increasing number of existing microbial chassis have been genome-streamlined to resolve some of the bottlenecks in heterologous protein expression and to further optimize their performance. Two opposing approaches exist for the construction of reduced genome strains: top-down genome reduction and bottom-up genome synthesis. Despite the shared goal, the two opposing approaches essentially differ with respect to their area of expertise. While the top-down genome reduction offers a pragmatic approach to further improve the functionality of existing cell factories, the current status of the bottom-up synthesis is more inclined toward understanding the fundamental aspects of the minimal genome. Although it is said that the bottom-up genome synthesis may provide new ground to synthesize non-natural proteins for medicinal use, the underlying cost and time to build one such",

The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n \nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n \nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \u201cbiology by design\u201d paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired. Surmounting the challenges en route to this ambitious objective will require answering several \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d design questions. Bottom-up questions relate to the parts and modules of the synthetic biological system as well as their characterization and assembly in isolation, whereas top-down questions focus on desirable and undesirable interactions between the synthetic system and its biological context. This general framework can be applied to problems of increasing biological sophistication, ranging from the engineering of novel polymers, metabolic networks, and cellular devices. The authors illustrate the applications of these ideas to three areas: biochemical transformations, cellular devices, and therapies as well as engineering the chemistry of life. \n \nThe third paper highlights how mathematical models can predict the dynamics of a network under different conditions. This paper by Y. Zheng and G. Sriram provides detailed insights into mathematical modeling concepts and methodologies as relevant to synthetic biology. Any model is formulated on the basis of certain assumptions regarding the system under investigation as discussed by the authors. The paper introduces the two broad types of modeling frameworks: deterministic and stochastic modeling. The importance of parameter estimation and optimization in modeling is emphasized. In addition, mathematical techniques used to analyze a model such as sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis are presented. The authors discuss the role of modeling in phenotype analysis and conclude with three in-depth case studies about mathematical modeling in the framework of synthetic biology. \n \nThe second class of articles highlights examples and applications of synthetic biology for improved biofuels and biochemicals production. M. R. Connor and S. Atsumi review progress in improving microbial production of renewable liquid fuels and the unique role of synthetic biology in advancing these efforts. The fuel challenges facing society are first highlighted. They then provide an overview of research for the production of fermentative alcohols, nonfermentative higher alcohols, isoprenoids, and fatty acids. The importance of photosynthetic organisms in biofuels research is also discussed, and the reliance on synthetic biology tools to improve productivities and titers is emphasized. \n \nNext, L. R. Jarboe et al. review the combined use of synthetic biology tools with traditional metabolic engineering strategies for designing and improving microbial production of chemicals from renewable resources. They begin with an overview of technologies and tools available for biocatalyst redesign. They next describe strain engineering examples in which existing pathways were modified for the overproduction of various chemicals (e.g., succinate and D-lactate). These examples are contrasted with strain re-design via the introduction of foreign or nonnatural genes and pathways for production of compounds such as L-alanine and xylitol. The latter scenario includes the use of enzymes which have been engineered to have unnatural activities. \n \nFinally, G. H. McArthur IV and S. S. Fong focus in their paper on the impact of synthetic biology on engineering microbial metabolism. They discuss recent progress and current challenges in applying synthetic biology to metabolic engineering. In particular, the authors separately focus on each of the four workflow steps, design, modeling, synthesis, and analysis, and distinguish between parts (individual functional units) and pathways (part-based systems) for each single level. \n \nCollectively, these papers describe the current state of synthetic biology in the context of microbial biotechnology. Current and ongoing advances in this field will certainly propel our capacity to engineer improved microorganisms in the future. In this regard, these articles all provide prospective into the future of this field. \n \n \nHal Alper \n \nPatrick Cirino \n \nElke Nevoigt \n \nGanesh Sriram",

Cirino, Elke Nevoigt, G. Sriram\n## Abstract\nRecent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype. The design, use, and importation of constructed genetic control elements, optimized genes, and functional genetic circuits can be used to modulate the function of metabolic pathways. The modularity and hierarchy of parts, devices, systems, and chassis provide a framework for studying and controlling cellular functions. Moreover, synthetic biology provides an interface where protein engineering, directed evolution, DNA synthesis, and in silico design can direct the field of metabolic engineering. Many of these advances are influencing how scientists and engineers view and perturb cellular systems. Perhaps the paramount application of these tools is in the arena of microbial biotechnology where the overarching goal is to rewire cellular systems for biochemical production. This task is quite complex given the complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism and regulation. Synthetic biology approaches provide a way to both intervene in as well as bypass cellular complexities. \n \nThis special issue contains six review articles that highlight two major aspects of synthetic biology: (1) general design principles and modeling of synthetic biology and (2) applications of synthetic biology to biochemical and biofuels production. The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n \nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n \nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \u201cbiology by design\u201d paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired. Surmounting the challenges en route to this ambitious objective will require answering several \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d design questions. Bottom-up questions relate to the parts and modules of the synthetic biological system as well as their characterization and assembly in isolation, whereas top-down questions focus on desirable and undesirable interactions between the synthetic system and its biological context. This general framework can be applied to problems of increasing biological sophistication, ranging from the engineering of novel polymers, metabolic networks, and cellular devices. The authors illustrate the applications of these ideas to three areas: biochemical transformations, cellular devices, and therapies as well as engineering the chemistry of life. \n \nThe third paper highlights how mathematical models can predict the dynamics of a network under different conditions. This paper by Y. Zheng and G. Sriram provides detailed insights into mathematical modeling concepts and methodologies as relevant to synthetic biology. Any model is formulated on the basis of certain assumptions regarding the system under investigation as discussed by the authors. The paper introduces the two broad types of modeling frameworks: deterministic and stochastic modeling. The importance of parameter estimation and optimization in modeling is emphasized. In addition, mathematical techniques used to analyze a model such as sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis are presented. The authors discuss the role of modeling in phenotype analysis and conclude with three in-depth case studies about mathematical modeling in the framework of synthetic biology. \n \nThe second class of articles highlights examples and applications of synthetic biology for improved biofuels and biochemicals production. M. R. Connor and S. Atsumi review progress in improving microbial production of renewable liquid fuels and the unique role of synthetic biology in advancing these efforts. The fuel challenges facing society are first highlighted. They then provide an overview of research for the production of fermentative alcohols, nonfermentative higher alcohols, isoprenoids, and fatty acids. The importance of photosynthetic organisms in biofuels research is also discussed, and the reliance on synthetic biology tools to improve productivities and titers is emphasized. \n \nNext, L. R. Jarboe et al. review the combined use of synthetic biology tools with traditional metabolic engineering strategies for designing and improving microbial production of chemicals from renewable resources. They begin with an overview of technologies and tools available for biocatalyst redesign. They next describe strain engineering examples in which existing pathways were modified for the overproduction of various chemicals (e.g., succinate and D-lactate). These examples are contrasted with strain re-design via the introduction of foreign or nonnatural genes and pathways for production of compounds such as L-alanine and xylitol. The latter scenario includes the use of enzymes which have been engineered to have unnatural activities. \n \nFinally, G. H. McArthur IV and S. S. Fong focus in their paper on the impact of synthetic biology on engineering microbial metabolism. They discuss recent progress and current challenges in applying synthetic biology to metabolic engineering. In particular, the authors separately focus on each of the four workflow steps, design, modeling, synthesis, and analysis, and distinguish between parts (individual functional units) and pathways (part-based systems) for each single level. \n \nCollectively, these papers describe the current state of synthetic biology in the context of microbial biotechnology. Current and ongoing advances in this field will certainly propel our capacity to engineer improved microorganisms in the future. In this regard, these articles all provide prospective into the future of this field. \n \n \nHal Alper \n \nPatrick Cirino \n \nElke Nevoigt \n \nGanesh Sriram\n## body\nRecent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype.

Thus, significant reduction in cost of DNA sequencing has provided an easy access to large amounts of data on the genetic sequences of various organisms, and decreased the price of the DNA sequence synthesis, which, analogous to Moore\u2019s law, resulted in an opportunity to create a lot of potential genes without the time \u2013 consuming and labor \u2013 intensive traditional methods of molecular biology. Development of system biology has allowed forming a deeper understanding of the functions and relationship of natural biological models, as well as of the computational models describing processes at the cell and system levels. Combination of these factors has created an op\u00adportunity for conscious changes of natural biological systems. In this review the modern approaches to oligonucleotide gene assembly synthesis are discussed, including such aspects as protocols for gene assembly, sequence verification, error cor\u00adrection and further applications of synthesized genes.\n",

PTMs, such as cyclization, methylation, and proteolysis, play crucial roles in enhancing RiPP stability and bioactivity. Advances in synthetic biology and bioinformatics have significantly advanced the field, introducing new methods for RiPP production and engineering. These methods encompass strategies for heterologous expression, genetic refactoring, and exploiting the substrate tolerance of tailoring enzymes to create novel RiPP analogs with improved or entirely new functions. Furthermore, the introduction and implementation of cutting-edge screening methods, including mRNA display, surface display, and two-hybrid systems, have expedited the identification of RiPPs with significant pharmaceutical potential.

RiPPs are synthesized on ribosomes, followed by intricate post-translational modifications (PTMs), crucial for their diverse structures and functions. PTMs, such as cyclization, methylation, and proteolysis, play crucial roles in enhancing RiPP stability and bioactivity. Advances in synthetic biology and bioinformatics have significantly advanced the field, introducing new methods for RiPP production and engineering. These methods encompass strategies for heterologous expression, genetic refactoring, and exploiting the substrate tolerance of tailoring enzymes to create novel RiPP analogs with improved or entirely new functions. Furthermore, the introduction and implementation of cutting-edge screening methods, including mRNA display, surface display, and two-hybrid systems, have expedited the identification of RiPPs with significant pharmaceutical potential. This comprehensive review not only discusses the current advancements in RiPP research but also the promising opportunities that leveraging these bioactive peptides for therapeutic applications presents, illustrating the synergy between traditional biochemistry and contemporary synthetic biology and genetic engineering approaches.\n## Advances in Synthetic Biology for RiPP Expression and Production\nSynthetic biology provides innovative solutions to overcome the challenges associated with expression, engineering, and screening.A key advancement is the development of strategies targeting multiple synthetic biology levels, including individual proteins, pathways, metabolic flux, and host optimization.This approach significantly enhances the feasibility and effectiveness of RiPP preparation by tailoring the host's metabolic machinery to support RiPP biosynthesis.Moreover, synthetic biology enables the engineering of RiPPs by reconstituting precursor peptides, wherein different functional groups are added to the core peptides.This interchangeability of substrate elements is crucial to tailoring RiPPs both in vivo and in vitro, thereby expanding the chemical and functional space of RiPPs.\n\nRiPPs are produced via two distinct approaches including (1) natural biosynthesis and (2) heterologous expression.Natural biosynthesis utilizes the organism's inherent metabolic pathways to produce RiPPs.Producing RiPPs in their native environment ensures correct folding and PTMs essential for their biological activity, as well as the natural diversity of RiPP structures and bioactivities.However, natural biosynthesis is limited by scalability, variability in yield, purity, and gene silencing [64].To address these issues, considerable research efforts have focused on heterologous expression in surrogate hosts like E. coli or Streptomyces sp.Heterologous expression allows researchers to circumvent the complexity and the limitations of native genetic systems, typically using model organisms whose genetic manipulation and scale-up are easier than source organisms.This approach, however, presents challenges such as the complexity of reconstituting native biosynthetic machinery in a heterologous host and stability issues with precursor peptides [18][19][20].Additionally, PTMs may occur differently between the host and the native producer, potentially affecting the final RiPP structure and activity.Despite these challenges, heterologous expression (Figure 3) has offered opportunities for discovery and innovation beyond the capabilities of natural biosynthesis.\n\nisms whose genetic manipulation and scale-up are easier than source organisms.",

Synthetic biology covers a broad research area, which combines the disciplines in biology and engineering. It aims to design and create new biological systems to perform functions that are not found in nature. The statement of \"synthetic biology\" was first appeared in 1980. Until recently, with the matureness of genetic tools, the rapid growth of synthetic biology in research, innovation, and policy interest has been seen [1]. The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method. The third is the creation of a completely new biological system and even artificial life after the first two fields have been well developed.

Dong, M. Jiang, F. Xin\n## Abstract\nWith the increased development in research, innovation, and policy interest in recent years, biosynthetic technology has developed rapidly, which combines engineering, electronics, computer science, mathematics, and other disciplines based on classical genetic engineering and metabolic engineering. It gives a wider perspective and a deeper level to perceive the nature of life via cell mechanism, regulatory networks, or biological evolution. Currently, synthetic biology has made great breakthrough in energy, chemical industry, and medicine industries, particularly in the programmable genetic control at multiple levels of regulation to perform designed goals. In this review, the most advanced and comprehensive developments achieved in biosynthetic technology were represented, including genetic engineering as well as synthetic genomics. In addition, the superiority together with the limitations of the current genome-editing tools were summarized.\n## Background\nSynthetic biology is based on the study of system biology, using \"problem-oriented\" and \"bottom-up\" engineering design ideas to build standardized components and modules, which rebuilds existing natural systems to obtain new biological systems or de novo synthesize new artificial biological systems. Synthetic biology covers a broad research area, which combines the disciplines in biology and engineering. It aims to design and create new biological systems to perform functions that are not found in nature. The statement of \"synthetic biology\" was first appeared in 1980. Until recently, with the matureness of genetic tools, the rapid growth of synthetic biology in research, innovation, and policy interest has been seen [1]. The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method. The third is the creation of a completely new biological system and even artificial life after the first two fields have been well developed. By several decades' development of synthetic biology, great progresses in fundamental science and practical applications have been achieved. Furthermore, new breakthroughs will be brought to the biotechnology in the foreseeable future. \n\nSynthetic biology covers various aspects, including genetic circuits, minimal genomes, DNA synthesis, and genetic modification [2]. And also, synthetic biology can be developed in organisms with reverse genetic tools and methodologies, including genetic transformation, selection markers, specific plasmid vectors, different promoters, and other advanced molecular biology techniques, such as (zinc finger proteins) ZFPs, (transcription activators like effector nucleases) TALENs, and (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) CRISPR [3,4]. To provide insight to further understand synthetic biology and discuss future perspectives in this area, the most updated techniques occurring in synthetic biology are summarized in this review.",

These technologies are now starting to be employed in a very exciting and nascent field -synthetic biology, as reviewed in this editorial. Some concepts from protein engineering have also been borrowed by synthetic biologists. For example, rational design and directed evolution, two general strategies for protein engineering [28], have been deployed in synthetic biology [26 27]. More techniques of protein engineering are expected to be used in synthetic biology in the future.\n\nOne area of protein engineering not mentioned in this editorial involves unnatural amino acids [29]. There are a few examples of the application of unnatural amino acids in synthetic biology [30]. Since unnatural amino acids can be used to functionalize proteins and immobilize pathway enzymes in vivo, one potential application is to channel substrates for synthetic pathways to improve pathway productivity, in a similar fashion to the synthetic scaffold structure approach described above [24].\n\nWith the rapid development of \"-omics\" technologies, an overwhelming amount of biological data have become available [31]. In addition, computational power has been dramatically expanding and molecular modeling has become more accurate. All these developments make rational design more attractive, rapid, and powerful. As a result, more rational and semi-rational designs are likely to be seen in protein engineering and its applications to synthetic biology going forward.\n\nWhile we appreciate the importance of protein engineering to synthetic biology, we should not underestimate the role of synthetic biology in further advancing protein engineering. For example, synthetic biology can be used to develop more efficient highthroughput screening methods to capitalize on protein engineering techniques [32].\n\nIt is clear that the marriage of protein engineering and synthetic biology promises to be a fruitful one. Trained to think on a molecular level, protein engineers and synthetic biologists routinely \"think big\" while working on the small [e.g. microbial cells]. And though these ideas are all implemented first in microscopic single cells, the biggest of them will surely do nothing less than change the world.",

While protein engineering continues to play an important role in established industries like detergent enzymes, it also promises to provide new solutions in emerging industries such as biopharmaceuticals [evolved biologics] and renewable energy [engineered enzymes for biofuel production].\n## Conclusion and Perspectives\nIn the past several decades, particularly the past two, many robust and efficient protein engineering technologies have been developed. These technologies are now starting to be employed in a very exciting and nascent field -synthetic biology, as reviewed in this editorial. Some concepts from protein engineering have also been borrowed by synthetic biologists. For example, rational design and directed evolution, two general strategies for protein engineering [28], have been deployed in synthetic biology [26 27]. More techniques of protein engineering are expected to be used in synthetic biology in the future.\n\nOne area of protein engineering not mentioned in this editorial involves unnatural amino acids [29]. There are a few examples of the application of unnatural amino acids in synthetic biology [30]. Since unnatural amino acids can be used to functionalize proteins and immobilize pathway enzymes in vivo, one potential application is to channel substrates for synthetic pathways to improve pathway productivity, in a similar fashion to the synthetic scaffold structure approach described above [24].\n\nWith the rapid development of \"-omics\" technologies, an overwhelming amount of biological data have become available [31]. In addition, computational power has been dramatically expanding and molecular modeling has become more accurate. All these developments make rational design more attractive, rapid, and powerful. As a result, more rational and semi-rational designs are likely to be seen in protein engineering and its applications to synthetic biology going forward.\n\nWhile we appreciate the importance of protein engineering to synthetic biology, we should not underestimate the role of synthetic biology in further advancing protein engineering. For example, synthetic biology can be used to develop more efficient highthroughput screening methods to capitalize on protein engineering techniques [32].\n\nIt is clear that the marriage of protein engineering and synthetic biology promises to be a fruitful one. Trained to think on a molecular level, protein engineers and synthetic biologists routinely \"think big\" while working on the small [e.g. microbial cells]. And though these ideas are all implemented first in microscopic single cells, the biggest of them will surely do nothing less than change the world.",

Unlike organic synthesis successfully developed in the early 19 th century, 2 synthetic biology is restricted by DNA, RNA and protein technology within the complexity of biological systems. Today, synthetic biology has been developed extensively. It becomes a multidisciplinary field aims to develop new biological parts, systems, or even individuals based on existing knowledge. Researchers can apply the engineering paradigm to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature. Synthetic biology is tightly connected with many subjects including biotechnology, biomaterials and molecular biology, providing methodology and disciplines to these fields. \n\nThe timeline of synthetic biology developments is summarized here (Fig. 1). In general, the history of synthetic biology can be divided into three stages. The initial stage was found across the 20th century. Although the simplest organisms such as virus particles, bacteria, archaea and fungi were hard to engineer in the 20th century, some achievements were still acquired in the early explorations including the synthesis of crystalline bovine insulin, 3 chemical synthesis of DNA and RNA, 4 decoding of genetic codes 5 and the establishment of central dogma of molecular biology. 6 ynthetic biology has been accumulating its strengths in this period, as knowledge of genome biology and molecular biology are developed rapidly at the end of the 20th century (Fig. 1). \n\nThe development stage begins in the 21 st century. In the first decade of the new millennium, synthetic biology is known to every biological researcher to include inventions of bioswitches, 7 gene circuits based on quorum sensing signals, 8 yeast cell-factory for amorphadiene synthesis 9 (Table 1), BioBrick standardized assembly 10 and the iGEM conferences 11 (Fig. 1). Two principles in synthetic biology designs have been considered in this stage including bottle-up 12 and top-down 13 ones, referring to the de novo creations of artificial lives by assembling basic biological molecules and engineering natural-existed cells to meet actual demands, respectively.",

During the past decades, progresses have been made to build delicate biocircuits, standardized biological building blocks and to develop various genomic/metabolic engineering tools and approaches. Medical and pharmaceutical demands have also pushed the development of synthetic biology, including integration of heterologous pathways into designer cells to efficiently produce medical agents, enhanced yields of natural products in cell growth media to equal or higher than that of the extracts from plants or fungi, constructions of novel genetic circuits for tumor targeting, controllable releases of therapeutic agents in response to specific biomarkers to fight diseases such as diabetes and cancers. Besides, new strategies are developed to treat complex immune diseases, infectious diseases and metabolic disorders that are hard to cure via traditional approaches. In general, synthetic biology brings new capabilities to medical and pharmaceutical researches. This review summarizes the timeline of synthetic biology developments, the past and present of synthetic biology for microbial productions of pharmaceutics, engineered cells equipped with synthetic DNA circuits for diagnosis and therapies, live and auto-assemblied biomaterials for medical treatments, cell-free synthetic biology in medical and pharmaceutical fields, and DNA engineering approaches with potentials for biomedical applications.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe concept of synthetic biology was proposed in 1910s by Stephane Le Duc. 1 In this field, research strategies have been changed from the description and analysis of biological events to design and manipulate desired signal/metabolic routes, similar to the already defined organic synthesis. Unlike organic synthesis successfully developed in the early 19 th century, 2 synthetic biology is restricted by DNA, RNA and protein technology within the complexity of biological systems. Today, synthetic biology has been developed extensively. It becomes a multidisciplinary field aims to develop new biological parts, systems, or even individuals based on existing knowledge. Researchers can apply the engineering paradigm to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature. Synthetic biology is tightly connected with many subjects including biotechnology, biomaterials and molecular biology, providing methodology and disciplines to these fields. \n\nThe timeline of synthetic biology developments is summarized here (Fig. 1). In general, the history of synthetic biology can be divided into three stages. The initial stage was found across the 20th century. Although the simplest organisms such as virus particles, bacteria, archaea and fungi were hard to engineer in the 20th century, some achievements were still acquired in the early explorations including the synthesis of crystalline bovine insulin, 3 chemical synthesis of DNA and RNA, 4 decoding of genetic codes 5 and the establishment of central dogma of molecular biology. 6 ynthetic biology has been accumulating its strengths in this period, as knowledge of genome biology and molecular biology are developed rapidly at the end of the 20th century (Fig. 1). \n\nThe development stage begins in the 21 st century. In the first decade of the new millennium, synthetic biology is known to every biological researcher to include inventions of bioswitches, 7 gene circuits based on quorum sensing signals, 8 yeast cell-factory for amorphadiene synthesis 9 (Table 1), BioBrick standardized assembly 10 and the iGEM conferences 11 (Fig. 1). Two principles in synthetic biology designs have been considered in this stage including bottle-up 12 and top-down 13 ones, referring to the de novo creations of artificial lives by assembling basic biological molecules and engineering natural-existed cells to meet actual demands, respectively.",

The key aspect of preparing these biological systems is the availability of appropriate strategies for designing novel genetic circuits. However, there remains a pressing need to explore independent and controllable systems for the co-expression of multiple genes. Results In this study, we present the characterisation of a set of bacterial plasmids dedicated to recombinant expression in broadly used Escherichia coli. The set includes plasmids with four different, most commonly used bacterial expression cassettes - RhaS/RhaBAD, LacI/Trc, AraC/AraBAD, and XylS/Pm, which can be used alone or freely combined in up to three-gene monocistronic expression systems using Golden Standard Molecular Cloning kit assembly. The independent induction of each of the designed cassettes enables the autonomous expression of up to three recombinant proteins from one plasmid. The expression of a triple-enzyme cascade consisting of sucrose synthase, UDP-rhamnose synthase and flavonol-7-O-rhamnosyltransferase, confirmed that the designed system can be applied for the complex biocatalysts production.

                    "text": "In the field of synthetic genomics, the de novo design and synthesis capabilities of DNA sequences have evolved from a single gene to the entire microbial genome. Viruses, prokaryotic genomes and eukaryotic chromosomes have been successfully synthesized in the past research studies [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]. At the same time, the existing enabling technology allows introduction of complex exogenous metabolic pathways into specific microbial hosts with particular modifications to achieve specific goals. In recent years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology, microbial remediation has been drawing increased attention and shown the great potential in degrading pollutants compared to traditional physical and chemical methods. In the last decade, by the means of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" engineering approaches, synthetic biology has been proven to be a very powerful tool in utilization and modification of existing genetic materials to redesign organisms with desired abilities. Taking \"Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)\" biological engineering cycle, the standardized and universal biological component modules could be designed, constructed, integrated, tested and optimized in simple chassis cells to achieve efficient operation of a quantitative and controllable platform-based new living system [29]. The reconstruction of synthetic pathways in dedicated chassis cells for natural product production (e.g. artemisinin, avermectin, resveratrol, or penicillin) has been successfully conducted in this strategy [30]. These results have not only achieved great academic and commercial success, so that more and more researchers are focusing on the synthesis of medicines and raw materials (see Table 1). However, synthetic biology is not yet widely applied in engineering the catabolism pathways in microbes so far. Therefore, the field of synthetic biology is increasingly expanding from a focus on natural products to pollutants degradation by engineering microbes, and artificially synthesized catabolic pathways provide a new approach for environmental bioremediation [33].",

A core principle of the synthetic biology approach is a model-guided design and based on the biological understanding of the process, models of prokaryotic protein production have been described. Translation initiation rate is a rate-limiting step in protein production from mRNA and is dependent on the sequence of the 5\u2032-untranslated region and the start of the coding sequence. Translation rate calculators are programs that estimate protein translation rates based on the sequence of these regions of an mRNA, and as protein expression is proportional to the rate of translation initiation, such calculators have been shown to give good approximations of protein expression levels. In this review, three currently available translation rate calculators developed for synthetic biology are considered, with limitations and possible future progress discussed.",

                    "text": "Synthetic biology is a recently emerged field concerned with engineering complex living systems by assembling individually characterized biological parts in novel combinations. The discipline arose from the discovery of the mathematical logic of gene pairings, as well as from advances made in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The development of de novo DNA synthesis, protein engineering, and the designs of artificial gene networks have greatly contributed to the field's advancement (Heinemann and Panke, 2006). Synthetic biology seeks to determine the behavior of organisms and their parts, and then to modify and combine them into complete specific tasks. The field is based on the engineering principles of design and fabrication and focuses on the concept of standardized parts (Serrano, 2007). Precise control over the levels of protein expression is an important requirement for the robust operation of complex synthetic circuits built from many parts. \n\nDespite improving characterization and assembly methods, cycles of design, fabrication, and testing in synthetic biology can be slow. Production of circuits with desired properties can require several rounds of testing and modifying, each time editing imperfect parts by mutation or identifying alternatives. Directed evolution has been shown to provide a short cut through this phase (Yokobayashi et al., 2002), but is complicated by the additional work needed to couple networks to selective pressures. Instead, use of predictive mathematical modeling to rationally guide the design of gene networks can greatly improve design cycles to accelerate advances in synthetic biology (Ellis et al., 2009). \n\nLevels of protein expression are affected by both the transcription and translation rates but early genetic engineering approaches usually focused solely on transcription (Lipniacki et al., 2006). The transcription rate's heavy dependence on the promoter strength and the relative ease of estimating binding affinity of RNA polymerase helped its early popularity (Alper et al., 2005). However, to gain more accurate and efficient control over protein expression translation rates must also be considered. \n\nTranslation initiation is one of the major steps in translation and plays a large role in determining the overall translation rate (Laursen et al., 2005;Kudla et al., 2009).",

Hargest, Charlie Gilbert, T. Ellis\n## Abstract\nIn synthetic biology, precise control over protein expression is required in order to construct functional biological systems. A core principle of the synthetic biology approach is a model-guided design and based on the biological understanding of the process, models of prokaryotic protein production have been described. Translation initiation rate is a rate-limiting step in protein production from mRNA and is dependent on the sequence of the 5\u2032-untranslated region and the start of the coding sequence. Translation rate calculators are programs that estimate protein translation rates based on the sequence of these regions of an mRNA, and as protein expression is proportional to the rate of translation initiation, such calculators have been shown to give good approximations of protein expression levels. In this review, three currently available translation rate calculators developed for synthetic biology are considered, with limitations and possible future progress discussed.\n## INTRODUCTION\nSynthetic biology is a recently emerged field concerned with engineering complex living systems by assembling individually characterized biological parts in novel combinations. The discipline arose from the discovery of the mathematical logic of gene pairings, as well as from advances made in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The development of de novo DNA synthesis, protein engineering, and the designs of artificial gene networks have greatly contributed to the field's advancement (Heinemann and Panke, 2006). Synthetic biology seeks to determine the behavior of organisms and their parts, and then to modify and combine them into complete specific tasks. The field is based on the engineering principles of design and fabrication and focuses on the concept of standardized parts (Serrano, 2007). Precise control over the levels of protein expression is an important requirement for the robust operation of complex synthetic circuits built from many parts. \n\nDespite improving characterization and assembly methods, cycles of design, fabrication, and testing in synthetic biology can be slow. Production of circuits with desired properties can require several rounds of testing and modifying, each time editing imperfect parts by mutation or identifying alternatives. Directed evolution has been shown to provide a short cut through this phase (Yokobayashi et al., 2002), but is complicated by the additional work needed to couple networks to selective pressures. Instead, use of predictive mathematical modeling to rationally guide the design of gene networks can greatly improve design cycles to accelerate advances in synthetic biology (Ellis et al., 2009). \n\nLevels of protein expression are affected by both the transcription and translation rates but early genetic engineering approaches usually focused solely on transcription (Lipniacki et al., 2006). The transcription rate's heavy dependence on the promoter strength and the relative ease of estimating binding affinity of RNA polymerase helped its early popularity (Alper et al., 2005). However, to gain more accurate and efficient control over protein expression translation rates must also be considered. \n\nTranslation initiation is one of the major steps in translation and plays a large role in determining the overall translation rate (Laursen et al., 2005;Kudla et al., 2009).",

The natural outcome of such an advance is synthetic biology, which deals with the design and assembly of predictable and robust biological parts/systems and systems biology, which aims at system-level understanding of biological systems. These well-characterized and novel biological parts/systems would in turn provide useful drugs, green fuels, or other high value biomaterials [1,2]. Synthetic biologists differ from genetic engineers in that they try to engineer and create complex biological systems for practical applications from lesser understood and unreliable basic components [3]. Systems biologists develop tools of modeling, simulation, and comparison to experiment in order to understand complex biological systems. The systems biology approach will be especially useful in synthetic biology. Challenges associated with the progress in synthetic biology and systems biology will be the focus of this review. \n\nThe two main challenges that limit the progress of synthetic biology are the complexity of the biological systems and the physical variations in biological behavior. These limitations lead to an uncertain probability of success of the engineered biological systems and an inability to fully predict even a simple component [3,4]. Despite several advances in synthetic biology, engineering biological systems is still an expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable process [4]. The response of a biological system is usually nonlinear in that even a simple pathway in a well-studied microorganism cannot be explained satisfactorily. The task of creating an artificial biological system is made more complex with the increase in the complexity of the novel genetic circuits. \n\nUnlike other electrical systems in which interactions between individual components are well characterized and the components operate independently, with the biological components, one cannot avoid undesirable crosstalk due to nonspecific interactions with other components in the cell. Understanding the overall behavior of the natural system is a prerequisite for the successful design of a synthetic biological system. High-throughput experimental methods are necessary to understand the complexity associated with biological systems [5]. Automated, multiplex, and parallel reactions are mandatory in order to gain a deeper insight into the complex biological systems.",

Kim, J. Park, Taesung Kim, Sung Kuk Lee\n## Abstract\nMicrofluidic technologies have shown powerful abilities for reducing cost, time, and labor, and at the same time, for increasing accuracy, throughput, and performance in the analysis of biological and biochemical samples compared with the conventional, macroscale instruments. Synthetic biology is an emerging field of biology and has drawn much attraction due to its potential to create novel, functional biological parts and systems for special purposes. Since it is believed that the development of synthetic biology can be accelerated through the use of microfluidic technology, in this review work we focus our discussion on the latest microfluidic technologies that can provide unprecedented means in synthetic biology for dynamic profiling of gene expression/regulation with high resolution, highly sensitive on-chip and off-chip detection of metabolites, and whole-cell analysis.\n## Synthetic Biology\nThe development of bioinformatics and functional genomics has enabled not only the ability to understand or modify existing biological systems but also to create new biological systems for special purposes. The natural outcome of such an advance is synthetic biology, which deals with the design and assembly of predictable and robust biological parts/systems and systems biology, which aims at system-level understanding of biological systems. These well-characterized and novel biological parts/systems would in turn provide useful drugs, green fuels, or other high value biomaterials [1,2]. Synthetic biologists differ from genetic engineers in that they try to engineer and create complex biological systems for practical applications from lesser understood and unreliable basic components [3]. Systems biologists develop tools of modeling, simulation, and comparison to experiment in order to understand complex biological systems. The systems biology approach will be especially useful in synthetic biology. Challenges associated with the progress in synthetic biology and systems biology will be the focus of this review. \n\nThe two main challenges that limit the progress of synthetic biology are the complexity of the biological systems and the physical variations in biological behavior. These limitations lead to an uncertain probability of success of the engineered biological systems and an inability to fully predict even a simple component [3,4]. Despite several advances in synthetic biology, engineering biological systems is still an expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable process [4]. The response of a biological system is usually nonlinear in that even a simple pathway in a well-studied microorganism cannot be explained satisfactorily. The task of creating an artificial biological system is made more complex with the increase in the complexity of the novel genetic circuits. \n\nUnlike other electrical systems in which interactions between individual components are well characterized and the components operate independently, with the biological components, one cannot avoid undesirable crosstalk due to nonspecific interactions with other components in the cell. Understanding the overall behavior of the natural system is a prerequisite for the successful design of a synthetic biological system. High-throughput experimental methods are necessary to understand the complexity associated with biological systems [5]. Automated, multiplex, and parallel reactions are mandatory in order to gain a deeper insight into the complex biological systems.",

Since then, our understanding of the properties and reactivity of organic molecules and the physical principles that compose living systems has progressed at a strong pace. This accumulation of knowledge over the years helped set the framework for the emergence of modern synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology consists of the manipulation and rationalization of complex biological processes to design or re-purpose biological systems for useful applications (Purnick and Weiss, 2009). As with any engineering device, a certain level of abstraction is necessary to obtain a functional representation of a complex problem. For synthetic biology, the various biological components of the complex problem being investigated are represented in terms of biological parts or devices. These biological parts or devices could be 'plugged-in' to a microbial chassis to address a given need. Once 'plugged-in' to the chassis, these parts begin interacting under the corresponding genetic programme which encodes the target function. \n\nWith the assistance of genetic engineering, synthetic biology has rapidly advanced over the last few years for certain well-characterized organisms such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. However, one major challenge in this area is the dearth of diversity when choosing a platform organism to use as a chassis. \n\nNevertheless, selection of a suitable host system is one of the main determinants of the technology, molecular tools, equipment and reagents needed to perform a chosen project. With the importance of suitable organism selection obvious, the selection should be made with the nature of the desired final product in mind at all times. \n\nThe work by Calero and Nikel (2018) reviews the predominant bacterial expression systems that have been successfully utilized in the field and the preferable properties that an ideal chassis should have for its use as a cell-factory to avoid the non-desirable drawbacks that could occur as a consequence of the expression of heterologous pathways in a given bacterial host. The ability to assemble protein-coding sequences from different organisms into a single circuit would provide synthetic biologists with a considerable degree of flexibility in chassis selection for the design of novel systems.",

Abram, Zulema Udaondo\n## Abstract\nHighlight of the work of Calero and Nikel published in Microbial Biotechnology journal a few months ago.\n## body\nAlmost two hundred years have passed since the birth of synthetic organic chemistry when the German chemist Friedrich W\u20ac ohler, performed the synthesis of urea in 1828 (W\u20ac ohler, 1828). Since then, our understanding of the properties and reactivity of organic molecules and the physical principles that compose living systems has progressed at a strong pace. This accumulation of knowledge over the years helped set the framework for the emergence of modern synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology consists of the manipulation and rationalization of complex biological processes to design or re-purpose biological systems for useful applications (Purnick and Weiss, 2009). As with any engineering device, a certain level of abstraction is necessary to obtain a functional representation of a complex problem. For synthetic biology, the various biological components of the complex problem being investigated are represented in terms of biological parts or devices. These biological parts or devices could be 'plugged-in' to a microbial chassis to address a given need. Once 'plugged-in' to the chassis, these parts begin interacting under the corresponding genetic programme which encodes the target function. \n\nWith the assistance of genetic engineering, synthetic biology has rapidly advanced over the last few years for certain well-characterized organisms such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. However, one major challenge in this area is the dearth of diversity when choosing a platform organism to use as a chassis. \n\nNevertheless, selection of a suitable host system is one of the main determinants of the technology, molecular tools, equipment and reagents needed to perform a chosen project. With the importance of suitable organism selection obvious, the selection should be made with the nature of the desired final product in mind at all times. \n\nThe work by Calero and Nikel (2018) reviews the predominant bacterial expression systems that have been successfully utilized in the field and the preferable properties that an ideal chassis should have for its use as a cell-factory to avoid the non-desirable drawbacks that could occur as a consequence of the expression of heterologous pathways in a given bacterial host. The ability to assemble protein-coding sequences from different organisms into a single circuit would provide synthetic biologists with a considerable degree of flexibility in chassis selection for the design of novel systems.",

In this review, we attempt to contextualize the areas of synthetic biology into three tiers: (1) the process units and associated streams of the central dogma, (2) the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, and (3) the extrinsic physical and chemical environment. Efforts at each of these three tiers attempt to control cellular systems and take advantage of emerging tools and approaches. Ultimately, it will be possible to integrate these approaches and realize the vision of integrative synthetic biology when cells are completely rewired for biotechnological goals. This review will highlight progress towards this goal as well as areas requiring further research.",

These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

In this review, we attempt to contextualize the areas of synthetic biology into three tiers: (1) the process units and associated streams of the central dogma, (2) the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, and (3) the extrinsic physical and chemical environment. Efforts at each of these three tiers attempt to control cellular systems and take advantage of emerging tools and approaches. Ultimately, it will be possible to integrate these approaches and realize the vision of integrative synthetic biology when cells are completely rewired for biotechnological goals. This review will highlight progress towards this goal as well as areas requiring further research.\n## The First Tier-Process Optimization of the Central Dogma\nThe first tier of synthetic biology focuses on altering the general process flow-specifically modifications to the function and behavior of the process units (transcription [32] and translation) and the associated process streams (DNA, RNA [33], and protein). These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

However, it remains a challenge to efficiently produce l-Arg by Escherichia coli (E. coli). In the present study, we obtained an E. coli A1 with l-Arg accumulation ability, and carried out a series of metabolic engineering on it, and finally obtained an E. coli strain A7 with high l-Arg production ability. First, genome analysis of strain A1 was performed to explore the related genes affecting l-Arg accumulation. We found that gene speC and gene speF played an important role in the accumulation of l-Arg. Second, we used two strategies to solve the feedback inhibition of the l-Arg pathway in E. coli. One was the combination of a mutation of the gene argA and the deletion of the gene argR, and the other was the combination of a heterologous insertion of the gene argJ and the deletion of the gene argR. The combination of exogenous argJ gene insertion and argR gene deletion achieved higher titer accumulation with less impact on strain growth. Finally, we inserted the gene cluster argCJBDF of Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) to enhance the metabolic flux of the l-Arg pathway in E. coli. The final strain obtained 70.1 g/L l-Arg in a 5-L bioreactor, with a yield of 0.326 g/g glucose and a productivity of 1.17 g/(L\u00b7 h). This was the highest level of l-Arg production by E. coli ever reported. Collectively, our findings provided valuable insights into the possibility of the industrial production of l-Arg by E. coli.",

However, it remains a challenge to efficiently produce l-Arg by Escherichia coli (E. coli). In the present study, we obtained an E. coli A1 with l-Arg accumulation ability, and carried out a series of metabolic engineering on it, and finally obtained an E. coli strain A7 with high l-Arg production ability. First, genome analysis of strain A1 was performed to explore the related genes affecting l-Arg accumulation. We found that gene speC and gene speF played an important role in the accumulation of l-Arg. Second, we used two strategies to solve the feedback inhibition of the l-Arg pathway in E. coli. One was the combination of a mutation of the gene argA and the deletion of the gene argR, and the other was the combination of a heterologous insertion of the gene argJ and the deletion of the gene argR. The combination of exogenous argJ gene insertion and argR gene deletion achieved higher titer accumulation with less impact on strain growth. Finally, we inserted the gene cluster argCJBDF of Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) to enhance the metabolic flux of the l-Arg pathway in E. coli. The final strain obtained 70.1 g/L l-Arg in a 5-L bioreactor, with a yield of 0.326 g/g glucose and a productivity of 1.17 g/(L\u00b7 h). This was the highest level of l-Arg production by E. coli ever reported. Collectively, our findings provided valuable insights into the possibility of the industrial production of l-Arg by E. coli.\n## Background\nSynthetic biology plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass. The sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools has developed as synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity. In the past 20 years, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity of efforts within the space of synthetic biology has occurred [1]. Due to the great development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to complicated refactoring efforts [2][3][4] that can produce medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxadiene, etc.) [5,6] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc.) [7,8] in a high titer. \n\nAmong many systems available for heterologous protein production, the Gram-negative bacterium Open Access *Correspondence: 87062@cau.edu.cn 1 State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Ministry of Agriculture Feed Industry Centre, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Escherichia coli remains one of the most attractive organisms because of its ability to grow rapidly and at high density on inexpensive substrates. Well-characterized genetics and availability of a large number of cloning vectors and mutant host strains [9]. As a commonly used organism for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways, E. coli has been the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [10,11]. E. coli is a facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating bacterium that is considered as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of bio-fuels and biochemicals [12]. Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of transcription, translation and protein folding in E. coli, together with developments of improved genetic tools have made E. coli more valuable than ever [9].",

Palsson, Byung-Kwan Cho\n## Abstract\nHeterologous production of recombinant proteins is gaining increasing interest in biotechnology with respect to productivity, scalability, and wide applicability. The members of genus Streptomyces have been proposed as remarkable hosts for heterologous production due to their versatile nature of expressing various secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and secretory enzymes. However, there are several issues that limit their use, including low yield, difficulty in genetic manipulation, and their complex cellular features. In this review, we summarize rational engineering approaches to optimizing the heterologous production of secondary metabolites and recombinant proteins in Streptomyces species in terms of genetic tool development and chassis construction. Further perspectives on the development of optimal Streptomyces chassis by the design-build-test-learn cycle in systems are suggested, which may increase the availability of secondary metabolites and recombinant proteins.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis review focuses on rational engineering examples and perspectives of heterologous expression of BGCs and recombinant proteins in Streptomyces. Heterologous expression is an effective strategy for overcoming the native host in terms of growth, ease of genetic manipulation, and production yield. \n\nStreptomyces is an attractive heterologous expression host for BGCs and recombinant protein genes because of its functional biosynthetic enzyme expression, substrate availability, secretion systems, and other accessory genes.

However, this system can only work in some bacterial strains in which the T7 RNA Polymerase gene resides in the chromosome. In this study, we successfully introduced a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA Polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter into Escherichia coli BW25113. The T7 Expression System worked efficiently in this mutant strain named BW25113-T7. We demonstrated that this mutant strain could satisfactorily produce 5-Aminolevulinic Acid via C5 pathway. A final study was designed to enhance the controllability of T7 Expression System in this mutant strain by constructing a T7 Promoter Variants Library. These efforts advanced E. coli BW25113-T7 to be a practical host for future metabolic engineering efforts.",

In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

Qiao\n## Abstract\nT7 Expression System is a common method of ensuring tight control and high-level induced expression. However, this system can only work in some bacterial strains in which the T7 RNA Polymerase gene resides in the chromosome. In this study, we successfully introduced a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA Polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter into Escherichia coli BW25113. The T7 Expression System worked efficiently in this mutant strain named BW25113-T7. We demonstrated that this mutant strain could satisfactorily produce 5-Aminolevulinic Acid via C5 pathway. A final study was designed to enhance the controllability of T7 Expression System in this mutant strain by constructing a T7 Promoter Variants Library. These efforts advanced E. coli BW25113-T7 to be a practical host for future metabolic engineering efforts.\n## Introduction\nMetabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

Qiao\n## Abstract\nT7 Expression System is a common method of ensuring tight control and high-level induced expression. However, this system can only work in some bacterial strains in which the T7 RNA Polymerase gene resides in the chromosome. In this study, we successfully introduced a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA Polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter into Escherichia coli BW25113. The T7 Expression System worked efficiently in this mutant strain named BW25113-T7. We demonstrated that this mutant strain could satisfactorily produce 5-Aminolevulinic Acid via C5 pathway. A final study was designed to enhance the controllability of T7 Expression System in this mutant strain by constructing a T7 Promoter Variants Library. These efforts advanced E. coli BW25113-T7 to be a practical host for future metabolic engineering efforts.\n## Introduction\nMetabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

                    "text": "The synthesis of proteins and DNA, combined with the establishment of biocentric laws, laid the foundation for the idea of creating living organisms from scratch, leading to the rapid development of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that integrates concepts and techniques from biology, engineering, computer science, and molecular biology. It is typically defined as the redesign or engineering of existing biological components and systems using specific technologies to achieve a desired function [157] . In 2010, Gibson et al. created the first synthetic genomic cell, employing a bottom-up approach in which chemically synthesized DNA fragments were assembled to form a minimal genome necessary for the basic functioning of an organism [158] . This minimal genome offers advantages in stability and efficiency, but challenges remain, such as the difficulty of synthesizing long DNA sequences from scratch [159] . In contrast, the field of engineered bacteria often adopts a top-down strategy, which involves modifying existing organisms by removing non-essential genes from their genomes. This process frees up space and energy to optimize the expression of target genes [160] . For example, studies have shown that heterologous protein production in Lactobacillus lactis NZ9000 is significantly improved when 2.83% of the non-essential genome is deleted using the Cre-loxP deletion system [161] . Plasmid-based expression systems are commonly used in engineered bacteria, but they face limitations for clinical applications due to issues with genetic instability and the potential for biological contamination. As a result, gene-editing technologies, particularly those based on the CRISPR-Cas system, are emerging as powerful tools. These technologies have the potential to stabilize and modify probiotic genomes, enabling the alteration of their metabolic pathways and biological properties for more precise and reliable applications. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas system is an acquired immune mechanism found in most archaea and approximately half of all bacteria, where it functions to recognize and excise invading viral DNA [162] . This system consists of two main components: the sequence responsible for encoding Cas-related proteins and the CRISPR array, which contains a series of repeats interspersed with spacer sequences. The spacer sequences store fragments of foreign genetic material, allowing the organism to \"remember\" previous invaders [163] .",

This beneficial effect has spurred extensive research in the medical and health fields. With rapid advancements in synthetic biology, the genetic and biological characteristics of a broad array of probiotics have been elucidated. Utilizing these insights, genetic editing technologies now enable the precise modification of probiotics, leading to the development of engineered bacteria. Emerging evidence underscores the significant potential of these engineered bacteria in disease management. This review explores the methodologies for creating engineered bacteria, their preliminary applications in healthcare, and the mechanisms underlying their functions. Engineered bacteria are being developed for roles such as in vivo drug delivery systems, biosensors, and mucosal vaccines, thereby contributing to the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. The review concludes by assessing the advantages and limitations of engineered bacteria in the context of disease management.\n## SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND CRISPR/CAS SYSTEM\nThe synthesis of proteins and DNA, combined with the establishment of biocentric laws, laid the foundation for the idea of creating living organisms from scratch, leading to the rapid development of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that integrates concepts and techniques from biology, engineering, computer science, and molecular biology. It is typically defined as the redesign or engineering of existing biological components and systems using specific technologies to achieve a desired function [157] . In 2010, Gibson et al. created the first synthetic genomic cell, employing a bottom-up approach in which chemically synthesized DNA fragments were assembled to form a minimal genome necessary for the basic functioning of an organism [158] . This minimal genome offers advantages in stability and efficiency, but challenges remain, such as the difficulty of synthesizing long DNA sequences from scratch [159] . In contrast, the field of engineered bacteria often adopts a top-down strategy, which involves modifying existing organisms by removing non-essential genes from their genomes. This process frees up space and energy to optimize the expression of target genes [160] . For example, studies have shown that heterologous protein production in Lactobacillus lactis NZ9000 is significantly improved when 2.83% of the non-essential genome is deleted using the Cre-loxP deletion system [161] . Plasmid-based expression systems are commonly used in engineered bacteria, but they face limitations for clinical applications due to issues with genetic instability and the potential for biological contamination. As a result, gene-editing technologies, particularly those based on the CRISPR-Cas system, are emerging as powerful tools. These technologies have the potential to stabilize and modify probiotic genomes, enabling the alteration of their metabolic pathways and biological properties for more precise and reliable applications. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas system is an acquired immune mechanism found in most archaea and approximately half of all bacteria, where it functions to recognize and excise invading viral DNA [162] . This system consists of two main components: the sequence responsible for encoding Cas-related proteins and the CRISPR array, which contains a series of repeats interspersed with spacer sequences. The spacer sequences store fragments of foreign genetic material, allowing the organism to \"remember\" previous invaders [163] .",

With increasing global awareness of health, energy, and environmental issues, prioritizing the exploration and application of synthetic biology has become inevitable, given the potential options that these new sciences could offer. Recent advances in synthetic biology tools have extended their use in basic sciences, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, and industries. This expansion and development become particularly useful for accelerating the invention and innovation in the field of synthetic biology.\n\nThe daunting complexity and barrier rendered by the cell membrane prompt numerous difficulties, such as experiment being hard to standardize, incompatibility issues, and variability. To address these issues, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, also known as in vitro protein synthesis, have emerged as a key tool that can work without the use of living cells. These systems allow one to directly control transcription, translation, and metabolism in an open source fashion (Carlson et al., 2012;Lu, 2017;Moore et al., 2017;Jiang et al., 2018;Yue et al., 2019). CFPS represents a historically important component in the field of biochemistry, duly acknowledging the pioneering effort made by Nobel laureate Eduard",

Bhattacharjee, Nisarg Gohil, D. Braddick, V. Kulkarni, Vijai Singh\n## Abstract\nCell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system is a simple, rapid, and sensitive tool that is devoid of membrane-bound barriers, yet contains all the mandatory substrates, biomolecules, and machineries required for the synthesis of the desired proteins. It has the potential to overcome loopholes in the current in vivo production systems and is a promising tool in both basic and applied scientific research. It facilitates a simplified organization of desired experiments with a variety of reaction conditions, making CFPS a powerful tool in biological research. It has been used for the expansion of genetic code, assembly of viruses, and in metabolic engineering for production of toxic and complex proteins. Subsequently, CFPS systems have emerged as potent technology for high-throughput production of membrane proteins, enzymes, and therapeutics. The present review highlights the recent advances and uses of CFPS systems in biomedical, therapeutic, and biotechnological applications. Additionally, we highlight possible solutions to the potential biosafety issues that may be encountered while using CFPS technology.\n## INTRODUCTION\nartificial insemination (Kemmer et al., 2011), and many more. Synthetic chromosomes (Gibson et al., 2009(Gibson et al., , 2010Kosuri et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2012;Hutchison et al., 2016) and multiplex automated genome engineering (Wang et al., 2009(Wang et al., , 2012Isaacs et al., 2011;Lajoie et al., 2013;Rovner et al., 2015) have also been developed by utilizing the synthetic biology toolboxes.\n\nThe reach of synthetic biology-mediated genome engineering has been significant in a wide range of organisms that currently include bacteria, viruses, yeast, Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells (Cong et al., 2013;DiCarlo et al., 2013;Hwang et al., 2013;Jiang et al., 2013;Mali et al., 2013;Port et al., 2014;Ren et al., 2014;Hisano et al., 2015;Jako\u010diunas et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2015;Singh et al., 2017Singh et al., , 2018. With increasing global awareness of health, energy, and environmental issues, prioritizing the exploration and application of synthetic biology has become inevitable, given the potential options that these new sciences could offer. Recent advances in synthetic biology tools have extended their use in basic sciences, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, and industries. This expansion and development become particularly useful for accelerating the invention and innovation in the field of synthetic biology.\n\nThe daunting complexity and barrier rendered by the cell membrane prompt numerous difficulties, such as experiment being hard to standardize, incompatibility issues, and variability. To address these issues, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, also known as in vitro protein synthesis, have emerged as a key tool that can work without the use of living cells. These systems allow one to directly control transcription, translation, and metabolism in an open source fashion (Carlson et al., 2012;Lu, 2017;Moore et al., 2017;Jiang et al., 2018;Yue et al., 2019). CFPS represents a historically important component in the field of biochemistry, duly acknowledging the pioneering effort made by Nobel laureate Eduard",

These design failures are mainly due to intrinsic perturbations such as gene expression noises, splicing, mutation, uncertain initial states and disturbances such as changing extra-cellular environments, and interactions with cellular context.

The past decades have been marked by a remarkable progress in the genetic engineering of fungi to generate industry-compatible strains needed for some biotech applications. In this sense, progress in this field has been marked by the utilization of high-throughput techniques to gain deep understanding of the molecular machinery controlling the physiology of these organisms, starting thus the Systems Biology era of fungi. Additionally, genetic engineering has been extensively applied to modify wellcharacterized promoters in order to construct new expression systems with enhanced performance under the conditions of interest. In this review, we discuss some aspects related to significant progress in the understating and engineering of fungi for biotechnological applications, with special focus on the construction of synthetic promoters and circuits in organisms relevant for industry. Different engineering approaches are shown, and their potential and limitations for the construction of complex synthetic circuits in these organisms are examined. Finally, we discuss the impact of engineered promoter architecture in the single-cell behavior of the system, an often-neglected relationship with a tremendous impact in the final performance of the process of interest. We expect to provide here some new directions to drive future research directed to the construction of high-performance, engineered fungal strains working as microbial cell factories.",

In this sense, heterologous gene expression in prokaryotes [92] and eukaryotes [93] allowed the production of native and recombinant proteins that now are broadly used in medical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological, engineering, food and chemical industries [94,95]. Several characteristics should be considered when aiming the improvement of gene expression to produce an economically viable bioprocess [96,97]. Firstly, the appropriate host strain must be selected based on features such as the ability to sustain fast growth on a cheap media, the ability to be genetically modified and, for some applications, the capability to achieve post-transcriptional modification of enzymes. In the second place, selection between chromosomal or plasmidbased expression systems is also relevant [98]. Additionally, the recombinant protein should be easily extractable in a minimum number of steps. Finally, the strain must be considered as safe for its application to produce a recombinant protein [94,95]. Historically, engineering of microorganisms has focused on the modification of single genes in a very try and error approach [99], but more recently, Synthetic Biology has developed an overriding role in genetic engineering of living organisms [100,101].

Guazzaroni, L. M. Arruda, Rafael Silva-Rocha\n## Abstract\nFilamentous fungi are remarkable organisms naturally specialized in deconstructing plant biomass and this feature has a tremendous potential for biofuel production from renewable sources. The past decades have been marked by a remarkable progress in the genetic engineering of fungi to generate industry-compatible strains needed for some biotech applications. In this sense, progress in this field has been marked by the utilization of high-throughput techniques to gain deep understanding of the molecular machinery controlling the physiology of these organisms, starting thus the Systems Biology era of fungi. Additionally, genetic engineering has been extensively applied to modify wellcharacterized promoters in order to construct new expression systems with enhanced performance under the conditions of interest. In this review, we discuss some aspects related to significant progress in the understating and engineering of fungi for biotechnological applications, with special focus on the construction of synthetic promoters and circuits in organisms relevant for industry. Different engineering approaches are shown, and their potential and limitations for the construction of complex synthetic circuits in these organisms are examined. Finally, we discuss the impact of engineered promoter architecture in the single-cell behavior of the system, an often-neglected relationship with a tremendous impact in the final performance of the process of interest. We expect to provide here some new directions to drive future research directed to the construction of high-performance, engineered fungal strains working as microbial cell factories.\n## SYNTHETIC PROMOTER ENGINEERING FOR FUNGAL BIOTECHNOLOGY\nWhen considering the engineering of microorganisms for a particular application, perhaps the first strategy that comes to the mind of any researcher is the development of a more efficient expression system. In this sense, heterologous gene expression in prokaryotes [92] and eukaryotes [93] allowed the production of native and recombinant proteins that now are broadly used in medical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological, engineering, food and chemical industries [94,95]. Several characteristics should be considered when aiming the improvement of gene expression to produce an economically viable bioprocess [96,97]. Firstly, the appropriate host strain must be selected based on features such as the ability to sustain fast growth on a cheap media, the ability to be genetically modified and, for some applications, the capability to achieve post-transcriptional modification of enzymes. In the second place, selection between chromosomal or plasmidbased expression systems is also relevant [98]. Additionally, the recombinant protein should be easily extractable in a minimum number of steps. Finally, the strain must be considered as safe for its application to produce a recombinant protein [94,95]. Historically, engineering of microorganisms has focused on the modification of single genes in a very try and error approach [99], but more recently, Synthetic Biology has developed an overriding role in genetic engineering of living organisms [100,101]. Below, we present some useful concepts on the engineering of biological systems and their application in Fungal Synthetic Biology.",

New biological parts (genes, promoter sequence, terminators, etc.), devices (gene networks), and modules (biosynthetic pathways) are only limited by our imagination and the drive to create them. Also, without the advancement of methods for analyzing large amounts of data, bioinformatics, codon optimization software, genome mining, and user-friendly databases, synthetic biology creations are permeating in many laboratories around the world. With this in mind, we will review the current technologies for synthetic genes and genomes, and how this technology can be applied in generating novel regulatory circuits and even whole genomes. In this regard, E. coli is the key organism for such endeavors. Why? Well, in this section, we provide some examples that we consider may be helpful in the future of mankind and are in our opinion relevant in the field of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology is a relatively new branch of molecular genetics that incorporate engineering principles for modifying several aspects of cell physiology, rewiring genetic circuits, creating novel circuits, and synthesizing custom-made DNA sequences and even genomes [87]. This particular branch of biology needs to be supported by an extensive knowledge of the organism that modifications or even whole genome synthesis is attempted, several novel tools for analyzing big datasets and molecular tools for that particular organism, for the generation of sequences and the computational design of DNA molecules, and a goal that can be achieved with the desired organism. E. coli along with Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the most studied and well-comprehended organisms in science, and diverse phenotypes have been identified that are helpful for bioengineering [88,89]. \n\nMultiplexing is the novel approach for redesigning organisms to do desired tasks [90]. By cycling through design-build-test framework we can achieve novel features in existing proteins and can further the advancement of genetic engineering. Thus far the most complicated and time-consuming part of this framework is the testing of the novel designs.",

However, the properties of these materials are difficult to change, since natural biosynthetic mechanisms are difficult to explain, simulate, or adjust. Thus, many materials of biological origin are isolated from natural tissues or their substitutes are produced recombinantly, and then modified in the process of experimental application. A major shift in this paradigm is caused by the emerging field of synthetic biology, which introduces innovations in the \"tool kit\" of methods for tuning biomolecules and biosynthetic mechanisms. Relative to materials, this led to higher product titers due to reprogrammed natural biosynthesis and allowed the development of new materials by combining the desired domains. Here we can focus Review Article Malyutin et al.; JPRI, 33(17): 31-38, 2021; Article no.JPRI.66568 32 on recent applications of synthetic biology to bio-derived ribosomal and non-ribosomal polymer materials for biomedical applications. It is also interesting to describe modern methods that will affect the production and design of biomaterials in the near future. Continuous innovation at the intersection of synthetic biology and materials science promises to usher in a new era of biomaterial design and synthesis.",

Goncharov, A. Markov, Karina Nikolaevna Shalneva\n## Abstract\nMaterials that have a biological origin find many applications in both Biomedicine and other Sciences. However, the properties of these materials are difficult to change, since natural biosynthetic mechanisms are difficult to explain, simulate, or adjust. Thus, many materials of biological origin are isolated from natural tissues or their substitutes are produced recombinantly, and then modified in the process of experimental application. A major shift in this paradigm is caused by the emerging field of synthetic biology, which introduces innovations in the \"tool kit\" of methods for tuning biomolecules and biosynthetic mechanisms. Relative to materials, this led to higher product titers due to reprogrammed natural biosynthesis and allowed the development of new materials by combining the desired domains. Here we can focus Review Article Malyutin et al.; JPRI, 33(17): 31-38, 2021; Article no.JPRI.66568 32 on recent applications of synthetic biology to bio-derived ribosomal and non-ribosomal polymer materials for biomedical applications. It is also interesting to describe modern methods that will affect the production and design of biomaterials in the near future. Continuous innovation at the intersection of synthetic biology and materials science promises to usher in a new era of biomaterial design and synthesis.\n## BIOMEDICAL STRUCTURAL POLY-MERS\nThe split intein system involves the use of peptide domains attached to the ends of proteins that self-excise with minimal scarring when joined. \n\nRecently, Zhang et al. used this system to provide extracellular assembly of two very large recombinant spider silk spidroins (290 and 282 kDa) into a 556 kDa spider silk product [27]. \n\nResearchers studying the underwater adhesion properties of recombinant mussel foot proteins also used the split-intein system to assemble high-molecular oligomers with excellent adhesion properties.

            "text": "In the past several decades, particularly the past two, many robust and efficient protein engineering technologies have been developed. These technologies are now starting to be employed in a very exciting and nascent field -synthetic biology, as reviewed in this editorial. Some concepts from protein engineering have also been borrowed by synthetic biologists. For example, rational design and directed evolution, two general strategies for protein engineering [28], have been deployed in synthetic biology [26 27]. More techniques of protein engineering are expected to be used in synthetic biology in the future.\n\nOne area of protein engineering not mentioned in this editorial involves unnatural amino acids [29]. There are a few examples of the application of unnatural amino acids in synthetic biology [30]. Since unnatural amino acids can be used to functionalize proteins and immobilize pathway enzymes in vivo, one potential application is to channel substrates for synthetic pathways to improve pathway productivity, in a similar fashion to the synthetic scaffold structure approach described above [24].\n\nWith the rapid development of \"-omics\" technologies, an overwhelming amount of biological data have become available [31]. In addition, computational power has been dramatically expanding and molecular modeling has become more accurate. All these developments make rational design more attractive, rapid, and powerful. As a result, more rational and semi-rational designs are likely to be seen in protein engineering and its applications to synthetic biology going forward.\n\nWhile we appreciate the importance of protein engineering to synthetic biology, we should not underestimate the role of synthetic biology in further advancing protein engineering. For example, synthetic biology can be used to develop more efficient highthroughput screening methods to capitalize on protein engineering techniques [32].\n\nIt is clear that the marriage of protein engineering and synthetic biology promises to be a fruitful one. Trained to think on a molecular level, protein engineers and synthetic biologists routinely \"think big\" while working on the small [e.g. microbial cells]. And though these ideas are all implemented first in microscopic single cells, the biggest of them will surely do nothing less than change the world.",

This field has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly within the realms of medical science, biopharmaceuticals, agriculture, and biotechnological applications [1]. \n\nThe initial step involves the insertion of the target protein's gene into an expression vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector [2]. This Special Issue compiles 10 groundbreaking papers in the domain of active peptide and protein biosynthesis, as well as their applications and efficient expression systems, which have substantially contributed to our understanding of cutting-edge technologies in bioactive protein research. \n\nThe rapid advancement of modern biotechnology has enabled the production of recombinant proteins with tailored functionalities. This progress is largely attributed to innovations in protein engineering, which allow for the optimization of protein structures to meet specific functional requirements. Techniques such as directed evolution and rational design have been employed to enhance the properties of proteins, making them suitable for various applications in the biomedical and industrial sectors [3]. Moreover, recombinant proteins have played a crucial role in overcoming limitations of traditional drug delivery systems, with many proving highly efficient and some receiving FDA approval [4]. Despite certain advancements, the yield and practical applications of recombinant proteins remain suboptimal. \n\nThe production of recombinant proteins in microbial systems has revolutionized the field of biochemistry. However, downstream challenges include the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) [5], protein inactivity [6], and, in some cases, the complete absence of protein production [7]. Two articles in this Special Issue present effective methodologies for the efficient expression and application of recombinant proteins from diverse perspectives. \n\nSelecting the appropriate host cells for protein expression is crucial, followed by the optimization of expression systems. Yi Ma [8] utilized E. coli BL21 (DE3) as host bacteria and recombinantly expressed the lysis protein ID52-E of E. coli phage ID52 for the first time in order to study the application in producing bacterial ghosts (BGs) and to screen for the most efficient preparation system of BGs.",

            "text": "Many beneficial proteins have limited natural availability, which often restricts their supply and thereby reduces their potential for therapeutic or industrial usage. The advent of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology enables the utilization of different microbes as surrogate hosts to facilitate the production of these proteins. This microbial technology continues to evolve and integrate with modern innovations to develop more effective approaches for increasing the production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. These strategies encompass fermentation technology, metabolic engineering, the deployment of strong promoters, novel vector elements such as inducers and enhancers, protein tags, secretion signals, synthetic biology, high-throughput devices for cloning, and process screening. This appraisal commences with a general overview regarding the manufacture of recombinant proteins by microbes and the production of biopharmaceuticals, their trends towards the development of biopharmaceuticals, and then discusses the approaches adopted for accomplishing this. The design of the upstream process, which also involves host selection, vector design, and promoter design, is a crucial component of production strategies. On the other hand, the downstream process focuses on extraction and purification techniques. Additionally, the review covers the most modern tools and resources, methods for overcoming low expression, the cost of producing biopharmaceuticals in microbes, and readily available recombinant protein products.",

            "text": "When considering the engineering of microorganisms for a particular application, perhaps the first strategy that comes to the mind of any researcher is the development of a more efficient expression system. In this sense, heterologous gene expression in prokaryotes [92] and eukaryotes [93] allowed the production of native and recombinant proteins that now are broadly used in medical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological, engineering, food and chemical industries [94,95]. Several characteristics should be considered when aiming the improvement of gene expression to produce an economically viable bioprocess [96,97]. Firstly, the appropriate host strain must be selected based on features such as the ability to sustain fast growth on a cheap media, the ability to be genetically modified and, for some applications, the capability to achieve post-transcriptional modification of enzymes. In the second place, selection between chromosomal or plasmidbased expression systems is also relevant [98]. Additionally, the recombinant protein should be easily extractable in a minimum number of steps. Finally, the strain must be considered as safe for its application to produce a recombinant protein [94,95]. Historically, engineering of microorganisms has focused on the modification of single genes in a very try and error approach [99], but more recently, Synthetic Biology has developed an overriding role in genetic engineering of living organisms [100,101]. Below, we present some useful concepts on the engineering of biological systems and their application in Fungal Synthetic Biology.",

In this context, protein-engineered materials, which span from entirely natural protein-based polymers to hybrid materials comprising inorganic/synthetic materials functionalized with peptides/proteins, capture the best of both worlds (i.e., biofunctionality and customizability) [1,4,5].\n\nBy using genetic engineering methods and recombinant DNA technology, synthetic genes encoding precisely designed amino acid sequences can be constructed and inserted into host organisms able to produce the desired peptides/proteins in a recombinant form [6]. Recombinant proteins can then be purified to be used in key research and/or industrial applications in the areas of biotechnology (e.g., biosensing, biocatalysis and bioremediation) [7,8], biomedicine (e.g., drug delivery, vaccine development and biomedical implants) [9,10] and food [11], textile [12] and paper industry [13]. The advent of this technology made available a wide variety of native-based proteins at a large scale, genetic variants of existing proteins and entirely new proteins engineered with finetuned properties [6].\n\nSeveral prokaryotic (e.g., Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and eukaryotic hosts (e.g., yeast and animals' cells) have been engineered for the production of recombinant proteins, to reduce the complexity of the bioprocess and to improve the product quantity and quality. All have advantages and limitations and therefore should be selected according to the characteristics of the protein to be expressed [6,14]. For instance, in E. coli, purification is more complex because recombinant proteins are mainly produced inside the cells, while in the yeast expression system Pichia pastoris production is typically directed into the extracellular medium, where there are less contaminants [15].

            "text": "In a continuous system cell retention is accomplished via filtration of the product through a membrane, immobilization on a carrier material or by exploiting cellular flocculation [66]. Expression of the heterologous protein causes cell resources to be applied to the transcription and translation of the recombinant protein at the expense of the host cell metabolism. The term metabolic load describes this allocation of resources to heterogenous protein production at the cost of cellular activity to the detriment of the cell, reduced growth capacity and specific growth rate [30]. Furthermore, the effect of metabolic load is greater with larger recombinant gene sizes, copy number, expression levels and issues with nutrient and dissolved oxygen availability [68]. Secretion of the desired protein product greatly simplifies the extraction and purification processes of downstream processing [28]. Protein secretion is initiated by transporting the protein through the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to signals which directly impact the protein yield [11]. Misfolded protein is degraded prior to secretion and may damage the ER, the presence of protein folding chaperones and redox enzymes should be over expressed in yeast systems [11]. Studies describe the production of more than one drug or combination drugs simultaneously in a single batch which offers clear advantages over single biological production [8]. Synthetic biology as recently emerged as a promising field in the area of medical and therapeutic science having application in the production of drugs, vaccines and biosensors [69]. Synthetic biology involves the assembly of a specialized systems designed for a biologic purpose and incorporates engineering into bioprocessing technologies. As expression systems for synthetic biology E. coli and S. cerevisiae are most frequently utilised due to their broad ranging advantages [70]. Synthetic biology allows for enhanced production of biologics via modulation of gene circuits impacting on expression levels, protein levels, and pathway levels of expression systems via engineering of promoters, terminators, etc. [71].",

            "text": "Microbial expression systems have been delivering wide varieties of high-quality recombinant proteins in a scalable and cost-effective manner. While incompatibility between microbial translation machineries and eukaryotic protein architecture presents a serious setback to heterologous protein expression, new discoveries and engineering strategies have been put forward to circumvent the problems. Today, catalogs of highly specialized microbial chassis are available for the functional expression of recombinant proteins with specific structural and biochemical demands (Table 1). Despite the efforts, the complex interplay of cellular physiology and recombinant expression pathways still renders the optimization of protein expression a highly challenging task. Recent advances in the systems-level understanding of cellular expression machineries and the wealth of transcriptomic and proteomic data together present an alternative scheme that could possibly mitigate the bottlenecks in recombinant protein expression. \n\nThe shared perspectives of systems and synthetic biology fostered an emerging idea that cells can be made simpler and more efficient by eliminating components of the genome deemed unnecessary for survival. Indeed, precisely designed genome reductions have consistently led to enhanced cellular features including genomic stability, growth rate, biomass, protein productivity, and genetic pliability (more amenable to genetic engineering) in the target microbial cells. For the most part, an increasing number of existing microbial chassis have been genome-streamlined to resolve some of the bottlenecks in heterologous protein expression and to further optimize their performance. Two opposing approaches exist for the construction of reduced genome strains: top-down genome reduction and bottom-up genome synthesis. Despite the shared goal, the two opposing approaches essentially differ with respect to their area of expertise. While the top-down genome reduction offers a pragmatic approach to further improve the functionality of existing cell factories, the current status of the bottom-up synthesis is more inclined toward understanding the fundamental aspects of the minimal genome. Although it is said that the bottom-up genome synthesis may provide new ground to synthesize non-natural proteins for medicinal use, the underlying cost and time to build one such",

Improving production from cells involves numerous engineering decisions related to the entire organism, including codon optimization, choosing whether or not to export recombinant proteins137, rational or evolutionary methods for improving metabolic yields138, 139, and optimization of growth conditions. Often some or all of the genes required for production are non-optimal for bacterial expression and contain repetitive sequences that are unstable in bacterial hosts. Whole-gene synthesis techniques are increasingly being used to optimize coding sequences for recombinant production136.\n\nThese innovative approaches, as well as more traditional knockout techniques, introduce hard-wired changes into the genomes of interest. However, for many industrial and bioprocess applications, there is a need to dynamically modulate and control the expression of multiple genes, depending upon the state of the bioreactor. These situations would benefit from the development of a synthetic switchboard, one that could tune the expression of many different genes simultaneously and independently. Such a switchboard could be made up of a series of adjustable threshold genetic switches, riboregulators, or riboswitches, and designed to respond to different environmental and intracellular variables, such as pH, light intensity, and the metabolic state of the cell. The switchboard design, which would integrate novel sensory modalities with tunable, interoperable genetic circuits, would have broad functionality for the biotechnology industry. It could be programmed, for example, to shift carbon flux between different pathways depending upon cellular conditions, thereby optimizing the production of biofuels, specialty chemicals, and other materials.",

            "text": "Compatible expression vectors are widely used in synthetic biology, and are of great importance for the efficient co-expression of multiple genes. Synthetic biology is a discipline that integrates the application of science, technology, and engineering to facilitate and accelerate the design, modification, and alteration of genetic material in living organisms. Synthetic biology breaks away from the limits of natural evolution and focuses on \"artificial design and genome editing\" to produce specific target products. In this study, the Duet family of expression vectors was genetically edited using biosynthetic techniques, and plasmids were constructed, designed, and modified. The Duet family of expression vector replicons is mutually compatible and contains different antibiotic markers, allowing the stable co-expression of multiple genes in E. coli [25,27]. The synthesis, assembly, and editing of genetic material such as DNA are of great importance to biosynthetics. Using gene-editing techniques, recombinant plasmids are edited by ligating the target gene to a compatible expression vector. The recombinant plasmids of different copy numbers were then transferred to the same E. coli BL21 (DE3)\u2206nanA to achieve the co-expression of multiple genes. The change from \"discovery\" to \"creation\" opens up new ideas for genetic modification. Many biological functions are not controlled by a single gene, but require the coordinated action of multiple related genes. The use of genetic engineering techniques to co-express multiple genes in the same host bacterium is an effective tool for developmental regulation studies and metabolic pathway modification in E. coli. The target gene is integrated into a compatible expression vector using gene assembly technology. The target gene is cleaved with the same fast cutting enzyme as the vector, and the two are then ligated to create the desired expression vector. Synthetic biology has a wide range of applications in health care. PSA plays an important role in numerous biogenic reactions in living organisms, and is also an ideal material for controlled drug release and scaffolding. The multiple biological effects of PSA make it promising for a wide range of applications in the biomedical field.",

However, efforts have been recently expanded to other hosts including Streptomyces species (Medema et al., 2011), Corynebacterium glutamicum (Becker and Wittmann, 2012), yeast (Krivoruchko et al., 2011;Siddiqui et al., 2012;Furukawa and Hohmann, 2013), and algae (Wang et al., 2012;Gimpel et al., 2013). This expanded landscape seeks to take advantage of the natural capabilities to synthesize precursors and cofactors required to produce a particular target, exploit secretion abilities, or utilize natural tolerance to over-accumulated metabolites (Zhu et al., 2012).

Among these are heterologous expression in bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian cells applying different types of expression vectors. More recently, cell-free translation systems have become available for general use. Today, the two most frequently used systems are based on expression in Escherichia coli and Baculovirusinfected insect cells. Generally, either of these two systems is applicable for expression of almost any soluble protein in quantities acceptable for structural studies. However, concerning membrane proteins the situation is quite different. The yields are substantially lower and the stability of the produced proteins low, which has forced major development activities for expression vectors and systems (Table 1). The main expression systems are briefly described later.",

Promoter engineering is an innovative approach to find out the best promoter system for the expression of recombinant genes, which influences the overproduction of proteins of interest. In this review, some of the bacterial hosts highly used in recombinant protein production were discussed. Next, the importance of promoters in recombinant gene expression, and promoter engineering for enhanced protein production were described.

It is allowed to select a proper strain that accords with expectations from modeling or one that serves as a high-promise candidate relative to others. Breakthrough of these technologies makes the characterization of host strains much easier than before. The integration of promoter engineering promoted the expression level to be more controllable. Due to the safety concern raised by methanol, some novel promoters have been created for developing a methanol-independent expression system. Theoretically, it is allowed to improve the RP production in P. pastoris in methanol-free media through (a) the activation of existing pathway (s), or the generation of new regulatory circuits relying on engineered AOX1/2 promoters, or (b) the design of synthetic new pathways with different transcription factors. \n\nMore deeply understanding the metabolic responses can assist in directing the attempts for strain customization via the genetic engineering for pathway modifications. Before constructing the production process, the investigation of the metabolic engineering of the organism can help to understand the response of cells to the envisioned process. In particular, a genome-scale model can manage all the required information for the improvement of protein secretion in the design of cell factories. As the complete genome sequences are available and systems biology makes advances, genetic manipulation more frequently serves for modifying the certain cellular biochemical reactions to enhance the protein production. Despite this, the newest experimental data and more annotations are needed for a continuous upgrade and validation on the predictive accuracy exhibited by the well-recognized model previously. With the help of mathematical modeling, it would be easier to have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process and optimize key factors which influence the final yield and target productivity of proteins. There is no doubt that P. pastoris has better performance over Escherichia coli, S. cerevisiae, baculovirus/insect cells, SFV or adenovirus/mammalian host cells specific to soluble, secretable protein production. Relative to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression system, it boosts the advantages of (Prielhofer et al., 2013;Gupta and Shukla, 2017): \n\n\u2022 Grow easily and fast to a high cell density in the defined medium;",

Numerous biotechnological advancements, ranging from sophisticated medicines to the biosynthesis of chemical products, have been made because of this form of forward engineering (Ullah et al., 2016). The development and fast analysis of extensive libraries of genetic components by nextgeneration sequencing techniques facilitated the advancement in the research related to the biosynthesis of chemical products. Synthetic cell-to-cell communication, intricate and expansive genomic circuits, and CRISPR-based regulation are noteworthy advancements (Marchand and Collins, 2016). Synthetic biology offers a way to research structure-function interactions among bacteria and create new biotic treatments in the field of microbiota engineering. The ability of the designed microorganism to perceive, record, and react to its immediate environment is expanded by incorporating synthetic genetic components (Bober et al., 2018). Synthetic biology is essential to post-biotic production because it allows for the efficient and sustainable manufacture of useful substances using living organisms or biological components. Furthermore, synthetic biology has made it possible to build biofactories where created cells manufacture medicines like insulin and vaccines, providing more affordable and scalable production techniques (Fang et al., 2020).",

However, several issues in microbial protein expression, including formation of insoluble aggregates, low protein yield, and cell death are still highly recursive and tricky to optimize. These obstacles are usually rooted in the metabolic capacity of the expression host, limitation of cellular translational machineries, or genetic instability. To this end, several microbial strains having precisely designed genomes have been suggested as a way around the recurrent problems in recombinant protein expression. Already, a growing number of prokaryotic chassis strains have been genome-streamlined to attain superior cellular fitness, recombinant protein yield, and stability of the exogenous expression pathways. In this review, we outline challenges associated with heterologous protein expression, some examples of microbial chassis engineered for the production of recombinant proteins, and emerging tools to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins. In particular, we discuss the synthetic biology approaches to design and build and test genome-reduced microbial chassis that carry desirable characteristics for heterologous protein expression.",

Heterologous expression is an effective strategy for overcoming the native host in terms of growth, ease of genetic manipulation, and production yield. \n\nStreptomyces is an attractive heterologous expression host for BGCs and recombinant protein genes because of its functional biosynthetic enzyme expression, substrate availability, secretion systems, and other accessory genes. Rational engineering approaches for the yield improvement of heterologous expression in Streptomyces have been facilitated by the development of genetic tools, chassis construction, and additional genetic engineering strategies, emphasizing further demand for vigorous systems and synthetic biology approaches. Employing the high-throughput DBTL cycle using the \"Streptomyces chassis library\" or \"Streptomyces chassis\" for heterologous expression will open new horizons, expanding the availability and diversity of SMs and recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Recent work has demonstrated the production of antimicrobials and antivirals in yeast. An intriguing example is the production of a monoclonal antibody cocktail active against Ebola virus peptides in P. pastoris [55]. The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak saw a rapid exhaustion in supplies of the ZMapp antibody cocktail, currently produced in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana [85]. A recombinase-mediated landing pad was used for genomic integration of genes encoding all three antibodies (2G4, 4G7 and 13C6) of the ZMapp cocktail [55], a potentially more efficient means of integration considering the low efficiency of homologous recombination in wild-type P. pastoris. The secreted proteins were then shown to bind directly to the Ebola virus, demonstrating that P. pastoris may be used as an alternative to produce antibodies. This synthetic biology platform was suggested to not only provide a reliable means for large-scale production of antibodies, but also to rapidly develop and screen novel forms to combat Ebola resistance [55]. \n\nHumanity faces a significant crisis from the threat of antibiotic resistance [86]. Synthetic biology is uniquely positioned to address this challenge, and will likely contribute to a rich source of new drugs in the year ahead (discussed in further detail in Section 5.1). One important class of antibiotics are the nonribosomal peptides. The first instance of producing the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, penicillin, in S. cerevisiae using synthetic biology methods was recently described [36]. Penicillin productivity was increased by 50-fold using combinatorial pathway optimisation, with the resulting spent growth media displaying activity against Streptococcus bacteria. \n\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provide broad-spectrum protection against parasites, fungi, bacteria and viruses and represent an alternative to the widespread use of antibiotics. However, they are extremely costly to chemically synthesise. E. coli has been used to produce AMPs, but their intrinsic lethality to their hosts necessitates their expression as fusion proteins [87]. A synthetic biology platform was recently developed for the production of the antimicrobial peptide, apidaecin Ia, in P. pastoris [88].",

            "text": "Synthetic biology approaches were applied for the smart design of a genetic switch in E. coli. Lo et al. employed a two-layer genetic controller to regulate bioconversion enzyme expression based on the availability of raw materials and other nutrients. This allowed E. coli to activate the bioconversion process to produce a precursor intermediate, \u03b2-ketoadipic acid, without the need for chemical inducers. As a result, two commodity chemicals, adipic acid and levulinic acid, were synthesized from \u03b2-ketoadipic acid. This approach may see interesting and potential applications in RPP. As well-recognized, the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli commonly leads to the formation of protein aggregates or inclusion bodies (IBs). Singhvi et al. investigated the use of a contemporary freeze-thaw-based solubilization method. This allowed for the recovery of functionally active human growth hormone (hGH) and L-asparaginase from IBs. In general, the freeze-thaw method enabled the solubilisation of hGH aggregates and destabilization of the tetrameric L-asparaginase protein. The purified hGH displayed bioactivity in the improved proliferation of rat lymphoma cells. \n\nThe work by Xu et al. explored Gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio natriegens, as a production host based on the pET expression system. A total of 196 pET plasmids encoding different proteins were transformed into a V. natriegens strain with an integrated T7 RNA polymerase. Twenty constructs showed better soluble expression in V. natriegens than in E. coli. The result indicates that the spectrum of well-expressed proteins in V. natriegens is comparable to that of E. coli. This study suggests that V. natriegens could be a valuable alternative host to E. coli. Finally, Tran et al. investigated the application of the Gram-positive Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 system for the secretion and production of the \u03b1-amylase AmyL from L. plantarum S21.",

            "text": "Microorganisms are at the core of the production of pharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes, and fine chemicals. In many cases, heterologous expression of genes is required to meet commerciallevel demands of target proteins and/or metabolites. In this context, variation in codon usage is considered as one of the major factors affecting protein expression levels, since the presence of rare codons can reduce the translation rate and induce translation errors with a significant impact on the economics of recombinant microbe-based production processes (Ikemura, 1981;Gustafsson et al., 2004). The generation of massive genome sequencing data and cost-effective custom DNA synthesis are foundational technologies for synthetic biology, an emerging discipline that aims to create novel organisms containing designer genetic circuits for the production of drugs, industrial enzymes, biofuels, and chemicals (Endy, 2005;McDaniel and Weiss, 2005;Heinemann and Panke, 2006;Leonard et al., 2008). These circuits are built from standard biological parts, including vectors, promoters, ribosomal binding sites (RBSs), transcriptional terminators, and other gene expression regulatory elements. These parts were initially borrowed from nature and nowadays engineered, to adapt their performance to a particular application, or combined to create sophisticated devices (Shiue and Prather, 2012). \n\nOver the past decade, synthetic biology has contributed to significantly reduce the cost of many products manufactured in microbial systems where only one gene needs to be over-expressed. In many cases, the production of a target protein can be boosted by several orders of magnitude by replacing a native sequence with its optimized counterpart (Gustafsson et al., 2004(Gustafsson et al., , 2012)). This seemingly simple adjustment is of remarkable importance, since many of these products are now traded as commodities and thus there is a continuous need to reduce manufacturing costs in order to remain competitive in the global markets (Menzella, 2011). The ambitious next step of synthetic biology is to further reduce the cost and time involved in developing recombinant organisms by using pre-assembled parts that provide stable, predictable protein expression (Dellomonaco et al., 2010;Nielsen and Keasling, 2011).",

            "text": "Advances in genetic engineering (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) have facilitated the creation and analysis of mutants, offering deep insights into vital functions, such as those of global regulators [121,147]. The field of synthetic biology and the production of protein of interest by heterologous expression should therefore continue advancing biological knowledge while also providing the opportunity for new biotechnological applications with the production of proteins of biotechnological interest. While protein models inform on the putative functions (e.g., substrates and products) and regulatory features of proteins (and, therefore, on the potential differences in the selectivity and specificity between homologous proteins), this should still be validated experimentally, in vitro. Proteins of interest can be isolated from cell extracts using chromatographic methods (Table 1). However, protein isolation can be hindered by the low concentration of certain proteins in cell extracts and/or by the embedding of some proteins in subcellular structures [37,87,91]. Another possibility is to produce proteins of interest using heterologous expression [140]. In recent years, the advances in synthetic biology have facilitated the process of heterologous expression by providing, through automated gene synthesis and molecular biology pipelines, tools for rapid engineering and production of recombinant proteins. Proteins of interest are overexpressed in a host organism, facilitating the extraction and purification of samples suitable for in vitro studies and/or of products for biotechnological applications (e.g., pharmaceuticals). As for proteomics, heterologous expression consists of several steps that can only partly be automated, i.e., host selection, vector design and cloning, transformation of the host, screening of transformants, cultivation of the transformant, heterologous enzyme production, and finally protein recovery and purification. Several hosts can be used for heterologous expression such as Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris) and Escherichia coli [140-142].",

            "text": "The past decade has seen significant advances in synthetic biology, in particular advances in our ability to write DNA and edit genomes (Adli, 2018;Khalil and Collins, 2010). It has never been easier to engineer living systems. Advances in synthetic biology in combination with advances in protein and enzyme engineering, expression and purification and metabolic engineering, have enabled numerous advanced cell factories for the production of proteins as well as metabolites or chemicals (Davy et al., 2017;Dhakal et al., 2019;Keasling, 2010). Among these cell factories, E. coli remains a workhorse microbe for the production of numerous products, including both proteins (including therapeutics) and small molecules (Davy et al., 2017;Hennigan and Lynch, 2022;Kamionka, 2011;Rosano et al., 2019). E. coli is well-studied and has well-developed high cell density culturing techniques, as well as established genome, metabolic and protein engineering tools (Elbing and Brent, 2019;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). \n\nAdvanced tools for genetic manipulation have made it easier to generate a wide diversity of strain designs, necessitating advances in higher throughput methods for testing or evaluating these designs (Leavell et al., 2020). This need has led to the development of numerous \"scale\" down systems to enable strain evaluation or process development at smaller scales in higher throughput (Bareither and Pollard, 2011;Blesken et al., 2016;Fink et al., 2021;Hemmerich et al., 2018;Janzen et al., 2019;Llad\u00f3 Maldonado et al., 2019;Maldonado, 2019;Rameez et al., 2014;Toeroek et al., 2015). While many of these \"microbioreactor\" systems offer significant advances when compared to traditional shake flask or microtiter plate cultivation methods, they are not readily accessible as they can be expensive and require significant adaptation to a given set of microbial strain variants and/or target product.",

The tremendous progress of genetic engineering and the development of powerful molecular techniques has made it possible to develop and apply efficient systems for the production of recombinant proteins in vitro in the laboratory [12]. Their use allows for the efficient production of these peptides, which in natural conditions are present in insufficient amounts. Various protein expression systems are used for the production and purification of recombinant proteins. These include bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems. So far, human recombinant prolidase has been produced mainly in expression systems based on eukaryotic or bacterial cells. Bacterial cultures have been used more often because, as stated, they are not as demanding as the eukaryotic cell culture system and provide better performance in terms of production [13]. Recombinant human prolidase was expressed not only in (i) bacterial cells, e.g., in E. coli [6,9,13], but also in Pichia pastoris [14], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [15], and (ii) Trichoplusiani larvae [8]. There are also known methods of isolating prolidase from isolated mammalian tissues [16][17][18][19][20] and bacterial cells, e.g., Lactobacillus [21]. \n\nThe purpose of the present study has been to develop a highly efficient expression system of recombinant human prolidase and to evaluate the effect of the N-terminal His-Tag on its enzymatic and biological activity.",

Advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology have broadened the horizon of heterologous protein production using multiple expression platforms. Selection of a suitable expression system depends on a variety of factors ranging from the physicochemical properties of the target protein to economic considerations. For more than 40 years, Escherichia coli has been an established organism of choice for protein production. This review aims to provide a stepwise approach for any researcher embarking on the journey of recombinant protein production in E. coli. We present an overview of the challenges associated with heterologous protein expression, fundamental considerations connected to the protein of interest (POI) and designing expression constructs, as well as insights into recently developed technologies that have contributed to this ever-growing field.",

            "text": "It was reported that proteins with large molecular weight or those that harbor several membrane domains pose a far greater tendency to form insoluble aggregates and are prone to proteolysis [10]. Moreover, additional challenges include mimicking eukaryotic post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation) [11], production of harmful endotoxins (E. coli) [12], reduced cell viability resulting from unwanted by-products [13], and low protein yields [14]. To tackle these obstacles, different recombinant DNA technologies, including manipulation of gene expression control [15][16][17], directing proper bond formation and protein folding [18,19], interfering host metabolic pathways [20,21], random or directed evolutions of bacterial strains or enzymes [22], and series of other methods have been systematically employed (summarized in [23]). While these engineering strategies already provide practical solutions for the expression of various protein forms, the engineered expression systems can further be optimized to achieve a better performance. \n\nFunctional protein expression has met a dramatic shift paralleled with the advances in systems and synthetic biology; that is, data-driven understanding in systems biology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework on which to rationally design, build, and test biological entities in an increasingly sophisticated manner [24]. For instance, the following have altogether enabled characterization of the bacterial host and recombinant proteins at the systems level: a large influx of high-throughput information on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites that enabled visualization of the global landscape of transcriptional and translational processes [25,26]; availability of robust computational tools and in silico models streamlining detailed analysis and prediction of the cellular networks; and rapid advances in DNA synthesis, assembly techniques that facilitated the process to build and test the designed biological systems [27,28]. Such new schemes provide one possible way around biological uncertainties; that is, by systematically eliminating genetic redundancies, it is expected to minimize the confounding effects of unknown genetic elements and to reduce metabolic interference from native metabolic pathways while endorsing more predictable regulation of cellular functions [24]. This, in essence, would help to further improve the performance of the extant microbial cell factories.",

The main challenge in the production of recombinant proteins in B. subtilis is that of how to choose a relevant expression system. 8 Different expression systems have already been developed, and proteins from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms have been synthesized and purified. 9 The best strategy depends on the protein to be expressed, though always with the aim of cost reduction, efficiency, and high-yield production. 10 ew strategies include the use of constitutive promoters, double promoters, functional synthetics that are capable of directing transcription, efficient signal peptides, and inducible and self-inducing expression systems. 11,12 hese improved characteristics, together with the growing demand for biotechnology products, contribute to the increase in the use of this bacterium, thus endorsing its widespread use in the field of genetic and metabolic engineering. 13,14 Since the first report of heterologous overproduction of recombinant proteins in this strain, the mass production of an infinity of valuable bioactive molecules has been performed on a relatively large scale. 15 ecognizing the importance of metabolic engineering, systematic biology, synthetic biology, and evolution-based engineering in B. subtilis, this review first summarizes the importance of technical knowledge and the construction of improved strains suitable for industrial production. Next, we present an overview of the B. subtilis secretion system and its crucial role in heterologous protein production. Finally, we review the versatility of the application of promoters and others expression mediators as strategies that aim at production efficiency, also recent advances inductorfree expression vectors construction.",

The capacity to finely manipulate and govern protein biosynthesis holds vast potential for tailored applications. This precision engineering may encompass the optimization of translational machinery, the deliberate design of synthetic riboswitches, and the creation of high-performance expression systems. Advances in genome editing, such as CRISPR/Cas9 and related technologies, will persist in enabling meticulous control over gene expression and protein synthesis [43]. Synthetic biology and the construction of entirely new genetic circuits will facilitate the development of microorganisms designed for specific biotechnological purposes [44]. Furthermore, the evolution of cell-free protein synthesis systems will expedite the controlled production of proteins outside living cells [45]. These advancements promise elevated protein quality, accelerated bioprocessing, and the capacity to craft entirely novel proteins endowed with desired functionalities. Nevertheless, the future of protein biosynthesis research in microorganisms is marked by ongoing challenges and promising trends, from the integration of multi-omics data to the application of artificial intelligence and the rise of precision engineering.

            "text": "Bacterial expression system has been used for production of several recombinant proteins. Two major approaches can be used for enhancing the protein production. The first approach includes such methodologies that deal with optimization of culturing parameters such as pH, temperature, aeration, media formulations, concentration of inducer, use of appropriate strain etc. (Jaliani et al., 2014;Ranjbari et al., 2015;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). On the other hand, second approach utilizes such methodologies that deal at molecular level for improved protein expression. Molecular techniques manipulate certain genetic elements which may increase the protein expression level either at transcriptional or translational level (Makino et al., 2011). Synthetic biology enables us to create and use strong promoters such as T7, trc, etc. that allow us to achieve high expression level by increased transcriptional rate (Tegel et al., 2011). Besides, optimization of translational initiation region and codon optimization has also been utilized to overcome translational difficulties and codon biasness for enhanced protein production in a particular host (Tegel et al., 2011). In addition to that the effect of gene dosage has also been a crucial factor for protein expression level. Gene dosage has been studied in yeast as well as in bacterial expression system. Multiple copies of genes can be inserted in genome of yeast to study the effect of gene dosage for enhanced protein expression (Liu et al., 2020). However, gene dosage in bacterial expression system directly relies on expression vector copy number. Usually, plasmid copy number is increased for increasing the gene dosage in bacteria. This poses additional difficulties in growth and physiology of bacteria. The current study provides an alternate strategy for increasing the gene dosage without altering the copy number of expression vector (Kittleson et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we prepared an expression cassette having T7 promoter, 6X His-tag and gene for human epidermal growth factor in the backbone of pET28a (+) expression vector. The expression cassette was successfully multimerized to prepare the expression vectors with two and three copies of expression cassettes (see Fig. 1).",

            "text": "The conception and design of novel biological systems using bio-molecular components and modules [1e3] is a constructive approach to solve problems, and provide useful solutions for the development of the future bio-economy [4e6]. This is an evolving context where cell-free synthetic biology has emerged as a new bioengineering discipline that aims to reconstitute complex biological functions outside of the living cells seeking applications in medical, environmental, and material science [7e10]. One of the main enabling technologies of this new scientific domain is cellfree protein synthesis [11,12] (CFPS). CFPS is a methodology to synthesize polypeptides and reconstruct molecular machineries (ribosomes) in vitro from synthetic DNA recombinant molecules [13], as well as re-activate complex metabolic pathways in cytoplasmic extracts [14]. Cell-free expression systems can be of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell origin. For instance, depending on the application eukaryotic cell-free expression systems can be prepared from tobacco BY-2, yeast, wheat germ, insect, rabbit reticulocyte, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines [13]. Herein, I will discuss the features and engineering capabilities of the E. coli cell-free expression system, which is the most widely used in synthetic biology. Cell-free expression technology can be more advantageous than in vivo expression of recombinant proteins [15]. At a glance two major advantages should be mentioned: (i) the expression of cytotoxic products, and (ii) rapid prototyping through the design-built-test (DBT) cycle [16]. Nonetheless, CFPS is only one of the possible developments of an emerging scientific field that aims to engineer new complex behaviors and systems in vitro. Some examples of such systems are minimal cells [17], microfluidic based artificial cells [18], in vitro DNA, RNA circuits, and molecular programs [19e22], DNA nanostructure self-assembly [23,24], and cellfree enzyme technology [25].",

One of the emerging applications of synthetic biology is to exploit the link between microorganisms, biologics, and human health. To exploit this link, it is critical to select effective synthetic biology tools for use in appropriate microorganisms that would address unmet needs in human health through the development of new game-changing applications and by complementing existing technological capabilities. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are considered appropriate chassis organisms that can be genetically engineered for therapeutic and industrial applications. Here, we have reviewed comprehensively various synthetic biology techniques for engineering probiotic LAB strains, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated genome editing, homologous recombination, and recombineering. In addition, we also discussed heterologous protein expression systems used in engineering probiotic LAB. By combining computational biology with genetic engineering, there is a lot of potential to develop next-generation synthetic LAB with capabilities to address bottlenecks in industrial scale-up and complex biologics production. Recently, we started working on Lactochassis project where we aim to develop next generation synthetic LAB for biomedical application.",

It is much more plausible that the rapid expansion of promoter engineering [5], accelerated by the developments in the high-throughput screening technologies [31], will provide us with an abundance of bacterial promoters with unique characteristics. As the number of available expression systems is expected to rise continually, it is imperative that promoter selection procedures are expedited and streamlined by further developing enabling bioinformatics tools, expanding existing databases, and adopting a unified method of measuring and quantification of promoter activity. Only then, the key goal of synthetic biology-construction of functional and well-defined biological systems from standardized biological components-can be fully realized.",

            "text": "Gordon et al. opened the door to studying the unusual biology of yeast of the genus Metschnikowia [11]. These yeasts have a genetic code variation in which the leucine CUG codons are instead decoded as serine. The authors developed a new and efficient transformation system for Metschnikowia and an additional 21 yeast species, providing new platforms for genome synthesis and engineering efforts. \n\nProtein expression is an essential methodology for biochemical studies, including those mentioned above, as well as for the production of biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies and therapeutic peptides. Chen et al. [10] used a high-throughput approach to screen for the impact of the expression of any E. coli gene on cell growth. The most significant impact on E. coli growth was observed upon the overexpression of membrane proteins. Interestingly, the authors found that for certain proteins, the use of lower copy number plasmids stabilized cell growth rate and increased overall recombinant protein yields. The impact on cell growth could also often be remedied by amino acid supplementation. Using a related methodology, Schwark et al. used a fluorescent protein reporter system and investigated an E. coli release factor deletion strain with a highly efficient archaeal orthogonal AARS tRNA pair. Their data suggested that the engineered strain will be a highly useful tool for applications requiring the incorporation of multiple ncAAs [5]. \n\nA major ethical responsibility for synthetic biologists is the ability to retain control or confinement of genetically modified microorganisms. This drove the field to develop fascinating and effective methods for containing microorganisms in the lab that are commonly referred to as biocontainment. Some of these approaches included the use of genetic code expansion to create synthetic auxotrophs, such as an E. coli strain dependent on ncAAs for growth [21]. Diwo et al. further extended this idea with their novel formulation of an 'alien genetic code' [12]. The authors presented the concept that an ideal biocontainment system would involve the creation of microbes with genetic codes that are totally incompatible or 'alien' to the natural genetic code.",

To address these issues, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, also known as in vitro protein synthesis, have emerged as a key tool that can work without the use of living cells. These systems allow one to directly control transcription, translation, and metabolism in an open source fashion (Carlson et al., 2012;Lu, 2017;Moore et al., 2017;Jiang et al., 2018;Yue et al., 2019).

Indeed, radically engineered microorganisms can be envisioned that at least partially address different challenges of humankind, including CO 2 pollution (2), plastic degradation and valorization (3), and diagnose and treatment of different diseases (4). To boost the development of this field, genome engineering techniques should be as simple and standardized as possible. This would make microbial engineering accessible to a broader scientific community, and eventually expand the catalogue of editable microorganisms--a key e127 Nucleic Acids Research, 2022, Vol. 50, No. 22 PAGE 2 OF 19 prerequisite to transitioning this discipline from the laboratory to the field (5). \n\nEarly genetic engineering in bacteria mainly was based on transformation of customized DNA constructs (generally plasmids (6), but also linear double-stranded [ds] DNA fragments (7)) containing large regions of homology (200-2000 bp) into recombination-proficient strains. However, native recombination machinery is often inefficient, and only the introduction of an excisable selective marker (often an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by motifs that are recognized by site-specific recombinases, such as Cre (8)) into the customized DNA constructs enables the isolation of edited cells carrying the intended modification. \n\nIn 1998, a new logic for engineering bacterial genomes, called recombineering, was developed (9,10). This technology relies on phage-derived proteins, such as those encoded by the Red operon from phage (9) or RecET from the Rac prophage (10). Both systems code for at least two different protein activities: (i) a 5 to 3 dsDNA exonuclease (Exo (11) and RecE (12)) and (ii) a single-stranded (ss)DNA annealing protein (SSAP) (Beta (13) and RecT (14)).",

The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method. The third is the creation of a completely new biological system and even artificial life after the first two fields have been well developed. By several decades' development of synthetic biology, great progresses in fundamental science and practical applications have been achieved. Furthermore, new breakthroughs will be brought to the biotechnology in the foreseeable future. \n\nSynthetic biology covers various aspects, including genetic circuits, minimal genomes, DNA synthesis, and genetic modification [2]. And also, synthetic biology can be developed in organisms with reverse genetic tools and methodologies, including genetic transformation, selection markers, specific plasmid vectors, different promoters, and other advanced molecular biology techniques, such as (zinc finger proteins) ZFPs, (transcription activators like effector nucleases) TALENs, and (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) CRISPR [3,4]. To provide insight to further understand synthetic biology and discuss future perspectives in this area, the most updated techniques occurring in synthetic biology are summarized in this review.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a highly promising interdisciplinary field aimed at integrating knowledge and techniques from various disciplines to achieve precise control and manipulation of biological systems. Since the discovery of DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, synthetic biology has undergone rapid development. During this time, synthetic biologists have developed numerous tools and technologies to better understand biological systems and to develop new methods for constructing and manipulating these systems. Initially, synthetic biology research was mainly focused on genetic engineering, with the primary goal of inserting artificially synthesized DNA into biological systems to achieve specific functions. However, over time, this field has become increasingly complex, and researchers have begun exploring broader issues, such as how to integrate biological and non-biological systems and how to use these systems for medical and environmental applications. In recent years, synthetic biology research has reached new heights, involving the construction of artificially synthesized genomes and cells, and how to apply these systems to medical, energy, and environmental fields. These research achievements offer enormous potential for treating diseases, reducing pollution, and producing clean energy. In addition, the development of synthetic biology also involves artificial intelligence and machine learning, which can help accelerate the design and construction of biological systems, thus speeding up the progress of synthetic biology. Although synthetic biology still faces many challenges, the development prospects of this field are still very promising with the continuous advancement of technology. This article aims to provide an overview of the development of synthetic biology, including its historical background, early development, technological advances, applications, ethical and social impacts, and future directions, and explore the development process of synthetic biology over the past 60 years.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein products using bacteria hold significant industrial, pharmaceutical, and research values. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host strain for recombinant protein production. It has been successfully used to produce various proteins including collagen peptide [1], cellulose [2], endoglucanase [3], and fucosidase [4]. However, E. coli comes with certain disadvantages, such as a propensity of expressed proteins to aggregate [5,6], its production of endotoxin [7,8], and plasmid instability [9]. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive bacterium, is known for not producing endotoxins with well-characterized genetic properties. It has garnered attention as a reliable workhorse due to its 'generally recognized as safe' (GRAS) status [10]. Over the years, extensive genetic engineering and expression systems have been developed in B. subtilis to produce recombinant proteins [11][12][13]. \n\nIn protein expression systems, two major types of promoters are widely used: inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Several inducible promoters have been developed and employed in B. subtilis, using inducers such as isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [14,15]. However, the cost of inducers can be prohibitive for industrial applications. On the other hand, genes under the control of constitutive promoters can be expressed throughout all growth phases without requiring specific stimuli for expression. \n\nDeveloping a highly efficient expression cassette, including robust promoters, stands out among critical strategies for constructing an expression system. Various studies have been conducted regarding screen promoters, including the use of endogenous promoters [16][17][18][19] such as housekeeping gene promoters [20,21] and the construction of synthetic promoter libraries [22][23][24]. However, these approaches are time-consuming and laborintensive. Notably, most promoters in synthetic promoter libraries often yield suboptimal results [25,26].",

            "text": "Protein engineering is the process of developing polypeptides or proteins by modification of amino acid sequences that are found in nature, and have become a common tool for the development of proteins applied to industry and the clinic [85]. Combining DMF systems with other techniques such as mass spectrometry provides great improvement in protein engineering [86]. Directed evolution has become one of the most common strategies of protein engineering to improve valuable proteins for various bio-industries including bioenergy, biomass-processing and bio-sustainability [87]. Merging DMF systems with directed evolution assays reduces the volume of sample needed from 100 \u00b5L to 6 pL, enabling the analysis of more than 1 \u00d7 10 8 reactions/day compared to the 73,000 reactions per day that can be analyzed with previous technologies [81]. However, success of this approach depends on a diversity of combinational libraries and it requires an efficient method for the high-throughput screening approach for large libraries of variants [88]. DMF technology has the ability to generate uniform droplets and is also suitable for encapsulating single cells or for in vitro expression of single genes within pico to nanoliter water-in-oil droplets [89]. Due to the uniformity and tiny size of droplets, this approach provides quantitative assays in a high-throughput manner and another advantage is the ability for sorting target droplets simultaneous and continuously in real-time. Other groups have presented droplet-based optical polymerase sorting (DrOPS) as a general strategy for expanding the polymerase function by employing an optical sensor to monitor the activity of the polymerase inside the microenvironment of a uniform synthetic compartment generated by microfluidics to engineer natural polymerase to replicate unnatural genetic polymers. Hosokawa and colleagues used agarose gel based DMF technology for the screening of lipolytic enzyme genes from the metagenomic library constructed from soil by E. coli that is transformed with a metagenome [90].",

            "text": "Over 50% of the recombinant proteins registered to date (Protein Data Bank [32]) are of eukaryotic origin, with more than 90% of them being produced in prokaryotic expression systems [32,33]. Among all recombinant expression hosts at work, E. coli is by far the most favored strain, owing to its outstanding genetic tractability, relative ease of cultivation, and innate capacity to accommodate and express exogenous proteins. Specifically, it is the model microbe with the most extensively characterized genome, transcriptome and translatome architectures, and underlying regulations [25,34]. In addition, the availability of a vast repertoire of synthetic biology tools such as libraries of promoters, ribosome-binding sites (RBS) and 5 -untranslated regions (5 -UTRs), expression vectors, and synthetic circuits effectively streamline its genetic manipulation [35][36][37][38][39]. In aspects of protein productivity, E. coli was reported to dedicate nearly 40% of its dry cell weight entirely for recombinant protein in fed-batch culture conditions [40], and are able to functionally express a wide spectrum of non-glycosylated proteins. Such inherent features of E. coli have much been exploited in the industry for mass-production of many commodity proteins [41]. \n\nEven so, securing high-purity, high-yield recombinant proteins, especially those of eukaryotic origin, has remained challenging in E. coli due to constraints inherent to cellular physiology and translational regulations. For instance, just as many prokaryotic expression systems, E. coli lacks post-translational modification machineries required for functional expression of proteins in eukaryotic origins, such as glycosylation [11]. This could present a serious drawback in prokaryote-based expression systems, considering that more than 50% of eukaryotic proteins are predicted to be glycosylated [42]. Other classes of post-translational modifications highly prevalent across eukaryotic proteins include phosphorylation and acetylation [43].",

            "text": "Recent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype. The design, use, and importation of constructed genetic control elements, optimized genes, and functional genetic circuits can be used to modulate the function of metabolic pathways. The modularity and hierarchy of parts, devices, systems, and chassis provide a framework for studying and controlling cellular functions. Moreover, synthetic biology provides an interface where protein engineering, directed evolution, DNA synthesis, and in silico design can direct the field of metabolic engineering. Many of these advances are influencing how scientists and engineers view and perturb cellular systems. Perhaps the paramount application of these tools is in the arena of microbial biotechnology where the overarching goal is to rewire cellular systems for biochemical production. This task is quite complex given the complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism and regulation. Synthetic biology approaches provide a way to both intervene in as well as bypass cellular complexities. \n\nThis special issue contains six review articles that highlight two major aspects of synthetic biology: (1) general design principles and modeling of synthetic biology and (2) applications of synthetic biology to biochemical and biofuels production. The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n\nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n\nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \"biology by design\" paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired.",

These ubiquitous microorganisms play an essential role in deciphering complex gene regulation mechanisms, large-scale recombinant protein production, and lately the two emerging areas of biotechnology\u2014synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Among a myriad of factors affecting prokaryotic gene expression, judicious choice of promoter remains one of the most challenging and impactful decisions in many biological experiments. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of bacterial promoter engineering, with an emphasis on its applications in heterologous protein production, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. In addition to highlighting relevant advances in these fields, the article facilitates the selection of an appropriate promoter by providing pertinent guidelines and explores the development of complementary databases, bioinformatics tools and promoter standardization procedures. The review ends by providing a quick overview of other emerging technologies and future prospects of this vital research area.",

            "text": "Biological timers of this sort have been developed using genetic toggle switches that were deliberately rendered imbalanced through model-guided promoter engineering 112 . These genetic timers were used to program the time-dependent flocculation of yeast cells to facilitate the separation of cells from, for instance, the alcohol produced in industrial fermentation processes. \n\nSynthetic control systems can also be used to extract and purify the synthesized product. This is particularly important in the production of recombinant proteins, bioplastics and other large biomaterials, which can accumulate inside cells, cause the formation of inclusion bodies and become toxic to cells if they are present at high titres. To export recombinant spider-silk monomers, Widmaier et al. 115 searched for a secretion system that would enable efficient and indiscriminate secretion of proteins through both bacterial membranes. The Salmonella type III secretion system (T3SS) not only fulfils these criteria but also possesses a natural regulatory scheme that ties expression of the protein to be secreted to the secretion capacity of the cell; as a result, the desired protein is only expressed when sufficient secretion complexes have been built. To obtain superior secretion rates of recombinant silk protein, the researchers needed only to engineer a control circuit that hitches the heterologous silk-protein-producing genes to the innate genetic machinery for environmental sensing and secretion commitment. \n\nFinally, there is an emerging branch of synthetic biology that seeks to program coordinated behaviour in populations of cells, which could lead to the fabrication of novel biomaterials for various applications. The engineering of synthetic multicellular systems is typically achieved with cell-cell communication and associated intracellular signal processing modules, as was elegantly used by Hasty and colleagues 23 to bring about synchronized oscillations in a population of bacterial cells. Weiss and colleagues 24,31 have similarly done pioneering work in building biomolecular signalprocessing architectures that can filter communication signals originating from 'sender' cells. These systems, which can be programmed to form intricate multicellular patterns from a solid-phase cellular lawn, would aid the development of fabrication-free scaffolds for tissue engineering.",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

            "text": "The development of targeted genome editing technologies has opened new prospects for the generation of transgenic animals at a whole new level. The standardization of the generation of transgenic animals with specified and stable target traits is becoming possible thanks to the use of knowledge on the molecular genetic mechanisms of regulation of gene expression and genome functioning, as well as the available technologies of genetic engineering. That is fully applicable to the production of recombinant proteins in milk for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, biologically active additives, etc. \n\nTaking into account the set of technologies generated to date, which are still under active development, the optimal direction of studies in the field of recombinant protein production in the milk of economically important animals points to the creation of animal lines (depending on the need in a target protein -rabbits, sheep, goats, and cows) whose genome is modified by the insertion of sequences for asymmetric directed recombination of the expression cassette into a milk protein-encoding gene (e.g., the \u03b2-casein gene). The promoter, and other regulatory sequences, of this gene will provide a high level of transgene expression. This insertion can be achieved with high efficiency through a microinjection into the oocytes of a genetic construct carrying an expression cassette, together with the corresponding recombinant integrase or its mRNA. These animal lines can be created with previously inaccessible efficiency by means of genome editing technologies us-REVIEWS ing the CRISPR/Cas9 system or its analogues, thanks to the simplicity of implementation and design of this system. At the same time, the technologies of synthetic biology allow one to use mini-genes with artificial introns as a transgene, but not full-length gene copies, to facilitate efficient expression of the transgene and production of the target protein, thus simplifying the design and creation of genetic constructs for transgenesis. \n\nProspects for the development of such a direction in the production of recombinant proteins, primarily for medical needs, are supported by the two marketed drugs that are based on recombinant proteins obtained from the milk of transgenic animals. It should be noted that there is the possibility of producing significant quantities of recombinant proteins at costs substantially lower than those required for production in cellular systems.",

This aspect is being explored in the industry to create cell factories that cause the efficient production of fuels and chemicals [10]. \n\nSynthetic biology progresses to write new genetic information, creating designed nonnatural genes, proteins, and biological processes in the organism [11]. Synthetic biology cannot work in isolation. It needs to be coupled with metabolic engineering and systems biology. After designing the synthetic pathway, the metabolite flux is maintained to allow an economically feasible process. The genotype-phenotype interaction also needs to be looked upon [10]. The ideologies remain a bit obstructed because of the constraints due to the pressure of a higher number of introns and the large size of some genes. \n\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technologies can overcome it all [12]. \n\nThe present review attempts to give a comprehensive account of the alternatives to non-renewable energy sources, mainly because of the growing demand coupled with the scarcity of fossil fuels.

            "text": "Nowadays, the genetic engineering of individual species or the entire metagenome based gene insertion, protein engineering, or plasmid/ virus augmentation remains restricted to laboratory scale due to their lack efficiency, and increasing environmental safety concern. The conventional genetic engineering tools were out spaced with recent advancements in genome editing and synthetic biology. Various genome editing tools like the CRISPR, TALEN, and ZFN enable the programmable modification of microbial genomes [114]. Other than deletion or gene insertion, these tools can be utilized for the overexpression or repression of certain genes [115]. The gene regulation by deactivated Cas (dCas) also improves environmental tolerance in the microbial species [116]. Genome editing also helps to customize microbes for the biosynthesis of novel enzymes and secondary metabolites [117]; thus, engineered microbes become the superior target as probiotics. The new approaches are heading for the biological designing or modeling of microbes in the whole genome-scale to obtain desirable phenotype. Accordingly, the introgression of synthetic regulatory gene circuits in living cells is required for broad-spectrum applications [118]. The combination of system biology and genome editing, along with sophisticated bioinformatics tools, may open up new avenues to solve the plastic problem. \n\nMoreover, the application of cell-free methods for protein-expression is another convenient way to produce enzyme and their broad-spectrum application [119]. The expansion of metagenomic techniques not only helps to identify novel genes and their functional analysis through heterologous expression but also reach up to the development of proteins with improved characteristic with the aim of tailormade solutions for specific problems. In these ways, metagenomics offers the extraction of more valuable information about the microbial world, and their biotechnological employment to resolve various social and environmental problems would be prioritized in the frontier of research.",

The nature of the target proteins themselves, along with cost, ease of use, and speed, are typically cited as major factors to consider in production. Despite a wide variety of alternative expression systems, most recombinant proteins for research and therapeutics are produced in a limited number of systems: Escherichia coli , yeast, insect cells, and the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and CHO. Recent interest in Vibrio natriegens as a new bacterial recombinant protein expression host is due in part to its short doubling time of \u2264\u200910\u00a0min but also stems from the promise of compatibility with techniques and genetic systems developed for E. coli . We successfully incorporated V. natriegens as an additional bacterial expression system for recombinant protein production and report improvements to published protocols as well as new protocols that expand the versatility of the system. While not all proteins benefit from production in V. natriegens , we successfully produced several proteins that were difficult or impossible to produce in E. coli . We also show that in some cases, the increased yield is due to higher levels of properly folded protein. Additionally, we were able to adapt our enhanced isotope incorporation methods for use with V. natriegens . Taken together, these observations and improvements allowed production of proteins for structural biology, biochemistry, assay development, and structure-based drug design in V. natriegens that were impossible and/or unaffordable to produce in E. coli . Production of proteins with reduced aggregation compared to E. coli . Optimized protocols for efficiency and protein expression. Improved yield for specific proteins compared to E. coli .",

            "text": "Lysate systems contain essentially all cytoplasmic components, which is advantageous for recapitulating cellular processes. However, this makes their composition ill-defined, leading to challenges in basic science and engineering. To address these difficulties, efforts were made to generate fully recombinant cell-free systems from a small number of purified enzyme components, whose composition can be defined exactly. Such defined systems are especially important for bottom-up synthetic biology for three main reasons. The first is that their use supports research into minimal cellular systems, as \"minimality\" of components and pathways can be directly tested. Secondly, the composition of the recombinant system is known much more precisely than for extract-based systems. This property is highly beneficial for modeling, optimization, troubleshooting, and mechanistic understanding of engineered pathways. Thirdly, the use of recombinant cell-free systems presents a viable approach toward the development of de-novo constructed synthetic cells.\n\nAlmost half a century ago, Weissbach's group developed the first such systems from recombinant E. coli proteins (Kung et al., 1977), but observed very low protein yield. About 25 years later, thanks to the advent of His-tag purification as well as the addition of a creatine-phosphate-based energy regeneration system, Shimizu et al. (2001) developed a very similar system called PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) but with markedly higher protein synthesis yield (Figures 2A,B). Currently, there are three commercially available versions of this system: PUREfrex 2.0 (GeneFrontier), PURExpress (NEB)  The four major reactions, aminoacylation, transcription, translation, and energy regeneration occurring during cell-free protein synthesis in the PURE system are shown along with a list of the components involved. (C) Optimization of the system can be carried out by adjusting both protein and energy solution components. Potential system modifications are shown: (D) supplementation with E. coli RNAP allows for more complex transcription regulation (Maddalena et al., 2016); (E) addition of chaperones aids protein folding (Niwa et al., 2012); (F) vesicles enable membrane protein folding and assembly (Kuruma and Ueda, 2015;",

            "text": "The recombinant DNA technology, born in early 1970 ties, has nowadays become mature and highly sophisticated. It plays an indispensable role in medicine, industry, and scientific research. Its rapid proliferation into a wide variety of techniques and molecular solutions for genetic engineering is largely owed to its historically first and still dominating recombinant DNA \"vehicle\" -E. coli. These bacteria were used for the construction of the most robust genetic expression systems, such as those based on: T7-lac hybrid promoter, bacteriophage lambda pL and pR promoters or arabinose operon promoter. Other advantages of the systems include fast bacterial growth, cost-effectiveness and deep understanding of the molecular basis of recombinant proteins biosynthesis, as E. coli is the most thoroughly studied microorganism. Bioactive molecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins, designed de novo, are being utilized in increasingly diverse scientific, biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. The rapidly developing synthetic biology generates growing demands for synthetic genes of various types, from native to those with a highly modified sequence. The capability of generating DNA molecules of any sequence or size is especially important in biomedical research.\n\nDNA sequences of the designed, synthetic genes may require long repetitive DNA fragments. However, the chemical synthesis of such fragments still poses a great challenge. Thus, there is a current need for the development of new technologies, enabling modular construction of complex synthetic genes.\n\nVast majority of synthetic recombinant DNA constructs are intended for recombinant protein production. Besides the need for recombinant proteins, the protein fragments, polypeptides, functional domains, protein-derived or natural peptides are being increasingly used, not only for functional studies but also in a wide variety of applied sciences, like material engineering and medicine. The intensive research on peptide-based biomaterials as biologically active tools has resulted in the development of a wide range of peptides and polypeptides with extended functionalities. Both natural and engineered versions of the bioactive peptides have found applications in the construction of biosensors, drug-delivery systems, and medicine [1][2][3][4].\n\nTo allow detailed investigation and scaled-up production of new macromolecular biomaterials (built from the repetitive DNA, RNA,",

Two review articles included in this special issue summarized the recent progresses on technological developments to improve the stress tolerance of microorganisms [12] and engineering of pathways and genomes [13], respectively. Base editing technology has opened a new avenue for genome engineering, however it still suffers from limited availability of editable sites in the target bacterial genome. Chen et al. developed a broad-spectrum DNase-inactive Cpf1 (dCpf1) variant from Francisella novicida through directed evolution, which enabled specific C to T mutations at multiple target sites in the E. coli genome without compromising cell growth [14]. Construction and balancing of biosynthetic pathways require expression of multiple genes, which is normally realized by different promoters with various strengths.

For engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ambrosio et al. designed and characterized 41 synthetic guide RNA sequences to expand the CRISPR-based genome engineering capabilities, and characterize in high temporal resolution 20 native promoters and 18 terminators [16]. As mentioned above, engineering of methyltrophic yeast can help to establish methanol biotransformation process for chemical biosynthesis, but the complex regulation of methanol metabolism hinders rational engineering. Hou et al. carried out comparative proteomics analysis of Pichia pastoris cultivated in glucose and methanol, which identified several genes that play important roles in methanol utilization [17].",

            "text": "Biotechnology is poised to bring disruptive innovation across many industries, from energy to healthcare. The size of the industry is estimated to reach $30 trillion by 2030 and could account for more than a third of the global output of manufacturing industries (Candelon et al., 2022 ). Microbial biomanufacturing of chemicals, materials, and biomolecules promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve land use, and bolster sustainability by replacing the products derived from petroleum and ingredients sourced from animals or wild-harvested plants with sustainable alternatives made from renewable feedstocks (Fig. 1 a) (Scown & Keasling, 2022 ). However, doing so requires developing efficient and robust industrial strains capable of producing a wide range of products, from small molecules to proteins, at competitive prices. \n\nCurrently, the majority of commercialized bio-based products are high-value molecules, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), flavors and fragrances, and specialty chemicals supporting relatively small markets. At the same time, most of the opportunity remains untapped primarily due to the inability of biomanufacturing routes to compete with the price points established by the existing production methods. Reaching those profit margins requires extreme strain performance, which is difficult to achieve with traditional strain development approaches (Fig. 1 b). In order to capture the market opportunities across all sectors of the bioeconomy, we need to improve the efficiency of the strain engineering process to reduce development costs and time to market. \n\nOur ability to engineer biological systems has improved dramatically thanks to technological advances in genome engineering and interrogation tools over the last several decades. DNA sequencing, synthesis, and assembly technologies, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genome editing, and other synthetic biology tools have greatly accelerated and elevated the strain engineering process. However, alongside the progress in manipulating genomes came the full appreciation that biology is incredibly complex and not as easy to engineer as man-made modular systems. A landmark publication titled \"Five hard truths for synthetic biology\" details the obstacles that stand in the way of fully utilizing synthetic biology to predictably engineer biological systems (Kwok, 2010 ).",

Over the past decade, knowledge of the biosynthesis of bacterial polymers together with systems biology and synthetic biology has revolutionized the rational engineering of cell factories, which has increased production yields and/or led to production of innovative biobased materials (Fig. 5). As mentioned earlier, bio synthesis of bacterial polymers requires the engagement of complex cellular processes from gene expression to provision of enzymes and proteins, central metabolism, and regulatory and signalling systems leading to intra cellular assembly or secretion across the cell envelope. Hence, design of cell factories for production of novel biopolymers requires integration of the complexity of cellular and metabolic process and extensive experimen tation to combine the relevant genetic information. DNA foundries use advanced software, robotic and analyti cal approaches to allow automated 'design-build-test' engineering cycles for the highthroughput development of desired cell factories through synthetic assembly of genetic elements. DNA foundries have higher experi mental consistency and lower costs than manual oper ations. Furthermore, modular genetic elements, such as promoters, terminators, ribosomebinding sites, orthog onal polymerases, untranslated regions, signal peptides, putative stabilization modules, genetic effectors and protein folding enhancers, provide a dynamic plat form to tune gene expression and protein production. \n\nStriking advancements include the introduction of inducible and/or controllable genetic switches, such as T7 polymerasebased expression systems 121 , pro grammable T7based synthetic transcription fac tors 122 , the riboTite system 123 , vector engineering 124 and CriSPr-Cas 125 tools, to allowed finetuned expression of endogenous or heterologous genes.

The natural outcome of such an advance is synthetic biology, which deals with the design and assembly of predictable and robust biological parts/systems and systems biology, which aims at system-level understanding of biological systems. These well-characterized and novel biological parts/systems would in turn provide useful drugs, green fuels, or other high value biomaterials [1,2]. Synthetic biologists differ from genetic engineers in that they try to engineer and create complex biological systems for practical applications from lesser understood and unreliable basic components [3]. Systems biologists develop tools of modeling, simulation, and comparison to experiment in order to understand complex biological systems. The systems biology approach will be especially useful in synthetic biology. Challenges associated with the progress in synthetic biology and systems biology will be the focus of this review. \n\nThe two main challenges that limit the progress of synthetic biology are the complexity of the biological systems and the physical variations in biological behavior. These limitations lead to an uncertain probability of success of the engineered biological systems and an inability to fully predict even a simple component [3,4]. Despite several advances in synthetic biology, engineering biological systems is still an expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable process [4]. The response of a biological system is usually nonlinear in that even a simple pathway in a well-studied microorganism cannot be explained satisfactorily. The task of creating an artificial biological system is made more complex with the increase in the complexity of the novel genetic circuits. \n\nUnlike other electrical systems in which interactions between individual components are well characterized and the components operate independently, with the biological components, one cannot avoid undesirable crosstalk due to nonspecific interactions with other components in the cell. Understanding the overall behavior of the natural system is a prerequisite for the successful design of a synthetic biological system. High-throughput experimental methods are necessary to understand the complexity associated with biological systems [5]. Automated, multiplex, and parallel reactions are mandatory in order to gain a deeper insight into the complex biological systems.",

We also provide a plasmid cassette system (and individual parts) for inducible T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) production and purification (Figure S6). We validate T7 RNAP activity using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). We have also made two improvements to the MoClo system, first by simplifying the storage plasmid for open reading frames (ORFs), and second we introduce a secondly site to offer flexibility in pathway design. For example, three TUs can be placed in the secondary module under constant expression, while the primary site can be used to assemble and optimize a specific gene, regulatory cascade or biosynthetic pathway. \n\nIn synthetic biology, there is an increasing need to provide a repertoire of biological parts (promoters, RBS, terminators) characterized in the context of the chosen DNA assembly technique. For example, DNA parts can behave differently when placed in a different context (known as \"context dependency\"), which directly challenges the engineering dogma surrounding synthetic biology. \u221219 To understand such effects in our EcoFlex kit, we have validated our library of biological parts both in vivo and in vitro (in cell-free reactions). To demonstrate the broad utility of EcoFlex, we also provide exemplars of rapidly assembling and purifying His 6 -tagged proteins, rational library design using flow cytometry and the optimization of the violacein biosynthetic pathway using a secondary MoClo module to simplify pathway design and increase the frequency of successful library assemblies. \n\nE. coli is one of the major workhorses in synthetic biology, providing a very well-studied chassis for the manipulation of genetic circuits and implementation of biosynthetic pathways.",

These approaches emphasize the applicability of synthetic biology and protein engineering to create improved functional ribosomal biomaterials. \n\nThe vast design space provided by synthetic biology is not limited to the materials that currently exist. For example, new hybrid biomaterials can be produced by combining the biosynthesis of two or more structural biomaterials. In addition, new host organisms with unique biosynthetic capabilities can be domesticated to produce new biomaterials. In addition, genetically encoded logic can be used to control biosynthesis, possibly for structuring and forming complex biomaterials. In the next section, we describe recent advances in creating new structural biomaterials using synthetic biology and highlight the potential of new host organisms and programmable logic to further influence the creation of new bio-derived structural materials [29]. \n\nSynthetic biology allows you to synthesize new materials that mimic natural fabrics and materials that have no analogues. One of the first examples is the use of metabolic engineering to synthesize new cellulose-chitin heteropolysaccharides in bacteria. In addition, the desired properties in new materials can be achieved by abstracting functional domains from existing biomaterials and improving or combining them with other domains [30]. \n\nSilk-elastin-like protein copolymers have been developed that use both the mechanical strength of silk and the heat-sensitive properties of elastin.",

It is a powerful platform that helps in developing studies in the field of synthetic biology, such as approaches to metabolic engineering that characterize novel enzymes and biosynthetic pathways for biochemical descriptions of novel enzymes in addition to promising models of biosynthetic pathways. 7 ll this can be achieved because of the main advantage of this system, namely, the absence of a cell wall, which allows rapid and direct access to control and manipulate the reaction by direct addition of DNA, thus avoiding arduous cloning and transformation phases. In this case, incubation for only a few hours is needed to test genetic constructs and to have protein expression without purification steps. \n\nTo date, the most well studied types of cell-free systems are focused on the platforms of Escherichia coli, 8 wheat germ, 9 yeast, 10 and mammalian cells, 11 all of which have been extensively described and optimized with new methodologies and preparations that have been thoroughly established and validated over time. The most highly developed tool to date is the prokaryotic cell-free system based on E. coli, 12,13 for which two commercial kits are available with promising results for natural product biosynthesis: (a) TX-TL based on a crude cell lysate 14 and (b) the Protein Synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE) system created from purified proteins (enzymes, ribosomes, and translation factors), which some authors have described as the next-generation cell-free protein system. 15",

Due to the great development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to complicated refactoring efforts [2][3][4] that can produce medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxadiene, etc.) [5,6] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc.) [7,8] in a high titer. \n\nAmong many systems available for heterologous protein production, the Gram-negative bacterium Open Access *Correspondence: 87062@cau.edu.cn 1 State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Ministry of Agriculture Feed Industry Centre, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Escherichia coli remains one of the most attractive organisms because of its ability to grow rapidly and at high density on inexpensive substrates. Well-characterized genetics and availability of a large number of cloning vectors and mutant host strains [9]. As a commonly used organism for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways, E. coli has been the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [10,11]. E. coli is a facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating bacterium that is considered as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of bio-fuels and biochemicals [12]. Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of transcription, translation and protein folding in E. coli, together with developments of improved genetic tools have made E. coli more valuable than ever [9].",

            "text": "Global demand for recombinant proteins has steadily accelerated for the last 20 years. These recombinant proteins have a wide range of important applications, including vaccines and therapeutics for human and animal health, industrial enzymes, new materials and components of novel nano\u2010particles for various applications. The majority of recombinant proteins are produced by traditional biological \u201cfactories,\u201d that is, predominantly mammalian and microbial cell cultures along with yeast and insect cells. However, these traditional technologies cannot satisfy the increasing market demand due to prohibitive capital investment requirements. During the last two decades, plants have been under intensive investigation to provide an alternative system for cost\u2010effective, highly scalable, and safe production of recombinant proteins. Although the genetic engineering of plant viral vectors for heterologous gene expression can be dated back to the early 1980s, recent understanding of plant virology and technical progress in molecular biology have allowed for significant improvements and fine tuning of these vectors. These breakthroughs enable the flourishing of a variety of new viral\u2010based expression systems and their wide application by academic and industry groups. In this review, we describe the principal plant viral\u2010based production strategies and the latest plant viral expression systems, with a particular focus on the variety of proteins produced and their applications. We will summarize the recent progress in the downstream processing of plant materials for efficient extraction and purification of recombinant proteins. J. Cell.

            "text": "Since the first functional recombinant protein was expressed in 1977 (Itakura et al., 1977), bacteria have been the most widely used system for heterologous expression of proteins. Consequently, over time, a whole plethora of tools have been developed to improve bacteria for protein expression in both small and large scales.\n\nThe domain Bacteria comprises a vast number of physiologically and metabolically well-characterized organisms. Fundamental research on bacterial physiology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework to rationally design processes in a sophisticated manner (Carr and Church, 2009;Choe et al., 2016). The acquired knowledge has led to a collection of genetically engineered bacterial chassis for heterologous toxin expression. Among all bacterial hosts used for recombinant protein production, Escherichia coli is the most widely utilized. E. coli adapts to a large range of physical and chemical culture conditions while accumulating recombinant proteins up to 80% of its dry weight. Using E. coli, it is possible to express proteins that are safe to administer as biotherapeutics, with efficient methods to remove endotoxins in place (Mamat et al., 2015;Schneier et al., 2020). Even though bacterial systems possess considerable advantages, the main challenge in producing toxins from eukaryotic organisms in bacteria is the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the incorporation of PTMs that prokaryotic systems cannot introduce. Nevertheless, many genetic tools and techniques exist for expressing recombinant proteins, such as optimized bacterial strains, co-expression with chaperones or foldases, and the use of various promoters for tightly regulated expression ( Figure 3).\n\nAnimal toxins have been recombinantly expressed in microbial systems since the early 1990s (Boyot et al., 1990;Fiordalisi et al., 1991;Park et al., 1991;Dudler et al., 1992;Kelley et al., 1992). To date, bacterial expression still remains the preferred system for the heterologous expression of toxins, especially for small and cysteine-less toxins like actinoporins from sea anemones (Alegre-Cebollada et al., 2007). Bacterial expression has been successfully used",

Synthetic biology builds on existing technologies by standardising the genetic parts required to form transcriptional units and operons, and allows facile generation of libraries in vitro and subsequent screening for desirable phenotypes. Prior to this, biological approaches have been slow and complex, with non-standardised with incompatible parts between different methods. A number of singular and overlapping toolkits have therefore been developed for the genetic engineering of a wide variety of industrially important organisms (Table 1). These toolkits span a variety of different functions from simple expression of heterologous proteins in model systems, to improvement of the genetic capabilities of non-model organisms by way of replicating plasmids and antibiotic resistances. Currently there are limited examples of their use in the role of biological remediation and the detection of metals, as many of the toolkits are relatively new. The exception to this is that of the more established BioBrick system, for which there are examples of its implementation for the bioremediation of gold [25], cobalt and nickel [26], mercury [27] and the detection of arsenic, mercury and copper [28].",

            "text": "For example, microorganisms like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, capable of surviving in the human gut for extended periods, can be reprogrammed for the long-term monitoring and treatment of chronic diseases. Thus, synthetic biology is emerging as a powerful approach for reengineering microorganisms for pharmaceutical applications [68]. \n\nSynthetic biology has introduced a transformative shift in drug production by engineering microbes for efficient biosynthesis. For example, Jay Keasling and his colleagues [69] successfully modified Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae microorganisms to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor to the antimalarial drug artemisinin. By optimizing biosynthetic pathways and balancing metabolic processes, the researchers developed economically viable alternatives to plant-derived artemisinin, clearly demonstrating the transformative potential of synthetic biology in pharmaceutical production [70]. \n\nSynthetic biology has significantly improved the efficiency of pharmaceutical production by optimizing microbial systems for the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. Rojo and colleagues [71] highlighted the advantages of engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae microorganisms over traditional plant-based systems, demonstrating their ability to achieve higher yields and save time in addressing challenges in the production of compounds such as pterocarpans and coumestans. This study emphasized the potential of microbial engineering to overcome limitations inherent to plant-based systems, such as low yields and lengthy production cycles. \n\nBy employing synthetic genetic circuits, bacteria can be adapted to detect and respond to specific pathogens. For example, genetically modified E. coli bacteria act with high precision through engineered bacteriocins that inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These methods not only address the issue of antibiotic resistance but also improve the efficiency and accuracy of microbial systems [72]. The advancements in synthetic biology have also provided significant momentum for engineering probiotics and other members of the human microbiome for biomedical applications [73]. Modified microorganisms are being developed as biodiagnostic and therapeutic tools to address health challenges such as treating gastrointestinal disorders and regulating the immune system.",

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technologies and the ability to transform microbial organisms with synthetic DNA has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry (Walsh 2014). As a first demonstration, plasmid DNA encoding insulin chain A and B was introduced into Escherichia coli and shown to be capable of using the bacterial machinery to produce recombinant insulin for use in patients, albeit at poor yield (Johnson 1983). Since that time, many expression platforms have been developed to harness the unique characteristics of each protein. In instances where post-translational modifications are required, the expression systems of choice are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insect cells, or the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris (Ahmad et al. 2014;Kim et al. 2012;Vrljic et al. 2011). When relatively large quantities of simple proteins lacking post-translational modifications are required, E. coli is the system of choice (Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). Since their introduction, each expression system has been examined in detail to determine which factors facilitate protein folding and also to identify the rate-limiting steps of protein production (Sato and Inaba 2012). Once identified, it has been possible to modify the host organism or growth parameters to overcome these rate-limiting steps in order to increase recombinant protein accumulation (Lilie et al. 1994;Sato and Inaba 2012;Horwich et al. 1999). \n\nRecently, eukaryotic green microalgae have been explored as a potential protein production platform. Algae offer attractive production features, including photosynthetic growth (Franklin and Mayfield 2004), ease of genetic manipulations (Grossman 2000), and unique biochemical compartments (Tran et al. 2009). These features allow green algae to produce complex heterologous proteins at a fraction of the cost of traditional protein expression platforms (Franklin and Mayfield 2004). Additionally, many green algae are edible, opening up the possibility of orally delivering bioactive proteins and removing cumbersome and costly downstream purifications associated with other expression systems (Barrera et al. 2014;Gregory et al. 2012).",

            "text": "The E. coli extract-based cell-free expression system is the most popular, and it has significantly improved during the last few years. Two main advantages of this system are that there is no need to support cellular metabolism and that the reaction environment can be controlled, making it possible to add any necessary component into the reaction mixture to reach the optima protein production conditions. \n\nThe aggregation of recombinant proteins in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs) is also a major issue associated with recombinant production processes. Some proteins show a low solubility and are mainly produced in their aggregated version. In consequence, many solubilization strategies and a wide number of refolding parameters have been described for the isolation of soluble proteins from IBs [21]. Due to the extent of IB characterization in the last two decades, showing that IBs are protein aggregates formed (at least partially) by correctly folded and fully active recombinant proteins [22], non-denaturing solubilization protocols have been recently developed [23,24]. \n\nFinally, emerging tools are also being used to optimize the expression of recombinant proteins. The use of high-throughput technologies allows the reshaping and optimization of traditional production processes in a fast and efficient way. This includes cultivation platforms, detection methods, and screening systems [25]. In addition, the use of synthetic biology to design and build genome-reduced bacteria is an interesting technology to design bacteria with a minimal genome removing the unnecessary proportions of genome which can improve cellular capacity, and, consequently, increase heterologous protein expression [26].",

            "text": "Ultimately, the synthetic biology approach is geared toward the rational engineering or repurposing of biological parts, devices and systems into solutions that can help address societal challenges (Ausl\u00e4nder et al., 2017). Synthetic biologists envision a broad application space for the field and anticipate positive societal impacts in medical technologies (Pardee, 2018;Hicks et al., 2020) (e.g., biosensors and therapeutics), food security and sustainable energy (Russo et al., 2019;Roell and Zurbriggen, 2020) (e.g., biofuels and synthetic photosynthesis), bioremediation (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k et al., 2017;Wan et al., 2019) (e.g., pollution monitoring and sequestration), education (Kelwick et al., 2015a;Huang et al., 2018;Dy et al., 2019) (e.g., iGEM competition) and biomanufacturing (Le Feuvre and Scrutton, 2018;Choi K.R. et al., 2019;Gilbert and Ellis, 2019;Roberts et al., 2019) (e.g., fine chemicals and materials production). \n\nHowever, biological systems are highly complex and initial attempts at engineering biological systems to fulfill specific application goals, are often only partially successful. To help overcome these challenges, synthetic biology employs the concept of the design-cycle, through which biotechnologies are iteratively designed, built and tested (Arpino et al., 2013;Church et al., 2014;Kelwick et al., 2014). Learning how to improve a biological system may require multiple attempts, which could be made easier by more rapid and systematic workflows. One potential solution is to utilize cell-free synthetic biology for rapid prototyping (Moore et al., 2017b;Kelwick et al., 2018). Typically, cellfree reactions make use of isolated cellular components and machinery (e.g., ribosomes and recombinant proteins), rather than live whole-cells.",

Once genetic circuits could be constructed in an efficient and inexpensive manner with base-by-base specificity, it was possible to interrogate sequence-to-function relationships. While central to the investigation of all biological functions, for metabolic engineering applications this represented a broad advance where finer control over the expression of genes in a given pathway could be designed and implemented.

Since high level production of recombinant protein imposes significant stress in the host organism, several methods have been developed over the years to optimize protein production. So far, these trial-and-error techniques have proved laborious and sensitive to process parameters, while there has been no attempt to address the problem by applying Synthetic Biology principles and methods, such as integration of standardized parts in novel synthetic circuits.ResultsWe present a novel self-regulatory protein production system that couples the control of recombinant protein production with a stress-induced, negative feedback mechanism. The synthetic circuit allows the down-regulation of recombinant protein expression through a stress-induced promoter. We used E. coli as the host organism, since it is widely used in recombinant processes. Our results show that the introduction of the self-regulatory circuit increases the soluble/insoluble ratio of recombinant protein at the expense of total protein yield. To further elucidate the dynamics of the system, we developed a computational model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data, and provides insight on the interplay between protein solubility and yield.ConclusionOur work introduces the idea of a self-regulatory circuit for recombinant protein products, and paves the way for processes with reduced external control or monitoring needs. It demonstrates that the library of standard biological parts serves as a valuable resource for initial synthetic blocks that needs to be further refined to be successfully applied in practical problems of biotechnological significance. Finally, the development of a predictive model in conjunction with experimental validation facilitates a better understanding of the underlying dynamics and can be used as a guide to experimental design.",

In recent years, the technology of cell-free protein synthetic system has made some breakthroughs in the fields of stability of amino acid and protein folding in vitro. Based on these technologies, this paper discusses the applications of cell-free synthetic expression system in the field of biopharmaceutical engineering to provide some references for the relative researchers. Concept of cell-free protein synthetic system With the development of biotechnology, protein expression technology has been mastered by most researchers. The routine application of protein expression technique is usually used in Escherichia coli, yeast, mammalian cells and insect cell. It was transformed or transfected by plasmid, the nucleic acid into the cell, then the use of amino acid residues, ribosomes and intracellular enzyme to protein synthesis. In these expression systems, because of the advantages of convenient culture, short protein synthesis time, low cost and high efficiency, it is widely used. But the limitations and shortcomings of Escherichia coli expression system is also very significant, the problem has also been plagued and hinder researchers to obtain ideal protein to carry out research, urgently needs a better way to synthesis protein. Cell-free protein synthesis system as a rapid and efficient in vitro protein synthesis by means of synthetic enzymes in the cell extract of the complement of transcription and translation of the required material substrate and energy to complete target protein. Compared with the traditional living cells in vivo expression system based on cell-free protein synthesis system has many advantages, such as no membrane barrier, gene polymerase concentration control, quantitative measurement and high throughput. Technical progress of cell-free protein synthetic system It needs to consume a lot of energy in the process of protein synthesis. The research shows that the reaction time for energy shortage will directly reduce the cell-free protein synthesis system and reduce the production efficiency of the system, so the choice of appropriate energy supply system is essential for improving the production efficiency of the system. A series of studies found that the use of cell-free protein synthesis system protein synthesis, amino acid will be consumed due to reaction termination in the reaction starting within 30 min, supplemented by the corresponding 2nd International Conference on Materials Science, Machinery and Energy Engineering (MSME",

These synthetic strategies have been applied for the efficient production of l-tyrosine in E. coli (Juminaga et al., 2012) and for the successful production of SA in Corynebacterium glutamicm (Zhang et al., 2015), respectively. Great advances in SA production in E. coli have been made over the past decades. However, more and new developments must be made, taking into account the vast, recently acquired data from omics technology. These data, along with their integration with ME technology and experience, can lead to more global insight into cell physiology, allowing new engineering techniques from a systems ME perspective to be identified and developed.",

These include the understanding of gene circuitry and the protein-based regulation of gene transcription as well as the tools provided by recombinant DNA technology (e.g., Jacob and Monod 1961;Szybalski and Skalka 1978). These foundational concepts and methods made synthetic biology possible, in principle. In practice, recombinant DNA allowed the production of engineered proteins, but the engineering of whole organisms has had to wait for four developments: inexpensive DNA synthesis, rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, a large collection of components in the form of well-characterized genetic modules from years of study and from genome sequencing efforts, and a selfconscious importation of engineering approaches. The importance of DNA synthesis and sequencing in synthetic biology has been reviewed by others (Carlson 2003;Knight 2005), so we will focus on the availability of modular genetic parts. For synthetic biology, the modules of biological systems, from DNA to RNA, protein, and pathway levels, constitute a natural set of building blocks for engineering.",

            "text": "As an emerging research field of bioengineering, synthetic biology has undergone dramatic growth throughout the past decade. Synthetic biology, which can be described as the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature [15], has transformed how scientists can apply biology for the benefit of society. Well-characterised biological parts that are integrated into a well-known host (i.e. chassis) have resulted in many synthetic biology success stories, such as microbial artemisinin production for malaria treatment [16] and automated systems for the construction of DNA-based logic circuits [17]. Given their long history as the biotechnology work-horses, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the natural choices for synthetic biology chassis. Their convenience of use is driven by the ease of genetic engineering, broadly available genetic tools, and deep knowledge about their biology at the molecular level. \n\nHowever, many industrially relevant applications involve conditions and substrates that are not suitable for the conventional genetic engineering hosts. When considering biomining as an example, E. coli lacks the required key cell characteristics and mechanisms, such as the ability to tolerate multiple stress factors, namely low pH, high temperatures, high metals concentrations and the presence of other inhibitory compounds, which are not currently genetically tractable or feasible to introduce. Therefore, many industrially interesting but previously undomesticated organisms are being increasingly investigated as potential synthetic biology chassis [18,19]. Although the basic design principles of synthetic biology can be applied regardless of the host that is used, the actual engineering at cell level requires well-characterised parts [20] and genetic tools, which are typically very host-dependent. Efficient methods for transformation and genomic integration for knock-out/knock-in, functional selection markers, and inducible expression systems are essential tools for part characterisation. However, part characterisation remains a prerequisite for the design and construction of more complex systems, which in turn may open up new opportunities to overcome technical challenges not solvable with traditional engineering.",

The first challenge is that it is difficult for cyanobacteria to reach the theoretical yield due to the deficiency of genetic manipulation tools, and novel promoters or ribosome binding sites for precise gene expression control should be further investigated. The next challenge is that although the genome editing of cyanobacteria is simple, the cycle is relatively slow. The traditional homologous recombination-mediated approach should integrate heterologous expression modules into chromosomes or endogenous plasmids but has the challenge of being time-consuming, and the use of a broad-host-range vector faces the problem of compatibility. 106 Further, developing stable shuttle expression vectors in cyanobacteria will accelerate the construction of recombinant cyanobacteria. 107 oreover, the industrial application of cyanobacteriamediated light-driven biotransformation is limited due to scale-up difficulties, and the illumination efficiency and light availability were the main limiting factors. 108 Consequently, novel photobioreactors should be developed to allow a short light path between the light source and the medium. Taken together, the development of stable shuttle expression vectors and novel photobioreactors would provide us with better research capabilities in cyanobacteria-mediated light-driven biotransformation.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology provides innovative solutions to overcome the challenges associated with expression, engineering, and screening.A key advancement is the development of strategies targeting multiple synthetic biology levels, including individual proteins, pathways, metabolic flux, and host optimization.This approach significantly enhances the feasibility and effectiveness of RiPP preparation by tailoring the host's metabolic machinery to support RiPP biosynthesis.Moreover, synthetic biology enables the engineering of RiPPs by reconstituting precursor peptides, wherein different functional groups are added to the core peptides.This interchangeability of substrate elements is crucial to tailoring RiPPs both in vivo and in vitro, thereby expanding the chemical and functional space of RiPPs.\n\nRiPPs are produced via two distinct approaches including (1) natural biosynthesis and (2) heterologous expression.Natural biosynthesis utilizes the organism's inherent metabolic pathways to produce RiPPs.Producing RiPPs in their native environment ensures correct folding and PTMs essential for their biological activity, as well as the natural diversity of RiPP structures and bioactivities.However, natural biosynthesis is limited by scalability, variability in yield, purity, and gene silencing [64].To address these issues, considerable research efforts have focused on heterologous expression in surrogate hosts like E. coli or Streptomyces sp.Heterologous expression allows researchers to circumvent the complexity and the limitations of native genetic systems, typically using model organisms whose genetic manipulation and scale-up are easier than source organisms.This approach, however, presents challenges such as the complexity of reconstituting native biosynthetic machinery in a heterologous host and stability issues with precursor peptides [18][19][20].Additionally, PTMs may occur differently between the host and the native producer, potentially affecting the final RiPP structure and activity.Despite these challenges, heterologous expression (Figure 3) has offered opportunities for discovery and innovation beyond the capabilities of natural biosynthesis.\n\nisms whose genetic manipulation and scale-up are easier than source organisms.",

Significant advancements in ginsenoside production have been achieved through metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches. Yeast, due to intracellular structures similar to plant cells and the presence of the MVA pathway, has become an important platform for ginsenoside production. Yeast metabolism has been engineered to enhance the availability of precursors and optimize key enzymes in the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway. Particularly, chaperone-assisted expression systems have provided a fundamental production platform, overcoming challenges related to the functional expression of plant enzymes in microbial hosts and resulting in significantly improved ginsenoside production yields. Furthermore, the use of subcellular organelles and protein scaffolds in yeast has revolutionized ginsenoside production. By localizing biosynthetic enzymes and pathways within organelles such as peroxisomes, metabolic fluxes have been enhanced, leading to increased yield. Additionally, synthetic biology has enabled the functional expression of plant-derived enzymes in bacterial cells, resulting in successful ginsenoside production. These advancements highlight the potential of synthetic biology in ginsenoside production. The integration of these approaches has paved the way for more efficient and sustainable synthesis methods, addressing the demand for potent natural products.",

            "text": "transformation efficiency, synthetic biology has made enormous strides in plant biology research. \n\nDespite being a relatively new field of research, synthetic biology has enabled the discovery of multiple new chemicals, exploration of advanced protein expression regulation, and production of novel high-value proteins like biopharmaceuticals within chloroplasts. These advancements in chloroplast biotechnology have been discussed in seminal reviews (Bock, 2015;Boehm and Bock, 2019). New research that is enabling chloroplast biotechnology includes the ability to monitor the expression of proteins in vivo through a luciferase reporter (Matsuo et al., 2006), gene activation can be enabled through a site-specific recombinase (Tungsuchat-Huang et al., 2011), a synthetic riboswitch (Verhounig et al., 2010), and metabolic pathway engineering is possible through synthetic multigene operons (Lu et al., 2013). These approaches may, in the future, be used in combination with nanotechnology approaches within diverse wild-type plants, for which currently there are no transformation and genome modification protocols available. Containing these new molecular and genetic regulatory mechanisms and proteins are possible through chloroplast biotechnology. As shown in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, codon reassignment allows an additional avenue for biocontainment (Young and Purton, 2016). Biocontainment within chloroplasts may allow researchers to rapidly and specifically produce proteins within wild-type strains at specific time periods for a better understanding of nuclear-chloroplast protein expression and regulation. In addition, synthetic biology may be further enabled by a chloroplast transformation with large mutant libraries for the entire plastid genome. Facile in vivo assembly of chloroplast transformation vectors have been developed for plastid engineering (Wu et al., 2017a). The first fully exogenous plastid transformation has been completed in C. reinhardtii (O'Neill et al., 2012). The in situ ability of nanotechnology DNA delivery may enable new directed evolution approaches to screen large mutant libraries.",

Along with S. cerevisiae, the non-conventional yeast systems such as K. lactis, P. pastoris were engineered to enhance the production of heterologous proteins. These modified systems are gaining more attention considering their potential to synthesize products compatible for human. The different steps of recombinant protein production in yeast, from start to end, can be engineered in a successful manner by improving fermentation methods, expression systems, and introducing synthetic biology techniques. Through the years the ability to identify strains and introduce desired genes of our interest under active promoter system with proper secretion signals was achieved. Now it is possible to control intracellular proteases and ubiquitination which degrade the recombinant proteins, reduce the stress an increase space in endoplasmic reticulum, proper folding and help in translocation to golgi complex. The improvements in glycosylation engineering make it possible to produce humanized compounds that have better half-life and less immunogenicity. However, more innovative engineering techniques should be implemented in the synthetic and secretory pathways of the yeast system to produce therapeutic proteins.",

Synthetic biology has been paved after recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s. So originally synthetic means recombinant or engineered, in biology. Although useful engineering system based on T4, T7, , or other viruses has been introduced, the technology is mostly fully developed in the filamentous phages (Figure 1). Phages are viruses that infect bacterial cells, and many commercial vectors for recombinant DNA studies are from phages. Synthetic phage utilizes their genetic information of coat proteins. Phage display is a practical example of how we can make synthetic viruses for different purposes. Using standard recombinant DNA technology, interested foreign peptides (or proteins) expression can be realized by incorporation of corresponding coding sequences onto each replicable viral coat DNA (Figure 2).

            "text": "A n overarching goal of synthetic biology is to design biological systems for useful applications. In exploring the space of possibilities, one logical approach is to consider the characteristic properties of living systems, how they may be useful and how synthetic biology tools can engineer them. Three such properties are evolvability, self-organization, and responsiveness to environment. We propose that (1) these properties of living systems have been productively applied in synthetic biology, (2) these characteristics are useful to materials science by enabling new functionalities and synthesis capabilities, and (3) synthetic biology is well-positioned to harness these features to create novel living functional materials and materials foundries ( Figure 1).\n\nProtein engineering and heterologous expression have allowed protein domains to be borrowed from nature and modified or fused in various combinations to generate useful products, such as soft materials. 1 For example, pH and temperature-sensitive leucine zipper domains fused to hydrophilic domains have led to polymers that reversibly form a hydrogel in response to their environment. 2 Spider silk protein has also been recombinantly expressed and spun into fibers, with processing of this aggregation-prone protein facilitated by extracellular secretion. 3 Traditionally, when engineered proteins are used as building blocks for materials, only the first step in creating the materials (i.e., heterologous expression of subunits) is performed by cells. Assembly of subunits into higher-order structures is performed in vitro after subunit purification. However, living systems are capable of much more than heterologous protein expression. As a result of advances in synthetic biology, there is the opportunity to evolve or design materials subunits and to engineer cells to assemble subunits into higher-order materials, rather than depend solely on in vitro assembly. 4 Having cells perform assembly, or even be incorporated as part of the final material, would open up many new capabilities for novel materials, such as self-healing, remodeling, hierarchical organization, and other properties characteristic of living systems. Furthermore, such materials could be grown in bottom-up, energy efficient processes, thus enabling distributed manufacturing. We envision that these living functional materials could revolutionize the fundamental ways in which our world makes and uses materials.",

            "text": "for recombinant silk production have been proposed [152][153][154][155]. At first, the most viable production used transgenic silkworm (Bombyx mori) [152,154]. The insertion of the gene MaSp1 to B. mori showed the viability of large-scale production of silk in the animal [154]. Nevertheless, the use of this model limits the production to silk fibers and does not allow for isolated protein production, limiting its engineering possibilities. In response, research groups proposed the production of silk in bacterial, yeast, animal and plant systems. Of special interest is the production of recombinant silk in Escherichia coli.. Edlund et al. [152] forecasted that E. coli silk production may lower the costs (as low as $23 USD per kg) and reduce the environmental impact (with a minimal carbon footprint of 55 kg CO 2 eq. per kg of silk). Nevertheless, recombinant silk production in E. coli faces more complex challenges than the standard recombinant protein production, as silk protein is highly hydrophobic and tends to form aggregates, limiting its productivity and the amount of correctly folded protein obtained [155]. To overcome this challenge, Abelein et al. [156] mutated the N terminal of the spider silk protein subunits by inverting its general charge resulting in higher recombinant production yield in E. coli. This shows protein engineering potential for more efficient and less resource-intensive production of recombinant silks.\n\nThe major advantage of biological systems to produce proteins of interest is the possibility to manipulate and optimize their physical and chemical characteristics through mutagenesis, enabling genetic engineered processes. As an example, GFP and reflectins have been tailored to perform specialized tasks [111,141,142]. These modifications allowed new protein properties, which lead to new optical properties of the materials where they were used.\n\nDespite advances in protein production through biological expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems, chemical synthesis has emerged as an attractive alternative to introduce homogeneous and site-selective specific modifications in a protein of interest [157]. Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is the most efficient technique for polypeptide chemical preparation. SPPS involves numerous repetitive coupling reaction steps on",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is an enabling technology that aims to increase predictive capacity and reconcile complexity in biological systems. This field generally applies rational engineering principles, usually framed around the ubiquitous Design-Build-Test(-Learn) cycle, to rapidly develop gain-of-function in living systems. The Design-Build-Test cycle represents the primary three cogs which accelerate the translation of an idea into a product, application or cellular gain of function (Figure 3). Although several definitions exist, synthetic biology may be defined simply as the engineering of biology; incorporating principles and tools such as orthogonality, modularity, automation, standardisation, robustness and a strong emphasis on rational design [31]. Largely driven by technological advances in DNA synthesis, corresponding decreases in cost, advances in computational methods and the elucidation of complex metabolic pathways, synthetic biology has significantly advanced our ability to produce complex natural products in yeast. This section briefly summarises several synthetic biology approaches that may be used to improve biopharmaceutical production in yeast. This topic has previously been reviewed in greater depth [16]. Due to the inherent codon bias between different organisms, a common approach is to re-code genes (synonymous recoding) to improve translation efficiency. For instance, it was demonstrated that the recoding of the Igk chain protein from mouse (Mus musculus) for production in S. cerevisiae led to a 50-fold increase in protein yield [32]. It should be noted that other dimensions of codon bias do exist, and matching codon usage to general tRNA abundance may not necessarily impart the highest yield (reviewed in greater depth [33]). For example, it may be beneficial to optimise codon usage to genes expressed under the specific condition of interest, such as those expressed highly during stationary-phase growth, pH, carbon source or respiration amongst others [34]. Several iterations of the same gene may therefore be required to optimise yield. \n\nA powerful approach used in synthetic biology is the application of modularity. The commonlyapplied Golden Gate assembly method uses Type IIS restriction enzymes for modular one-pot DNA assembly [35], and may be used to rapidly construct and screen promoter-gene pairs to identify the optimal configuration for gene expression.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production is a process of great industrial interest, with products that range from pharmaceuticals to biofuels. Since high level production of recombinant protein imposes significant stress in the host organism, several methods have been developed over the years to optimize protein production. So far, these trial-and-error techniques have proved laborious and sensitive to process parameters, while there has been no attempt to address the problem by applying Synthetic Biology principles and methods, such as integration of standardized parts in novel synthetic circuits. We present a novel self-regulatory protein production system that couples the control of recombinant protein production with a stress-induced, negative feedback mechanism. The synthetic circuit allows the down-regulation of recombinant protein expression through a stress-induced promoter. We used E. coli as the host organism, since it is widely used in recombinant processes. Our results show that the introduction of the self-regulatory circuit increases the soluble/insoluble ratio of recombinant protein at the expense of total protein yield. To further elucidate the dynamics of the system, we developed a computational model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data, and provides insight on the interplay between protein solubility and yield. Our work introduces the idea of a self-regulatory circuit for recombinant protein products, and paves the way for processes with reduced external control or monitoring needs. It demonstrates that the library of standard biological parts serves as a valuable resource for initial synthetic blocks that needs to be further refined to be successfully applied in practical problems of biotechnological significance. Finally, the development of a predictive model in conjunction with experimental validation facilitates a better understanding of the underlying dynamics and can be used as a guide to experimental design.",

            "text": "In another study, using the same methodology, the successful nuclear transgenes' expression of Chlamydomonas was also reported for HIV P24 antigen production [28]. By introducing the fully codon optimized gene versions of original wild-type strains, recombinant protein production increased up to 0.25% of overall protein content. The obtained transformants remained stable over time and culture cycles. With another method, other studies described a recipient strain and new vectors, which led to a codon optimized synthetic gene encoding human growth hormone (hGH) [22]. Synthetic algal promoters (saps) were designed to enhance nuclear gene expression in C. reinhardtii, and the results indicated that this synthetic promoter could reach greater expression levels for exogenous genes than the native promoter [29]. The authors demonstrated the usefulness of synthetic promoters to drive gene expression as a complementary method for the production of recombinant proteins. With another method, bacterial Tat export signal peptides were applied to translocate recombinant proteins within the thylakoid lumen of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, and the result presented an innovative approach of using thylakoid lumen as a new compartment for producing recombinant proteins, which provided more protective environments for delicate proteins [30]. \n\nEnhancing rates of recombinant proteins' synthesis and secretion by the microalgal cells is the other key challenge for achieving efficient industrial production. Recently, via a yellow fluorescent protein, Venus, as a reporter, the metalloprotease gametolysin signal sequence enabled secretion of recombinant Venus with yield of 1.3 mg L \u22121 . This yield was improved up to 12-fold by the introduction of synthetic (SP) glycomodules within C. reinhardtii, leading to expression of this protein as fusion glycoproteins and reaching the highest secretion rate obtained to date for recombinant microalgae proteins [20]. The glycoprotein secretion did not decrease cell growth under the tested conditions.",

            "text": "The development of economically feasible and sustainable biotechnological processes as alternatives to oil based chemistry is one of the major goals of biobased economy. The success of this strategy will require efficient, robust and versatile cell factories but the improvement of currently used strains towards such platforms is hindered by the limitations of conventional methods for strain improvement. Synthetic biology is expected to provide means for engineering cell factories in a more efficient and controllable way. Synthetic biology is regarded as the engineering discipline by which novel organisms can be constructed by assembling parts, devices and modules into systems. Proponents such as the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) foundation aim at a high level of standardization and foster the definition of a framework of rules for the conceptualization, design and manufacture of biological systems with predictable properties. A more practical, problem driven approach, however, sees synthetic biology as the field that makes use of advanced tools of genetic engineering, genomics and systems biology in order to programme and control a biological device and create new behaviour previously not found in that system. In contrast to the former approach, this description does not draw a clear line to other sciences; the designation of a strain as simply genetically engineered or synthetic seems rather arbitrary. Because of the complexity of biological systems, each problem is seen as unique and the occurrence of unpredictable effects of genetic modifications is expected, making attempts for standardization a futile effort. Irrespective of the ongoing debate about its definition [1,2], there is general agreement that the success of synthetic biology in biotechnology will rely on the development of new methods to analyse and control cell systems and to allow for the targeted modification of genomes on a large scale. Hence, with the advance of recent genome editing techniques, of next generation sequencing and gene synthesis, and the merging of large datasets with modelling and novel bioinformatics tools, we expect that synthetic biology will significantly advance the design of industrially relevant strains for producing novel chemicals. \n\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most intensively studied unicellular eukaryote and one of the main industrial microorganisms used in the production of biochemicals.",

PURE consists of 36 reconstituted proteins capable of cell-free transcription and translation. Proteins were purified using His-tag-based affinity chromatography (Shimizu et al., 2001). A recombinant-based cell-free system was made possible as a result of an improved understanding of cellular biochemistry and the molecular machinery involved in transcription and translation. Various studies on the PURE system were performed to make PURE preparation easier and to decrease its cost (Shepherd et al., 2017;Villarreal et al., 2018;Lavickova and Maerkl, 2019). Productivity and functionality was increased by adjusting the various PURE components (Li et al., 2014) and by supplementing additional factors to the system (Maddalena et al., 2016;Li et al., 2017b).\n\nWith the advent of cell-free systems and the PURE system becoming more accessible and affordable, it is beginning to be used in various applications. The PURE system has been explored as a platform for producing therapeutic proteins (Cai et al., 2015;Dondapati et al., 2020) and for molecular diagnostics (Pardee et al., 2016). The modular nature of PURE has made this system also an appealing starting point for bottom-up synthetic cell approaches (Niederholtmeyer, Stepanova, and Maerkl, 2013;Lavickova, Laohakunakorn, and Maerkl, 2020). We have recently written a comprehensive review covering various aspects and applications of cell-free synthetic biology , and the focus of this review lies on aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and tRNA biochemistry and engineering in the context of cell-free systems.",

Synthetic biology is to engineer artificial biological systems to investigate natural biological phenomena and for a variety of applications. Synthetic biology will revolutionize how we conceptualize and approach the engineering of biological systems. The vision and applications of this emerging field will influence many other scientific and engineering disciplines, as well as affect various aspects of daily life and society (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). Synthetic biology builds living machines from the off-the-shelf chemical ingredients, utilizing many of the same strategies that electrical engineers employ to make computer chips (Tucker & Zilinskas, 2006). The main goal of the nascent field of synthetic biology is to design and construct biological systems with the desired behavior (Alon, 2003; Alon, 2007; Andrianantoandro et al., 2006; Church, 2005; Endy, 2005; Hasty et al., 2002; Heinemann & Panke, 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2004; Pleiss, 2006; Tucker & Zilinskas, 2006). By a set of powerful techniques for the automated synthesis of DNA molecules and their assembly into genes and microbial genomes, synthetic biology envisions the redesign of natural biological systems for greater efficiency as well as the construction of functional \u201cgenetic circuit\u201d and metabolic pathways for practical purposes (Andrianantoandro, et al., 2006; Ferber, 2004; Forster & Church, 2007; Gardner, et al., 2000; Heinemann & Panke, 2006; Isaacs, et al., 2006; Maeda & Sano, 2006; Tucker & Parker, 2000). Synthetic biology is foreseen to have important applications in biotechnology and medicine (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). Though the engineering of networks of inter-regulating genes, so-called synthetic gene networks, has demonstrated the feasibility of synthetic biology (Gardner et al., 2000),",

It is a multidisciplinary science in a true sense as it derives knowledge from various disciplines (such as genetics, nanotechnology, chemical engineering, robotics, systems biology and computational biology), in order to manipulate living cells to obtain desired functions. \n\nOver the past decade, synthetic biology has emerged as an engineering discipline for biological systems. Compared with other substrates, biology possess a unique set of engineering challenges resulting from an incomplete understanding of natural biological systems and tools for manipulating them. It is speculated that with further technological advancements and understanding of the biological phenomenon, greater avenues for synthetic biology applications will emerge which would allow incorporation of the information generated through various projects based on genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics [6]. \n\nSynthetic biology aims at enablement of creation of living organisms with user defined genetic circuitry and novel characteristics by modulating, regulating and redesigning the gene expression profile of the host organism, enabling its exploitation for various applications [7]. As a stepping stone towards this direction, micro-organisms (such as Escherichia coli) with minimal genome have been created [8]. Such microbes can be further transformed with genes conferring them novel functions. \n\nOn the other hand, microbiology, the multidisciplinary science of microorganisms, has a significant impact on the world. With its roots in the 19th century, it matured into a scientific discipline concerned with the structure, function, and classification of these organisms and with ways of controlling and using their activities. It continued to evolve into the major subdivisions of microbiology, which include medical, industrial, agricultural, food and dairy. Microbiology is used to treat major pandemics and frequent infections. It also has an impact on the food people consume [9], and it has been shown that the recently identified natural antitumor compounds from various natural origins including fungi and endophytic fungi [10].",

Cell-free systems have several key features. They circumvent mechanisms that have evolved to facilitate species survival, bypass limitations on molecular transport across the cell wall, enable high-yielding and rapid synthesis of proteins without creating recombinant cells, and provide high tolerance towards toxic substrates or products. Here, we analyze ~750 published patents and ~2000 peer-reviewed manuscripts in the field of cell-free systems. Three hallmarks emerged. First, we found that both patent filings and manuscript publications per year are significantly increasing (five-fold and 1.5-fold over the last decade, respectively). Second, we observed that the innovation landscape has changed. Patent applications were dominated by Japan in the early 2000s before shifting to China and the USA in recent years. Finally, we discovered an increasing prevalence of biotechnology companies using cell-free systems. Our analysis has broad implications on the future development of cell-free synthetic biology for commercial and industrial applications.",

            "text": "In this study, we aim to establish a robust and high-yielding P. putida-based CFPS system. After establishing the baseline ability to synthesize super-folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) as a reporter, we set out to increase protein synthesis yields to greater than 100 mg/ml by systematically optimizing process parameters. Specifically, we assessed the impact of temperature, lysate content, plasmid concentration and magnesium ion concentration on protein synthesis yields. We observed a $10fold increase in sfGFP yields relative to the unoptimized case, resulting in a final titer of approximately 200 mg/ml in 4-h batch reaction. We went on to demonstrate that CFPS reactions could be programed with linear DNA templates. By use of overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we show that transcription and translation elements (i.e. T7 promoter) can be rapidly added to the coding region of gene, which efficiently directs a combined transcription and translation process in vitro. Finally, we applied our P. putida-based CFPS system to the expression of a library of genetic parts, specifically ribosome binding sites (RBSs), which covered a 10-fold range of expression values. Looking forward, we anticipate that our P. putida-based CFPS system will provide broad utility for functional annotation, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.",

            "text": "Cell-free systems have historically been a fundamental tool for biological research. This was partially a necessity, as transformation technologies to introduce DNA into E. coli (Mandel & Higa, 1970) and modern recombinant DNA technology (Smith & Welcox, 1970) were not available until 1970. As a result, many scientific phenomena were limited to probing in crude lysates. The most-well known is Nirenberg's use of a cell-free system to decipher the genetic code for the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1968 (Nirenberg & Matthaei, 1961).\n\nWhen recombinant DNA technology became mainstream and working in cellular hosts the norm, cell-free systems were relegated to the production of hard-to-produce or high-value proteins such as antibodies (Ryabova, Desplancqh, & Spirin, 1997;Yin et al., 2012) or cytotoxic agents (Martemyanov, Shirokov, Kurnasov, Gudkov, & Spirin, 2001;Salehi et al., 2016). Significant field focus has been on producing large amounts of proteins, either by engineering of the cell-free system itself (Kigawa, Yabuki, Yoshida, Tsutsui, & Ito, 1999) or through assisted methods of production (Spirin, Baranov, Ryabova, & Ovodov, 1988a). These methods all utilize the ability of cell-free systems to efficiently produce protein without interference from cellular growth and metabolism. In addition, many systems are driven by T7 RNA polymerase expression (Krieg & Melton, 1987) to encourage as much protein production as possible. Completely \"synthetic\" cellfree systems from purified components (Shimizu et al., 2001) have also been developed for hard-to-produce proteins.\n\nThere has been a recent resurgence of using cell-free systems as a fundamental\n\ntool. An overview contrasting this approach to utilizing systems for expression is given in Figure 1. The goal is similar to original applications probing biological phenomena, but motivated by modern-day synthetic biology tools of DNA sequencing, synthesis, and assembly. The first implementation of this was in 2003, with genetic circuits in cell-free (Noireaux, Bar-Ziv, & Li",

            "text": "Cell-free protein synthesis is an enabling technology, an important platform for many synthetic biology projects, such as: cell-free metabolic engineering [34], machine learning optimization [54], and directed evolution [47]. Herein was given an overview of the numerous applications and growing interest for cellfree expression technology, which has become an important tool for cell-free synthetic biology [9]. However, other in vitro technologies such as: molecular programs [22], and DNA supra-molecular structures [141] may provide a new level of complexity for developing original, integrated cell-free biotechnologies. In this review were presented three main topics: (i) cell-free expression system modular organization and energetic, (ii) machine learning optimization, (iii) and minimal cell synthesis. The three subjects are important for different reasons. In particular, to develop a robust bacterial cell-free expression system is essential to design accurately the energy module, which provides the main framework for high-yielding and reproducible in vitro protein synthesis. The open nature of cell-free expression technology allowed automation with robotic workstations [137]. Therefore, large amount of data can be generated by parallelized experimentation for machine learning optimization to synthesize, for example, difficult to fold proteins and small molecules for industrial and medical applications. The synthesis of a minimal cell is an important project to understand the fundamental design principles of life. This understanding will unveil novel design rules to the development of new life-like technologies that could be useful for environmental remediation, material, and medical science. The increasing interest for cell-free expression systems will generate new results, and will continue to advance cell-free synthetic biology research. As mentioned, CFPS was developed many years ago, and nowadays has become a robust tool for engineering and prototyping new systems, such as: assembly of DNA regulatory parts for gene circuit design, and ondemand production of recombinant proteins. Cell-free expression technology will be more and more a playground for engineers, microbiologists, molecular and computer scientists.",

            "text": "The origins of synthetic biology lie in the early 1960s when Jacob and Monod made groundbreaking discoveries on the regulation of lac operons in E. coli, an achievement that earned them the Nobel Prize [236].The authors found that a protein known as a transcription factor can bind to the promoter region of a gene, thereby regulating  [231,232] its synthesis rate by activating or repressing it.This paves the way for viewing gene expression as a dynamic system with recognizable inputs and outputs.This concept holds promise for combining input and output systems to construct more intricate functionalities [237].Since the late 1960s, progress in biotechnology has bestowed the scientific community with cost-effective and temporally efficient tools for DNA extraction, sequencing, amplification, and integration of exogenous DNA elements into cells.The advent of molecular cloning and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in the 1970s and the 1980s made genetic manipulation common in microbiological research.In recognition of their pioneering work on restriction endonucleases, pivotal components of DNA synthesis, Smith, Arber, and Nathans were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978 [238].This recognition began a new biotechnological era, allowing the description and analysis of existing genes as well as the construction and evaluation of novel gene arrangements.Nevertheless, in the pre-genomic period, research methods categorized as genetic engineering were primarily confined to cloning and recombinant gene expression.In essence, the field of genetic engineering lacked the requisite knowledge and tools to engineer biological systems that could exhibit the diversity and intricacy of regulatory behaviors inherent in microorganisms [239,240].\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the emergence of automated DNA sequencing and improvements in computational tools have facilitated the sequencing of entire microbial genomes [241].As biologists and computer scientists embarked on a collaborative journey to reverse engineer cellular networks, the expanding confluence of molecular biology gave birth to the field of systems biology.In 2016, a consortium of prominent scientists proposed an ambitious synthetic biology endeavor known as the Human Genome Writing Project.This initiative leverages synthetic biology tools encompassing standardized genes, whole-genome synthesis, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to craft new genomes on a substantial scale.",

The combination of complementary technologies such as mutation and genetic recombination have led to remarkable improvements in the productivity of many primary and secondary metabolites as well as protein biopharmaceuticals and enzymes. New genetic approaches for the development of overproducing strains are continuously emerging. Among those that have proven to be very successful are metabolic engineering, combinatorial biosynthesis and molecular breeding techniques.\n\nMore exciting advances are still to come as the complete sequencing of industrially important microbial genomes takes place. Functional genomics, proteomics and metabolomics are now being exploited for the discovery of novel valuable small molecules for medicine and enzymes for catalysis. microorganisms over the years led to changes in pH optimum, thermostability, feedback inhibition, carbon source inhibition, substrate specificity, Vmax, K m and K i . This information was later exploited by the more rational techniques of protein engineering. Single changes in amino acid sequences have yielded similar types of changes in a large variety of enzymes. Today, it is no longer necessary to settle for an enzyme's natural properties; these can be altered to suit the needs of the investigator or the process. For example, a protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus was increased in heat tolerance from 86\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, being made resistant to boiling. The enzyme was developed by site directed mutagenesis. 194 Only eight amino acids had to be modified. Temperature stability at 100\u00b0C was increased 340-fold without a decrease in activity at lower temperatures. All eight mutations were far from the enzyme's active site.\n\nMolecular breeding techniques, e.g., DNA shuffling, are being currently used to generate enzymes with improved properties such as: activity and stability at different pH values and temperatures, 195 increased or modified enantioselectivity, 196 altered substrate specificity, 197 stability in organic solvents, 198 novel substrate specificity and activity, 199 increased biological activity of protein pharmaceuticals and biological molecules 200 as well as novel vaccines. 201,202 Proteins from directed evolution work were already on the market by 2000. 203 These were green fluorescent protein of",

            "text": "High-level production of recombinant proteins as a prerequisite for subsequent purification has become a standard technique. Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell. For earlier reviews on high-level of gene expression in E. coli see Makrides (1996) and Swartz (2001).",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

Plasmids carrying the panARS sequence complement the existing toolbox for RPP in P. pastoris. It is hereby showed that episomal panARS plasmids outperformed the corresponding integrative plasmids in terms of protein production, efficiency of transformation, and macroscopic clonal homogeneity. Endogenous P. pastoris sequences were not nearly as efficient in BFP expression compared to panARS-based constructs. At the single cell level, discrete subpopulations of high-and low-producers were consistently detected in clones carrying episomal panARS vectors. In addition, panARS episomal plasmids could be successfully used for quick in vivo self-ligation cloning directly using fragments with overlapping DNA sequences. This method was validated for gene assembly with panARS-based vectors of varying overlapping lengths and molar ratios between fragments: the resulting minimal amount of background, and reported high reproducibility of clone behaviour will allow the application of panARS plasmids to in vivo recombination for synthetic biology applications, where complex, multigene cassettes might be more easily assembled in P. pastoris. Taken together, this report characterizes for the first time the use of panARS episomal plasmids to improve the P. pastoris molecular toolbox for synthetic biology.",

            "title": "Engineering Complexity in Bacterial Regulatory Circuits for Biotechnological Applications",
            "text": "M icroorganisms play a central role in human life, not only because they cause many diseases but also because they are used in several industrial processes. In addition to their critical importance for humankind, their fast growth in laboratory conditions and relatively easy genetic manipulation have allowed us to gather a tremendous amount of information regarding the molecular details of cell physiology and about the way microorganisms process information. In particular, the collection of this information in well-curated data banks and the advent of genomic and postgenomic approaches permitted the field of synthetic biology to emerge, initially based on microbial engineering (1). In the main workflow of synthetic biology, living cells are treated analogous to electronic devices, and cell engineering is executed through design-buildtest cycles (1). In this sense, synthetic biology approaches are directed to modify the regulatory network of the cell, enabling organisms to perform novel molecular functions, with applications ranging from biosensing toxic or dangerous compounds, to searching for and killing pathogens and cancer cells, or producing compounds of interest, among many others (2). In this context, it is critical that the gene regulatory system of the target organism is modified to perform precise and reliable computations based on a set of inputs of interest, and for this, the analogy to logic gates is very useful (3,4). Over the years, a considerable amount of effort has been dedicated toward the construction of reliable logic circuits, particularly in bacteria. For this, features such as noise in gene expression (5), composability of the biological parts used (6), signal detection range, and specificity of the circuits have been of special interest (2,7). Thus, significant advancement has been experienced in the field, and along with it, our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to the control of gene expression through the many cellular regulatory networks of interest has increased dramatically.\n\nMost of the progress experienced in the field has been possible due to both technological and methodological improvements achieved in recent years. Of note are a number of high-throughput technologies (ranging from deep DNA sequencing techniques, microfluidics, automatization of molecular biology platforms, new DNA synthesis procedures, etc.) which have allowed not only large-scale analyses of genes and genomes but also the fast and precise, simultaneous construction and testing of several variants",

            "text": "Many obstacles need to be overcome for the effective production of a biomaterial such as a recombinant spider silk capable of immobilizing proteins in its matrix. With this purpose, this project offers solutions, as of yet untested, for example: the use of microalgae as a production platform for the expression of spider silk proteins, as well as chimeras with NT and CT domains, and flanking enzybiotics. Research on transgenic microalgae are driven by the global demand for recombinant proteins and other bioproducts. This biotechnological market is growing exponentially, it has reached 140 billion dollars in sales as of 2013, and it continues to grow (Walsh 2014) with the potential for commercial application. \n\nMore than developing a product that could help thousands of patients, the development of an antibiotic chimeric biopolymer in C. reinhardtii can result in many scientific outcomes. Spider silk is a challenging material to work with, and accessing its production with chimeric and functional materials can pave the way for many applications in the biomaterial field. Moreover, the microalgae community is still incipient, in comparison to the E. coli system, and integrative projects like this one can expand the synthetic biology tools applied to this model microorganism, which will benefit the scientific community. \n\nIt is important to highlight the fact that this project will be carried out at an international competition dedicated to the development of high-level research in Synthetic Biology (iGEM -International Genetically Engineered Machine) with an open and integrative approach. This competition takes place annually in Boston, USA, and it stimulates interdisciplinary groups to problem solving through genetically modified organisms. In line with this proposal, the team responsible for this project consists of undergraduate and graduate students from various institutes of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The blending of open approaches and such interdisciplinary groups contributes to the development of the research per se , ultimately impacting its quality and depth for the better. The project is also integrated with the SynBio Brasil community, actively engaged in promoting synthetic biology education, leading to a powerful impact on scientific awareness in Brazil.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is an emerging filed with the development with DNA sequencing technology, DNA recombinant technology, computational biology, and biological engineering. It distinguishes itself from other disciplines in both its approach and its choice of object. Synthetic biology should be considered a hybrid discipline, combining both engineering and science to achieve its goal of engineering synthetic organisms. The aim of this discipline for producing a genetic product in a host cell may be not an issue in term of biological parts characterization and DNA assembly, but the modules interfacing in the future. \n\nBiological systems are dynamic, fine regulated, nonlinear complex systems [73]. It possessed a far greater degree of integration of their parts than that of non-living systems. However, the behavior of most synthetic modules has been studied in isolated cells. The function of a synthetic module may fundamentally affect host cell processes, thus altering the cellular context. This situation is further complicated and reprogramming the cell is required, which involves the creation of synthetic biological components by adding, removing, or changing genes or proteins [74]. In the multiply rounds of design, construction, and testing of new cellular components, researchers need to develop feasible and precisely predicted tools and effective methods for module construction. As a result, design of synthetic biological systems has become an iterative process of screening, modeling, construction, and testing that continues until a system achieves the desired behavior. Rational redesign based on mathematical models improves system behavior in such situations. These retooled systems are once again tested experimentally and the process is repeated as needed. Many synthetic biological systems have been engineered successfully in this fashion because the methodology is highly tolerant to uncertainty. Synthetic biology will benefit from further such development and the creation of new methods that manage uncertainty and complexity.",

            "text": "The synthesis of proteins and DNA, combined with the establishment of biocentric laws, laid the foundation for the idea of creating living organisms from scratch, leading to the rapid development of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that integrates concepts and techniques from biology, engineering, computer science, and molecular biology. It is typically defined as the redesign or engineering of existing biological components and systems using specific technologies to achieve a desired function [157] . In 2010, Gibson et al. created the first synthetic genomic cell, employing a bottom-up approach in which chemically synthesized DNA fragments were assembled to form a minimal genome necessary for the basic functioning of an organism [158] . This minimal genome offers advantages in stability and efficiency, but challenges remain, such as the difficulty of synthesizing long DNA sequences from scratch [159] . In contrast, the field of engineered bacteria often adopts a top-down strategy, which involves modifying existing organisms by removing non-essential genes from their genomes. This process frees up space and energy to optimize the expression of target genes [160] . For example, studies have shown that heterologous protein production in Lactobacillus lactis NZ9000 is significantly improved when 2.83% of the non-essential genome is deleted using the Cre-loxP deletion system [161] . Plasmid-based expression systems are commonly used in engineered bacteria, but they face limitations for clinical applications due to issues with genetic instability and the potential for biological contamination. As a result, gene-editing technologies, particularly those based on the CRISPR-Cas system, are emerging as powerful tools. These technologies have the potential to stabilize and modify probiotic genomes, enabling the alteration of their metabolic pathways and biological properties for more precise and reliable applications. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas system is an acquired immune mechanism found in most archaea and approximately half of all bacteria, where it functions to recognize and excise invading viral DNA [162] . This system consists of two main components: the sequence responsible for encoding Cas-related proteins and the CRISPR array, which contains a series of repeats interspersed with spacer sequences. The spacer sequences store fragments of foreign genetic material, allowing the organism to \"remember\" previous invaders [163] .",

            "text": "The scope of synthetic biology continues to expand and has encompassed a huge number of biological features. Its scope starts from scratch, enabling the de novo synthesis of biological systems. It has re-designed the biological systems and empowered the production of synthetic genes, RNA, DNA and proteins by undertaking the control of pathways involved in genetic regulation. It has increased the production of nano-scale RNA architectures and synthetic biological circuits which either have therapeutic or other productive uses. Furthermore, advancements in synthetic biology have enabled the generation of diversity through methods such as epPCR and site-directed mutagenesis, allowing for the creation of complex genetic variations. Additionally, synthetic biology intersects with computer engineering to design functional biological devices and circuits, utilizing computational analysis to guide the design process. Moreover, ethical and regulatory considerations are paramount in synthetic biology, with careful examination required to address dual-use concerns, environmental impacts, and issues of social justice and equitable access to benefits. As synthetic biology continues to advance, it presents opportunities to address pressing challenges in fields ranging from medicine and agriculture to environmental conservation and beyond. Thus, the fusion of synthetic biology with other scientific disciplines holds promise for transformative innovation and societal benefit. The present discussion enlightened the core of generating complex biological systems and has given a brief overview on the fusion of synthetic biology with other fields of science.Keywords:\u00a0Biological Systems; Genetic Regulation; Synthetic biology circuits",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are one of the most promising solutions to address sustainability and global climate change challenges through the development of efficient cell factories for producing fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceutics. Introduction of a biosynthetic pathway containing multiple heterologous genes is generally the first step to enable microbial synthesis. For practical applications, pathway gene expression levels must be carefully finetuned and balanced to maximize product titer, rate, and yield (TRY) [1]. However, iterative design-build-test (DBT) cycles are generally required to optimize metabolic pathways, making the development of efficient cell factories rather time-consuming. Although numerous synthetic biology tools have been developed, such as gene copy number tuning [2,3] and combinatorial transcriptional regulation [4], the build and test of the combinatorial biosynthetic pathway library remains a grand challenge for metabolic engineering. For example, it is reported that more than 100 person-years are needed to commercialize biobased 1,3-propanediol [1]. Therefore, the development of novel enabling synthetic biology tools to accelerate DBT cycles will be critical for the construction and optimization of microbial cell factories. \n\nCell-free protein synthesis system (CFPS) has been widely used for recombinant protein expression, particularly toxic proteins and membrane proteins that are difficult to express in vivo [5e9]. Recently, CFPS is further developed as an enabling platform for rapid prototyping of biosynthetic pathways and genetic circuits to address the challenges in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Compared with the conventional in vivo systems, CFPS activates biological machineries without the boundary of cell membranes and cell walls, and the open environment allows for direct monitoring and manipulation of transcription, translation and metabolism [10]. In addition, CFPS uses linear DNAs (i.e. PCR products) as templates for transcription, which bypasses the timeconsuming and laborious gene-cloning and microorganism transformation steps and allows rapid prototyping in a high-throughput manner [11].",

            "text": "Devising gene cassettes or genetic circuits that perform specific functions has long been performed in synthetic biology field. Synthetic biology tools have been developed to generate mutations in the cell with different mutation rate, mutation range (specific regions or entire genome), multiplexity, and whether the altered phenotypes are permanent or removable. The power of these tools was usually examined through improving specific phenotypes such as production of colored chemicals or tolerance. However, industrially interesting chemicals are generally indistinguishable chemicals or provide no growth benefit to producers, and thus the step of acquiring improved variants from a huge library is considered as a major limitation. \n\nThus, the development of synthetic systems that convert specific chemical concentration or desired protein functions into selectable phenotype is another key for successful evolutionary engineering. For example, the use of biosensor that links the metabolite concentration to detectable phenotype such as fluorescence and resistance to selection pressure was exemplified for lysine, naringenin, glucaric acid, mevalonic acid, 3-HP, and so on. Therefore, discovering natural regulators and developing new regulators using synthetic parts will empower the biosensor-based screening/selection step. Moreover, well-designed accessory plasmids for PACE have expanded target functions to various properties. Multiple traits can also be satisfied by complex logic gates. \n\nAltogether, the advance in synthetic biology provides efficient tools for the two main steps of evolutionary engineering: genetic perturbation and acquisition of improved phenotype. Now, it is pushed to identify effective changes from randomly generated mutations. Analyzing the consequences of mutations on cellular/ protein functions is an additional step for evolutionary engineering. Recently, facilitated omics technology has assisted evolutionary engineering. Using next-generation sequencing, tracking genome-wide multiple mutations is plausible. Moreover, the analysis of accumulated mutation in the evolved populations allows to study evolutionary paths. \n\nThe growing interest of bioindustry demands much complex phenotype or use of non-model strain. Therefore, the utility of evolutionary engineering which can optimize cellular phenotype even without intensive biological information will increase. The synthetic genetic tools will accelerate evolution of much diverse phenotypes in various microbes. \n\n\u2022 fast, convenient online submission \u2022 thorough peer review by experienced researchers in your field \u2022 rapid publication on acceptance",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is often reported to have emerged as a field of biotechnology in the early 2000s, with the convergence of engineering principles with biology (European Academies Science Advisory Council [EASAC], 2010). This time saw the first international meetings on \"synthetic biology\" and the beginning of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition (Gray et al., 2018). It also saw the emergence of a new lexicon that reflected engineering concepts, e.g., standardized \"parts\" (such as \"Biobricks\"), chassis, circuits, plug-and-play; and claims of a new scientific culture of greater collaboration facilitated by the standardization of processes across labs, and openness and ethical awareness (Crow, 2018). The rapid adoption of the term \"synthetic biology\" may have been facilitated by its use by a self-defining new generation of researchers from a variety of disciplines (Oldham et al., 2012) seeking to differentiate themselves from past controversies, and also avoid issues with attracting funding and public acceptance. However, the highprofile publication of the first self-replicating bacterial cell with a fully synthetic \"computer-designed\" chromosome in 2010 (Gibson et al., 2010), which was accompanied by headlines proclaiming that man had created life 13 , returned the spotlight on biotechnology regulation, and triggered new discussions on international regulatory oversight under the CBD. \n\nToday many definitions and descriptions of synthetic biology can be found, but there are none that are universally agreed or applicable to everything that may be labeled as such in the CBD discussions. Fields or sub-areas of biotechnology that may be referred to as synthetic biology in the scientific literature and example applications are listed in Figure 3. At its simplest, synthetic biology may be described as combining DNA or genetic \"parts\" in novel configurations to modify existing properties or to create new ones (Oldham et al., 2012). More broadly, there is a general consensus that synthetic biology is a dynamic and growing area of biotechnology that utilizes accumulated and constantly advancing knowledge and understanding in biological engineering, and advancements in engineering tools (Raimbault et al., 2016). As for recombinant DNA technologies (Berg and Singer, 1995), synthetic biology is expected to have a profound impact on our knowledge of fundamental life processes.",

            "text": "The expansion of biologics and the biopharmaceutical industry has fuelled the demand for recombinant proteins in recent years [1,2]. As the major factor influencing product quality and process cost, the selection of biological platforms used as cell factories is particularly important [3,4]. For structurally simple proteins that do not require posttranslational modifications, prokaryotic cells, particularly Escherichia coli, are still the preferred expression systems [5]. However, considering that secreting the desired protein into the supernatant significantly simplifies downstream processing and reduces the total cost [6,7], several gram-positive bacterial expression systems with prominent secretory capacity have recently been developed [8,9]. Among them, Corynebacterium glutamicum, the long-established industrial workhorse for the production of a variety of amino acids [10], possesses enormous potential for the secretory production of recombinant proteins due to its safety, excellent fermentation performance and concise secretory environment (minimal endogenous secretory proteins and rarely detectable protease activity) [11]. \n\nFor a high-performance expression system, optimal promoter sequences and efficient regulatory mechanisms are essential prerequisites; thus, many attempts have been made to enhance protein yield through promoter engineering. The methods for obtaining promoters with desirable properties and strength in C. glutamicum fall into three main categories: 1) mutagenesis of the existing strong promoters, e.g., the tac-M promoter with an extended \u2212 10 region mutation [12]; 2) a fully synthetic library, e.g., the H36 promoter from a 70-bp random sequence library [13]; 3) screening naturally occurring promoters (NOPs) [14]. Several regulatable NOPs have been identified by screening under specific conditions, e.g., maltose and gluconate-inducible promoters [15], which are beneficial for protein production without impacting cell proliferation.",

            "text": "The rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, at the crossroads of molecular biology, genetics and quantitative sciences, aims at developing living technologies by re-engineering the makeup of organisms. The joint effort in this field has been giving rise to methodologies and tools for navigating the highly complex \"wiring\" of biological systems in a systematic manner. As a result, the recent developments move this field from being trial-and-error-driven towards standardisation as in mature fields of engineering. The applications in this field are designed by channelling the quantitative understanding of the molecular processes to a methodological workflow that can be compared to the use of mechanics in civil engineering. In this respect, very much like computer-aided design became an essential element of mature engineering disciplines, synthetic biology calls for computational methods for containing and accelerating the design process, see, e.g., in [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nSynthetic biology applications are commonly designed by rewiring biological circuits to enhance and benefit from their capacity for certain tasks. The aim, in this setting, is to govern the function of the organism in a logical form by introducing a \"computing-like behaviour\" [6]. Applications are then obtained by modifying the organisms by targeted interventions that introduce the designed modifications. This vision, which goes back to the production of cheese and alcoholic beverages, extends to more contemporary domains with an industrial ambition, including those with an impact on society. Modified organisms are today envisioned to yield products that ordinarily depend on petrochemicals, e.g., fuels, plastic, and cosmetics. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is another example, whereby microorganisms such as E. coli are used to profit from their inherent regulatory mechanisms that efficiently respond to phosphate starvation [7]. \n\nSynthetic biology applications are typically based on introducing a genetic sequence that captures the desired phenotypic variability in the expression of the related genes in the engineered microorganism. Gene promoters are essential elements for gene expression regulation at the transcriptional level. Even a small modification of their nucleotide sequence can significantly change the transcription factor affinity for the promoter and the binding time span. It has been extensively proven that mutations in promoters affect gene expression [8].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, P. pastoris cannot produce or secrete all proteins to such high titers. Under normal conditions, the protein production is obviously lower, especially with the expression of complex proteins which are hetero-oligomers, attached to membrane or easily suffer proteolytic degradation (Ahmad et al., 2014). \n\nSince it was first discovered, various approaches have been applied to reshape P. pastoris based on their needs. Although P. pastoris has served as a standard platform for production of RPs for many decades, some limitations still exist that prevent it from being a trustable \"cell factory\" with high productivity and adaptability. Few powerful transcription tools are currently available in P. pastoris (Yang and Zhang, 2018), meanwhile, common used promoters of P. pastoris such as P AOX1 respond to methanol, which has the drawbacks of toxic, flammable, and explosive (Gasser et al., 2015;Vogl et al., 2016). The narrow regulation mode of methanol-inducible promoters severely limits its application scope. Efforts also have been devoted to rewiring this expression host and developing new genetic tools. The beginning to use of random mutagenesis and screening procedures (Liu et al., 1992), is followed by the establishment of selectable markers (Cereghino et al., 2001) and more complex genetic engineering tools such as the Cre-lox recombinase system (Li D. et al., 2017) CRISPR/Cas9 (Gao et al., 2022a) were established over the years. The study summarized the recent advances regarding system and synthetic biology which includes metabolic engineering in the understanding of the phenotypic characteristics exhibited by recombinant Pichia and genome editing techniques like the CRISPR-Cas system. Mathematical modeling and application of high-throughput screening were also introduced here for better control of the biosynthesis pathway.",

            "text": "Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) is a method utilized for producing proteins without the limits of cell viability. The plug-and-play utility of CFPS is a key advantage over traditional plasmid-based expression systems and is foundational to the potential of this biotechnology. A key limitation of CFPS is the varying stability of DNA types, limiting the effectiveness of cell-free protein synthesis reactions. Researchers generally rely on plasmid DNA for its ability to support robust protein expression in vitro. However, the overhead required to clone, propagate, and purify plasmids reduces the potential of CFPS for rapid prototyping. While linear templates overcome the limits of plasmid DNA preparation, linear expression templates (LETs) were under-utilized due to their rapid degradation in extract based CFPS systems, limiting protein synthesis. To reach the potential of CFPS using LETs, researchers have made notable progress toward protection and stabilization of linear templates throughout the reaction. The current advancements range from modular solutions, such as supplementing nuclease inhibitors and genome engineering to produce strains lacking nuclease activity. Effective application of LET protection techniques improves expression yields of target proteins to match that of plasmid-based expression. The outcome of LET utilization in CFPS is rapid design\u2013build\u2013test\u2013learn cycles to support synthetic biology applications. This review describes the various protection mechanisms for linear expression templates, methodological insights for implementation, and proposals for continued efforts that may further advance the field.",

            "text": "While purified enzyme-based cell-free systems, as mentioned above, have been used to produce complex natural products, i.e., PKs, NRPs, and PK/NRP hybrids, by in vitro reconstruction of their biosynthetic pathways, this strategy often suffers from timeconsuming cloning steps, laborious purification process, insoluble expressed enzymes, enzyme instability and so on. Alternatively, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), in recent years, has emerged as a powerful platform technology to recombinant protein biosynthesis for applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology [9,36,37]. So far, crude extract based CFPS systems have been developed from various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, each with their own distinct advantages and opportunities [38]. Therefore, different CFPS systems have been broadly utilized for producing a wide variety of active protein products such as therapeutic vaccines [39], antibodies [40], virus-like particles [41], membrane proteins [42], metalloproteins [43], and proteins harboring non-standard amino acids [44]. In addition, CFPS has been applied for the rapid prototyping of biosynthetic pathways [45,46] and for the advancement of paper-based diagnostics [47,48]. \n\nDespite multiple types of proteins have been synthesized by the CFPS technology, expression of enzymes like PKS and NRPS from natural product biosynthetic pathways is very rare. In vivo heterologous expression of PKS and NRPS is possible, but still remains challenging in part due to their complex multidomain structures and large size with molecular weights normally ranging from one hundred to several hundreds of kilodaltons (kDa). In this context, CFPS offers an alternative protein production platform with potential advantages for the expression of natural product biosynthetic enzymes. For example, the cell-free environment allows for design-build-test cycles to be performed without the need to reengineer organisms, DNA for pathway enzymes is directly input, and substrates and cofactors needed for protein expression can be controlled and maintained at defined concentrations.",

Results As important chassis strains, filamentous microorganisms can synthesize important enzymes, chemicals, and niche pharmaceutical products through microbial fermentation. With the aid of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, filamentous bacteria, yeasts, and fungi can be developed into efficient microbial cell factories through genome engineering, pathway engineering, tolerance engineering, and microbial engineering. Mutant screening and metabolic engineering can be used in filamentous bacteria, filamentous yeasts ( Candida glabrata, Candida utilis ), and filamentous fungi ( Aspergillus sp., Rhizopus sp.) to greatly increase their capacity for chemical production. This review highlights the potential of using biotechnology to further develop filamentous bacteria, yeasts, and fungi as alternative chassis strains. Conclusions In this review, we recapitulate the recent progress in the application of filamentous bacteria, yeasts, and fungi as microbial cell factories. Furthermore, emphasis on metabolic engineering strategies involved in cellular tolerance, metabolic engineering, and screening are discussed. Finally, we offer an outlook on advanced techniques for the engineering of filamentous bacteria, yeasts, and fungi.",

            "text": "The E. coli expression system has some convenient features, such as high growth rate, high achievable cell density in culture, grows on simple culture media, and high level of recombinant protein expression. In addition, different expression platforms and engineered strains are available for special purposes, for example, for fast and easy genetic transformation. E. coli has doubling time of 20 min in Luria-Bertani broth and can reach maximum cell density of up to 200 g (DCW)/L, or near to 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [6,25,31,32]. Unlike E. coli, Bacillus subtilis has a GRAS status and is able to express extracellular proteins, consequently it is the most studied Grampositive bacterium. Other advantages of this expression system are its well-characterized genetics, its short fermentation time, and ability to grow in low-cost culture media, making it ideal for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. However, the often-low efficiency of genetic transformation and the lack of molecular biology tools have limited the application of the protein expression systems based on Bacillus [33,34]. Although bacterial systems offer many advantages, not all proteins can be suitably or readily expressed with them. Overall, they suffer from plasmid instability, and are markedly deficient when complex post-translational modifications are needed. Besides, some proteins can form inclusion bodies, which may require additional processing steps for refolding. As a result, this may substantially increase costs or undesirably affect yield. Furthermore, the possible accumulation of endotoxins, pyrogenic to humans or animals, is another disturbing drawback when therapeutic proteins are produced in E. coli [1,6,29]. Thereby, a continued search is required to find other suitable expression systems to increase either the quality, quantity, or stability of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology integrates molecular biology tools and an engineering mindset to address challenges in medicine, agriculture, bioremediation, and biomanufacturing. A persistent problem in synthetic biology has been designing genetic circuits that produce predictable levels of protein. In 2013, Mutalik and colleagues developed bicistronic designs (BCDs) that make protein production more predicable in bacterial cells (in vivo). With the growing interest in producing proteins outside of cells (in vitro), we wanted to know if BCDs would work as predictably in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) as they do in E. coli cells. We tested 20 BCDs in CFPS and found they performed very similarly in vitro and in vivo. As a step toward developing methods for protein production in artificial cells, we also tested 3 BCDs inside nanoliter-scaled microfluidic droplets. The BCDs worked well in the microfluidic droplets, but their relative protein production levels were not as predictable as expected. These results suggest that the conditions under which gene expression happens in droplets result in a different relationship between genetic control elements such as BCDs and protein production than exists in batch CFPS or in cells.",

            "text": "while the need for a constant induction at high cell densities considerably adds to costs in large scale production processes. For these reasons a pH inducible system 9 and more recently a temperature-inducible system have been proposed, 10 but both these systems rely on variable environmental parameters and as such are limited to a narrow range of cultivation conditions. One solution would be to use a pulse inducible promoter system: the promoter that drives the T7 polymerase gene (and is critical as the recombinant protein is under a T7 promoter) can be engineered to include a T7 binding site next to the inducible binding site and thus introduce positive feedback.\n\nIn this system, after the initial T7 induction from an inducer pulse, the circuit would lock in a T7-on state and would not need any further exogenous control. Another interesting avenue is to exploit the bacterial quorum sensing system so that recombinant protein expression starts only when the cell density reaches a threshold, and there has been some work in that direction. 11 Control of the accessory genes (foldases, chaperones, etc.) from auxiliary constructs so that they are produced only under stressful conditions will also increase protein yield, as this will lower the metabolic burden of their otherwise constant expression.\n\nFinally, integration of all these concepts in a single protein production system is a particularly challenging problem as the system complexity increases exponentially with each additional component that we introduce. Here is where the structured synthetic biology approach of model abstractness, standardization and automation is of paramount importance. Well-characterized and standardized parts will allow us to create computational models of dynamic circuit behavior with high predictive capacity, although efficiently capturing the dynamics in the complex bioreactor environment will always be a challenge. Despite the recent advances in computational tools for circuit behavior we altered the ribosomal binding site affinity and stress promoter strength through random mutagenesis and subsequent screening. Cells were able to modulate their protein production and achieved much higher soluble protein fractions relative to those lacking the selfregulatory control (80% vs. 55% soluble fraction) and the system operated without modifications in different media and temperature ranges. In our proof-of-concept, \"flight-to-quality,\" system, this increase in the solubility was at the expense of protein yield (in some cases more than 50% reduction",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a recently emerged field concerned with engineering complex living systems by assembling individually characterized biological parts in novel combinations. The discipline arose from the discovery of the mathematical logic of gene pairings, as well as from advances made in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The development of de novo DNA synthesis, protein engineering, and the designs of artificial gene networks have greatly contributed to the field's advancement (Heinemann and Panke, 2006). Synthetic biology seeks to determine the behavior of organisms and their parts, and then to modify and combine them into complete specific tasks. The field is based on the engineering principles of design and fabrication and focuses on the concept of standardized parts (Serrano, 2007). Precise control over the levels of protein expression is an important requirement for the robust operation of complex synthetic circuits built from many parts. \n\nDespite improving characterization and assembly methods, cycles of design, fabrication, and testing in synthetic biology can be slow. Production of circuits with desired properties can require several rounds of testing and modifying, each time editing imperfect parts by mutation or identifying alternatives. Directed evolution has been shown to provide a short cut through this phase (Yokobayashi et al., 2002), but is complicated by the additional work needed to couple networks to selective pressures. Instead, use of predictive mathematical modeling to rationally guide the design of gene networks can greatly improve design cycles to accelerate advances in synthetic biology (Ellis et al., 2009). \n\nLevels of protein expression are affected by both the transcription and translation rates but early genetic engineering approaches usually focused solely on transcription (Lipniacki et al., 2006). The transcription rate's heavy dependence on the promoter strength and the relative ease of estimating binding affinity of RNA polymerase helped its early popularity (Alper et al., 2005). However, to gain more accurate and efficient control over protein expression translation rates must also be considered. \n\nTranslation initiation is one of the major steps in translation and plays a large role in determining the overall translation rate (Laursen et al., 2005;Kudla et al., 2009).",

It is true that scientists have been attempting to design biological systems for decades.

            "text": "Microorganisms have been recognized as invaluable resources for the pharmaceutical industry, playing a pivotal role in providing a wide range of bioactive compounds and biotechnological tools [1,2]. The advancement of genetic engineering and synthetic biology has facilitated the development and utilization of microbial species for the production of complex pharmaceutical compounds, ranging from antibiotics to biologics [3,4]. For example, species of Streptomyces have been genetically modified to produce various antibiotics with improved yields [5,6]. Additionally, model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are widely utilized as primary bioreactors for the production of therapeutic proteins, including insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and other biologics [7,8]. These advancements are achieved through the optimization of genetic pathways, the enhancement of enzymatic activity, and the refinement of expression systems, facilitating the commercial-scale production of pharmaceutical products. Established approaches, such as adaptive evolution, continue to enhance the functional capabilities of microbial systems by promoting the selection of desirable phenotypic traits under carefully controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, AI and ML technologies are widely utilized to effectively optimize engineering processes, accurately predict the dynamics of metabolic processes, and innovatively design biosynthetic pathways with unprecedented precision [9,10]. These approaches facilitate the transformation of engineered microbial systems into sustainable and efficient biotechnological production platforms. However, despite recent advancements, challenges such as optimizing metabolic pathways, scaling up production processes, and ensuring regulatory compliance remain significant barriers to translating microbial engineering innovations into clinical applications [11][12][13]. Although microbial engineering has been extensively studied for pharmaceutical applications, significant gaps remain in the comprehensive and systematic integration of advanced technologies such as AI, ML, and adaptive evolution into microbial biotechnology. Additionally, the ethical and regulatory challenges of engineered microbes require further scrutiny to ensure safe and sustainable implementation. Addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary approaches that integrate genetic engineering, synthetic biology, systems biology, and bioinformatics to enhance strain productivity, improve production efficiency, and ensure safety and efficacy [14][15][16].",

            "text": "The expression and production of recombinant proteins is a key technology in various fields of research and development. For practical reasons, and in the light of recent development of peptide/protein drugs (biologics), attention has focused particularly on the efficiency of production of recombinant protein, and various host cells have been examined with the aim of achieving efficient production of such protein [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Escherichia coli is widely used in producing a variety of recombinant proteins, because the genetic engineering of this bacterium is among the best understood and developed of all organisms [3], [4]. For recombinant protein, high levels of production are required. If a technique could be developed to eliminate disturbances in protein expression, this might provide a solution that would permit the large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Many previous studies have been made with the aim of developing efficient techniques for the production of biologically active protein. The approaches including optimization of culture condition [4], [5], coexpression of molecular chaperones [3], and the used of solubility tags such as maltose binding protein (MBP) or glutathione Stransferase (GST) [4] are often used for achieving efficient protein production. These can be effective approaches in conventional protein production. But the genetically method requires the removal of the large tag from either the expressed target proteins or the introduction of a number of the chaperone gene into the host cell. Therefore, the simple and efficient system for enhanced protein expression are required in various fields of research and development. \n\nLate embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a group of the hydrophilic proteins that are found among the families of proteins that are expressed for anhydrobiosis both in plants [6], [7], [8], and in animals [8], [9], [10], [11]. Although a variety of LEA proteins exist, all show has hydrophilic character [12]. Several studies have reported on improvements in the solubility of protein expressed in cell body achieved by utilizing the hydrophilic characteristic of LEA proteins [13], [14], [15].",

In addition, it can form competent cells to take up exogenous genes, and has a good expression and secretion system. In this paper, we discussed the metabolic engineering from the aspects of systematic biology, synthetic biology and evolutionbased engineering. Systematic biology can provide genome-scale information on B. subtilis, which is an important theoretical basis for synthetic biology to design and simplify genes. At the same time, the computational tools of systematic biology simplify the design and optimization of metabolic pathways. Furthermore, simplified genetic systems created using synthetic biology approaches will supply systematic biology with an in-depth understanding of the basics of natural gene regulation. In particular, evolution-based engineering provides mutants which meet production needs. Overall, systems biology increases the understanding of B. subtilis using omics, synthetic biology can be utilized to construct new metabolic regulation networks, and evolution-based engineering enables the adaptive evolution of B. subtilis. Together, these approaches greatly expand the scope of metabolic engineering to efficiently produce a variety of proteins and chemicals.",

            "text": "Therefore, the nonglycosylated protein had to be purified from intracellular compartments. These observations have led to a state in which optimal production of Hc proteins is dependent on the generation of synthetic genes and subsequent product purification from intracellular compartments. Indeed, a new generation botulinum vaccine based on synthetic Hc genes expressed in P. pastoris is being developed by the U.S. army for humans at risk (5). \n\nAn alternative strategy for the expression of such unique recombinant proteins relies on the use of cell-free expression systems (CFES). These systems include all the regulatory elements required for in vitro transcription and translation of a protein from a template DNA (12,18,21). As the cell wall barrier is not present in cell-free systems, the reaction environment can be readily controlled, and different components can be directly added to promote protein folding and solubility (36). Moreover, the open nature of the cell-free system also allows rare tRNAs to be added directly into the reaction mix, enabling efficient expression of AT-rich and codon-biased genes (49). \n\nCell-free systems have the potential for higher productivity than current cellular production systems, since all of the cel-lular resources can be efficiently directed toward production of the recombinant protein. Yet, until recently, only microgram quantities of recombinant protein could be expressed in CFES, mainly due to the rapid elimination of substrates and the accumulation of certain inhibiting by-products (18,22,25). This limitation was overcome by the development of continuous exchange cell-free (CECF) systems. These systems enable the continuous supply of substrates and washing out of low-molecular-weight by-products known to inhibit the expression reaction, allowing for the continuous accumulation of the product in a membrane-separated reaction compartment (45). The use of CECF systems was shown to allow for the prolonged and efficient expression of proteins and to increase the product yield to the mg/ml range (23,26,50,51). More recently, additional improvements were introduced to the field of cell-free biology that reduced costs and made this platform attractive for commercial production, especially for difficult-to-express proteins (8,20,37,46).",

Two important technologies will be included in the discussion, DNA assembly and genome editing. \n\nThe aim of DNA assembly is to artificially create and transplant long length genomes into the reading frame of the experimented creatures. Collectively, there are three types of DNA assembly: techniques based on constrained sequences, editions depending on homologous recombination, HR, and de novo DNA synthesis. Interestingly, considering S. cerevisiae is naturally more capable of being manipulated through HR-dependent means compared to E. colis, the direct utilization of HR offers biologists great convenience. Complementarily, genome editing techniques for yeast are developed. Relevant intricate chemical interactions are considered through such development, but with the help of previously mentioned techniques, some genetic toolbox has already been made for the yeast. Every step involved in creating a protein can be modified now, including the modifications made to promoters, mRNA, and translated proteins. \n\nAdditionally, in order to acquire desirable phenotypes, a large variety of biochemical techniques have been devised in order to promote the selection among libraries of countless mutations and potential traits. \n\nAll in all, the advanced techniques have now allowed synthetic biologists to manipulate functions of the yeast much more conveniently.",

Zymomonas mobilis is a highly efficient ethanol-producing bacterium with a small genome size and desirable industrial characteristics, which makes it a promising chassis for biorefinery and synthetic biology studies. While classical techniques for genetic manipulation are available for Z. mobilis, efficient genetic engineering toolkits enabling rapidly systematic and high-throughput genome editing in Z. mobilis are still lacking.ResultsUsing Cas12a (Cpf1) from Francisella novicida, a recombinant strain with inducible cas12a expression for genome editing was constructed in Z. mobilis ZM4, which can be used to mediate RNA-guided DNA cleavage at targeted genomic loci. gRNAs were then designed targeting the replicons of native plasmids of ZM4 with about 100% curing efficiency for three native plasmids. In addition, CRISPR\u2013Cas12a recombineering was used to promote gene deletion and insertion in one step efficiently and precisely with efficiency up to 90%. Combined with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was also applied to introduce minor nucleotide modification precisely into the genome with high fidelity. Furthermore, the CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was employed to introduce a heterologous lactate dehydrogenase into Z. mobilis with a recombinant lactate-producing strain constructed.ConclusionsThis study applied CRISPR\u2013Cas12a in Z. mobilis and established a genome editing tool for efficient and convenient genome engineering in Z. mobilis including plasmid curing, gene deletion and insertion, as well as nucleotide substitution, which can also be employed for metabolic engineering to help divert the carbon flux from ethanol production to other products such as lactate demonstrated in this work. The CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system established in this study thus provides a versatile and powerful genome-editing tool in Z. mobilis for functional genomic research, strain improvement, as well as synthetic microbial chassis development for economic biochemical production.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most extensively studied living organisms on earth and as such has become an instrumental model system for the understanding of a plethora of gene functions and regulations in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Moreover, E. coli also plays an invaluable role in modern biological engineering and industrial microbiology: it is a very versatile host for the production of heterologous proteins and their mass-production in industrial fermentation systems. Genetically modified E. coli cells are currently used in a wide range of processes, such as vaccine development, bioremediation, production of biofuels and production of immobilized enzymes. Additional biotechnological applications are expected to be developed thanks to the exploitation of modern techniques of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. \n\nTo fully exploit the use of synthetic biology in E. coli, the availability of efficient genome editing systems, also applicable in high-throughput modalities is necessary. Currently, there are three main approaches for manipulation of chromosomal DNA in E. coli, all utilizing phage recombinase-mediated homologous recombination (recombineering), using either the Rac prophage system [1,2] or the three bacteriophage \u03bb Red proteins Exo, Beta, and Gam [3][4][5]. Classically, gene knockout mutants are created by inserting antibiotic resistance markers (or other selection markers) between double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) PCR products derived from the upstream and downstream regions of the target gene. Mutant colonies are isolated in the appropriate selective medium after transformation with linear or circular constructs and, when necessary, the selection marker is subsequently eliminated by counter-selection, leaving a \"scarless\" chromosomal mutation. Court and co-workers elegantly demonstrated that chromosomal gene mutations can be achieved without the need of selection markers and using synthetic single stranded DNAs (ss-DNAs) or ds-DNAs, which anneal to their complementary chromosomal regions during replication and mediate recombination and gene modification [6,7].",

            "text": "Producing biomimetic peptides can be achieved through several synthetic methods, each with unique capabilities and limitations. examples include solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) (Merrifield, 1963), liquid-phase peptide synthesis (lPPS) (Anderson, 1960), native chemical ligation (Ncl) (Dawson et al., 1994), and enzyme-catalyzed peptide synthesis (Stepanov, 1996). these techniques have been thoroughly reviewed in other works (Ullmann & Jakubke, 1999;Nilsson et al., 2005). this review focuses on the production of biomimetic peptides using genetic engineering techniques, which offer advantages in precision, scalability, and functional customization (lin et al., 2024). \n\nGenetic engineering is distinct because it uses recombinant DNA technology to produce biomimetic peptides directly conjugated to proteins within host cells. Unlike other methods that require post-synthesis chemical conjugation, genetic engineering streamlines production by embedding the desired recombinant peptide-protein gene sequence directly into bacterial, yeast, or mammalian cells, which then express precisely structured conjugates with reduced variability and increased scalability (lin et al., 2024). \n\nGenetic engineering stands out for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for highly specific control over peptide sequences and their linkage to target proteins. this control enables fine-tuning of the structure and function, such as targeting specific peptide locations on proteins or incorporating flexible linker regions for optimal folding and biological activity (Gupta et al., 2022;Manissorn et al., 2023). Achieving this level of precision with other synthesis methods is more challenging due to the random nature of chemical conjugation or adsorption, which can interfere with bioactivity or release profiles. \n\nAnother advantage of genetic engineering is scalability. Once the gene encoding the desired peptide-protein conjugate is integrated into an expression system, it is possible to produce large quantities of uniform, high-purity biomimetic peptide conjugates (Domingo-esp\u00edn et al., 2011;tripathi & Shrivastava, 2019). this scalability is particularly beneficial for therapeutic applications, where consistency is essential.",

The applications of systems biology in P. pastoris range from an increased understanding of cell physiology to improving recombinant protein expression have been described (Zahrl et al., 2017). A study by Liu W. et al. (2019a) provided information on methanol metabolism during the expression of P-glycoprotein from the P. pastoris MutS strain and suggested an expression procedure for hard-to-express proteins from P. pastoris. \n\nA novel system was reported for fast and easy expression of recombinant proteins in S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. In S. cerevisiae, the gene needs only the transformation of yeast cells with an unpurified PCR product carrying the gene to be expressed, and in P. pastoris, it needs only the isolation of the plasmid generated in S. cerevisiae and its transformation into this second yeast, thus making this system suitable for HTP studies (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2018). A new, stable, autonomously replicating P. pastoris plasmid vector containing the full-length chromosome 2 centromeric DNA sequence was constructed that exhibits high stability for plasmid retention, facilitating genetic manipulation. This vector has the ability to speed up cloning and HTP screening in P. pastoris, accelerating metabolic and genome engineering and high-level protein expression in this organism (Nakamura et al., 2018). New developments related to the P. pastoris expression system including hosts, vectors, glycosylation pattern, and fermentation technology, as well as strain engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce human-like glycoproteins, and protease deficient strains have been described (Baghban et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In recent years, we have witnessed several advances in the application of synthetic biology to produce biopharmaceuticals in yeast spurred by imaginative ideas and innovative approaches (Figure 4). The production of up to 25 g/L of artemisinic acid, a precursor for the antimalarial artemisinin, in S. cerevisiae demonstrates the power of synthetic biology approaches [9]. Since then, numerous researchers have combined synthetic biology approaches with more traditional metabolic engineering to produce a wide-range of medically-relevant compounds, including opioids, anti-cancer compounds, antimicrobials, antioxidants and even snake venom (Table 1; Figure 5). This section highlights some of these recent developments. \n\nGenes 2018, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 21 concentration, prevent efflux or diffusion of pathway intermediates, prevent interference from competing pathways, reduce intermediate toxicity or spatially separate unwanted side-reactions to allow spontaneous product formation to occur [11]. Synthetic, non-endogenous organelles were recently constructed in S. cerevisiae [41], which represent ideal microcompartments for enzyme function isolated from the host cell machinery. The nanocomparments, based on self-assembling encapsulin proteins from the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, were shown to protect cargo proteins from protease degradation and act as nanoreactors for enzyme function. Synthetic biology technologies are most mature in S. cerevisiae. However, in recent years we have witnessed the development of several new synthetic biology approaches in non-standard yeasts, such as promoter engineering in P. pastoris [42,43], an inducible promoter system in Y. lipolytica [44] and CRISPR/Cas9 in P. pastoris [45]. Deaminase-mediated targeted point mutagenesis (Target AID) was also recently used to improve the efficiency of homologous recombination in K. marxianus, facilitating subsequent introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system [46].",

            "text": "The approaches presented above provide an overview of what is currently possible with well characterised IB platforms, and how a synthetic biology approach would augment both the range and amount of compounds that could be produced, and the rate of progress. For C. reinhardtii, although our ability to manipulate it genetically is advancing rapidly, many limitations remain for effective metabolic engineering. For example, fewer than 100 protein-coding genes from the C. reinhardtii genome have been functionally validated, compared with the approximately 6800 genes that have been characterised experimentally in Arabidopsis thaliana (Koornneef et al., 2004). Additionally, the number of tools to regulate transgene expression (Tables 2  and 3) is small compared with standard IB hosts. There are also the well known complications of integration of transgenes into the nucleus via non-homologous end joining, and extensive gene silencing. A significant additional challenge is the fact that regulatory networks at the genetic, cellular, and metabolic levels in C. reinhardtii are almost completely unexplored, so that attempts at manipulation will be effectively empirical, whereas there are many studies of the interactome of E. coli (Juan et al., 2008) and S. cerevisiae (Ito et al., 2001). Although undoubtedly some of these knowledge gaps for C. reinhardtii will be filled in the near future (as discussed above), it should be noted that no biological chassis evolved to be optimal for scientific research, with extensive engineering required to create today's E. coli strains for routine protein expression (Goel et al., 2012;Buchholz and Collins, 2013). Thus rather than waiting for this to be true for C. reinhardtii, would it be possible to expedite progress by applying current leading concepts, techniques and technologies from synthetic biology? This might lead to quicker solutions to current research questions and, importantly, provide the opportunity to develop C. reinhardtii production systems that exceed the capacity of current metabolic engineering approaches. Adopting standardisation, modularity, and design/testing does not require drastic changes in approach, nor does it render all prior knowledge obsolete. Instead this progression can be achieved by subtle changes to minimise experimental variables and standardise workflows, creating a cycle of perpetual improvement. To demonstrate this, let",

However, the focus of recombinant protein production is to achieve high titers, yields, and productivities in order to reduce the cost of protein production, because although recombinant protein production is now a well-established practice, large-scale production of proteins, particularly for low-cost applications, still remains economically challenging [1]. \n\nRecombinant protein production begins with the integration of recombinant DNA, often from a heterologous source, into the genome of the host organism under the control of protein expression elements. A DNA vector composed of various genetic elements such as the gene of interest, promoters, terminators, reporters, markers, and enhancers is transformed into the host cell using a variety of different transformation methods. Integration into the host cell genome can also be achieved using a variety of mechanisms such as CRISPR-mediated genome editing or random integration, and is largely influenced by the host cell type (bacterial, plant, yeast, cell culture systems) and species. The most used platforms include bacteria (Escherichia coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), mammalian cells (CHO and HEK-293 cells), and baculovirus/insect cells (Sf9, Sf21) [2]. However, proteins with complex post-translational modifications cannot be produced in the highly productive, low-cost bacteria or yeast systems, and therefore, costly cell culture systems are typically employed. Due to their costs, cell cultures systems are typically only used to produce high-value products like biologics. Thus, there remains a gap in the available production systems for the production eukaryotic proteins for low-cost applications like industrial enzymes. \n\nMicroalgae are microorganisms widely distributed throughout natural environments. Due to the low cost of their cultivation (low energy inputs and simple inorganic media), they have garnered interest as a low-cost platform to produce recombinant proteins.",

This Research Topic will help researchers to produce high value compounds of pharmaceutical importance on a commercial scale. Breakthroughs in the synthetic biology, can lead to the synthesis of pharmaceutically important plant metabolites in a tailored fashion, in heterologous systems.",

            "text": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most extensively used biosynthetic systems for the production of diverse bioproducts, especially biotherapeutics and recombinant proteins. Because the expression and insertion of foreign genes are always impaired by the endogenous factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nonproductive procedures, various technologies have been developed to enhance the strength and efficiency of transcription and facilitate gene editing procedures. Thus, the limitations that block heterologous protein secretion have been overcome. Highly efficient promoters responsible for the initiation of transcription and the accurate regulation of expression have been developed that can be precisely regulated with synthetic promoters and double promoter expression systems. Appropriate codon optimization and harmonization for adaption to the genomic codon abundance of S. cerevisiae are expected to further improve the transcription and translation efficiency. Efficient and accurate translocation can be achieved by fusing a specifically designed signal peptide to an upstream foreign gene to facilitate the secretion of newly synthesized proteins. In addition to the widely applied promoter engineering technology and the clear mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway, the innovative genome editing technique CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system) and its derivative tools allow for more precise and efficient gene disruption, site-directed mutation, and foreign gene insertion. This review focuses on sophisticated engineering techniques and emerging genetic technologies developed for the accurate metabolic regulation of the S. cerevisiae expression system.",

            "text": "Almost two hundred years have passed since the birth of synthetic organic chemistry when the German chemist Friedrich W\u20ac ohler, performed the synthesis of urea in 1828 (W\u20ac ohler, 1828). Since then, our understanding of the properties and reactivity of organic molecules and the physical principles that compose living systems has progressed at a strong pace. This accumulation of knowledge over the years helped set the framework for the emergence of modern synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology consists of the manipulation and rationalization of complex biological processes to design or re-purpose biological systems for useful applications (Purnick and Weiss, 2009). As with any engineering device, a certain level of abstraction is necessary to obtain a functional representation of a complex problem. For synthetic biology, the various biological components of the complex problem being investigated are represented in terms of biological parts or devices. These biological parts or devices could be 'plugged-in' to a microbial chassis to address a given need. Once 'plugged-in' to the chassis, these parts begin interacting under the corresponding genetic programme which encodes the target function. \n\nWith the assistance of genetic engineering, synthetic biology has rapidly advanced over the last few years for certain well-characterized organisms such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. However, one major challenge in this area is the dearth of diversity when choosing a platform organism to use as a chassis. \n\nNevertheless, selection of a suitable host system is one of the main determinants of the technology, molecular tools, equipment and reagents needed to perform a chosen project. With the importance of suitable organism selection obvious, the selection should be made with the nature of the desired final product in mind at all times. \n\nThe work by Calero and Nikel (2018) reviews the predominant bacterial expression systems that have been successfully utilized in the field and the preferable properties that an ideal chassis should have for its use as a cell-factory to avoid the non-desirable drawbacks that could occur as a consequence of the expression of heterologous pathways in a given bacterial host. The ability to assemble protein-coding sequences from different organisms into a single circuit would provide synthetic biologists with a considerable degree of flexibility in chassis selection for the design of novel systems.",

            "text": "The advancement in synthetic biology enables reprogramming of microbial cell factories to overproduce recombinant proteins for an array of useful applications. Recombinant protein products of importance generally include growth factors and hormones, antibodies, enzymes and vaccines (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). The market of recombinant proteins is forecasted to grow at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 9.8 and 12.2% (VynZ Research, 2019;MarketsandMarket Inc., 2021). Among those products, growth factors and hormones have the largest market share; growth factors are signaling proteins that regulate cellular processes involving proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and angiogenesis. Recombinant growth factors have been conventionally used as therapeutics for wound healing and diseases, and they increasingly serve as cosmetic additives and as a supplement in serum-free media for cultivated meats (Kim et al., 2021;O'Neill et al., 2021). In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has called on efforts on the development of recombinant protein-based vaccines and therapies. Emerging data suggest that recombinant protein vaccines potentially complement the mRNA and viral vector vaccines (Pollet et al., 2021). \n\nThere is a pressing need to design economically sustainable processes to achieve efficient recombinant protein production (RPP). Bacterial expression systems are commonly employed to address this issue because their genomes are relatively simple to manipulate, they can be cultured in cost-effective media, and the production scheme is easily scalable (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;MarketsandMarket Inc., 2021). Large-scale production of many recombinant proteins remains challenging, especially for those with multiple disulfide bonds or from mammalian origins. The precursor metabolites and energy required to fuel cellular activity and protein biosynthesis come from central metabolic pathways (Papagianni, 2012). However, RPP often perturbs cell physiology as a result of imbalanced carbon flux, energy drain, and impaired global regulation in central and cellular metabolism.",

            "text": "The design of artificial genetic circuits forms the foundation of the synthetic biology. Discovered over the last few decades and still carefully investigated, natural mechanism of gene expression or genome editing are extensively harnessed to build artificial biological systems tailored for purposes, such as recombinant proteins and enzymatic cascades production, or even entire metabolic pathways assembly. The deconstruction and redesign of such mechanisms enable a better understanding of the biochemical principles and further result in more optimised processes. Among all model organisms for synthetic biology the most exploited, due to their relative simplicity and ease of manipulation is Escherichia coli [1]. It is broadly used as a model organisms for metabolic engineering studies [2] and are a well-characterised platforms for the production of recombinant proteins [3,4]. \n\nVarious strategies for the heterologous expression in bacterial hosts are developed, including plasmid-based [5,6] and genome integration [7,8] approaches. In case of synthetic plasmids design different cloning strategies, artificial vectors and genetic parts were developed. Starting from simple restriction enzyme digestion and ligation protocol, through BioBricks assembly [9], Gibson assembly [10], and Golden Gate assembly [11], to the most recent such as CIDAR [12], or Golden Standard Modular Cloning (GS MoClo) [13] assemblies. They offer different levels of complexity of final genetic circuits, including multi-genetic complexes. However, there is still an urgent need for investigations focusing on the independent and steerable co-expression of several genes in one host. Often developing a metabolic pathways or enzymatic cascades, it is crucial to deliver an optimised proportions between involved proteins [14,15]. Apart from utilisation of couples of plasmids with various copy numbers [16] or ribosome binding sites (RBSs) of different strengths [17], the most precise and presumably autonomous control of the expression levels offer regulator/promoter inducible systems. \n\nIn this study we present a set of new plasmids, dedicated for the recombinant expression in E. coli. Plasmids design was based on the recently developed GS MoClo assembly based on Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) [18].",

            "text": "The first tier of synthetic biology focuses on altering the general process flow-specifically modifications to the function and behavior of the process units (transcription [32] and translation) and the associated process streams (DNA, RNA [33], and protein). These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

The biotechnological approaches adopted to improve renewable fuel production are classical mutation, and selection or plant breeding, which includes techniques for selecting the mutant strain that occurs in a natural habitat or by selectively breeding the different variety of strains or plants; directed evolution refers to the process in which the microbial strains are randomly grown under the optimum conditions, mutated under selective pressure and the over performing mutated strains are selected; recombinant DNA technology i.e., fragments of DNA from different species are combined together and inserted into a host organism (microorganism, algae, or plant) to develop a new strain to achieve the desired biochemical function; 5 DNA shuffling is a directed evolution that uses different techniques to connect the genes in a variety of combinations, mutate the gene that encodes the enzyme for desired improvements, and after the beneficial mutation the high performing strains are selected. 5 Metabolic engineering uses the technologies of recombinant DNA to either alter or enhance the existing metabolic pathways, engineer a new pathway in an organism; and Synthetic biology refers to the process of designing and developing new enzymes, biological pathways or even biological systems that do not previously exist in nature. 5 Synthetic biology is considered to be the most ambitious approach to metabolic engineering.",

            "title": "Decoupling Growth and Protein Production in CHO Cells: A Targeted Approach",
            "text": "With the increasing demands on biomanufacturing facilities to produce a wider range of protein biotherapeutics at higher titers and in a shorter period of time, decoupling growth and production provides a viable alternative to traditional constitutive expression strategies. Moving the product expression window away from the growth phase mitigates the negative impact that cytotoxic proteins have on cell growth, viability, and stability. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that recombinant protein expression places a substantial metabolic burden on the cell, particularly on its secretory capacity, resulting in decreased cell line stability and downregulation of recombinant gene expression (Jones et al., 2005;Ong et al., 2019;Poulain et al., 2019). For example, removing the expression of a non-essential recombinant gene substantially improved the growth characteristics of a CHO cell line (Kallehauge et al., 2017). This suggests that decoupling growth and production could have wider application in the production of biotherapeutics, beyond just those that are cytotoxic. \n\nThe application of decoupling strategies in bioproduction has been limited by the variable impact of temperature shifts and chemical agents on product titer, culture viability, and product quality. This is largely due to the interaction of these strategies with many other cellular pathways that are not related to cell proliferation. Although industrially inviable due to their cost, the use of highly selective cancer drugs for proliferation control has yielded promising results for targeted approaches (Du et al., 2015). Synthetic biology offers a potentially more industrially relevant approach, but its use in proliferation control has remained largely unexplored. Here, we have discussed synthetic biology tools that have emerged over the last 20 years that could be used to arrest cell proliferation. Synthetic biology approaches to decoupling growth and production in microbial systems have been developed, but a mammalian cell engineering approach remains largely unexplored. The implementation of such strategies in mammalian cells has considerable advantages over conventional approaches to proliferation control, allowing the selective targeting of cell-cycle regulators to induce cell-cycle arrest (with the associated increase in specific productivity), while avoiding negative impacts on product quality.",

Over the past decades, B. subtilis has comprehensively been developed as a workhorse for the secretory over-production of numerous recombinant proteins and high value-added chemicals that are widely used in industrial biotechnology [1][2][3][4]. Several industrially and pharmaceutically used recombinant proteins are biosynthesized and actively exported into the extracellular milieu, employing powerful genetic elements and native highly efficient secretory translocation systems [5][6][7][8][9][10]. It also naturally produces many valuable biochemicals, such as poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid, riboflavin, surfactants and antimicrobial peptides [11][12][13][14]. After successfully sequencing of the genome of B. subtilis 168 [15], more and more groundbreaking studies focusing on the fundamental sciences, such as biosynthetic pathways, the omics-driven system biology for metabolism [16][17][18], the cell-cell signaling pathway [19], and the mechanisms of controlling key metabolic intersections [20], have been performed. More importantly, booming technologies in B. subtilis, such as the DNA assembly [21], the CRISPR/ Cas9 and ssDNA strategies for genome editing [22][23][24], and large-scale genome reduction [25], etc., provide a great push for developing B. subtilis into an ideal chassis for synthetic biology. \n\nIn synthetic biology, it is generally regarded that the designer functions in living chassis are performed by gene circuits, which directly exert diverse tailor-made devices, such as tunable oscillations [26], Boolean logic [27,28] and pattern formation [29] and so on. These achievements rely on gene circuits of increasing size and complexity so that biological engineers must finely adjust the expression level of many different genes at a time.",

Additionally, synthetic biology is an enabling machinery that aims to increase extrapolative capacity and reconcile involvedness in living systems and may be defined simply as the engineering of biology; driven by technological advances in DNA synthesis, advances in computational methods, and the elucidation of complex heterologous synthesis of biomolecules [253]. Considering this, heterologous protein production in plants would open up for new technologies for developing an efficient and resourceful platform similar to the work on non proteineous biomolecules [254]. In this review, we highlighted the past attempts and recent progress in heterologous protein production in plants and its potential for commercial drug development and production. In conclusion, although plants as production platform face problems for public acceptance, undoubtedly it will definitely find its way into future as the best production platforms with constant support from the government, medical field, companies, and scientific community.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production has led to a revolution in basic research and biotechnology and biotherapeutic industries and plays a key role in the treatment of a wide range of major diseases. Currently, the majority of commercial recombinant proteins are produced using either bacterial or eukaryotic cell expression systems dependent upon the structural complexity and cell-dependent modifications required to obtain functional protein. The Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli is an attractive system for recombinant protein production at both academic and industrial scales. It is not only cheap and easy to culture in batches to high densities, but a wide range of strains, reagents, promoters, and tools have been developed to facilitate the production of functional proteins in E. coli. In addition, the application of synthetic biology strategies is now overcoming limitations commonly associated with the application of post-translational modifications and folding of complex proteins. 1 ere, we describe an innovative expression system that induces packaging of a diverse range of recombinant proteins into membrane vesicles in E. coli. We identify a simple peptide tag that results in high yields of vesicle-packaged functional proteins and allows compartmentalization of otherwise toxic, insoluble, and disulfide bond-containing proteins, as well as extracellular release of vesicles into the media for efficient downstream processing. These released protein-packed vesicles support rapid isolation from the media and also provide a micro-environment for stable, long-term storage of functional recombinant proteins. Thus, this system provides significant benefit for a wide range of applications from discovery science to applied biotechnology and medicine. \n\nMOTIVATION The ability to reprogram a cell to direct the packaging of specific molecules into discrete membrane envelopes is one of the major challenges in the fields of synthetic biology and recombinant protein today. We thus set out to develop a system to allow the export of vesicle-packaged proteins from Escherichia coli.",

            "text": "Hence, CFPS (recently also called TXTL for \"transcription-translation\") is getting more attention these days with the development of new methods that try to make the best use of the unique features of an in vitro method rather than relying on established systems depending on a host cell (Zemella et al., 2015) for synthesis of recombinant proteins. The high potential of new CFPS systems was demonstrated by an E. coli system that is used for protein expression on an industrial scale (Zawada et al., 2011;Salehi et al., 2016;Hershewe et al., 2020). It was suggested that such systems could be used more in the future for the production of dedicated pharma proteins, for example, incorporating noncanonical amino acids (Hong et al., 2014;Quast et al., 2015;Wu et al., 2020), preparation of dedicated proteins that were produced under more defined conditions than possible in cellbased systems (Oza et al., 2015), or allowing for the \"on-demand\" production of protein therapeutics in the clinic (Mohr et al., 2016;Sullivan et al., 2016;Timm et al., 2016). The diverse features of CFPS systems promoted also their recent use in teaching (Stark et al., 2019), protein engineering (Kido et al., 2020), and synthetic biology (Tinafar et al., 2019), which holds great promises for studies on genetic networks or rapid prototyping (Karim et al., 2020) in metabolic engineering (Perez et al., 2016) as well as future drug development (Dondapati et al., 2020). Moreover, the in vitro reaction format of CFPS systems allows for full automation, miniaturization (Ayoubi-Joshaghani et al., 2020), and working with large sample numbers (Zhu et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The concept of synthetic biology was proposed in 1910s by Stephane Le Duc. 1 In this field, research strategies have been changed from the description and analysis of biological events to design and manipulate desired signal/metabolic routes, similar to the already defined organic synthesis. Unlike organic synthesis successfully developed in the early 19 th century, 2 synthetic biology is restricted by DNA, RNA and protein technology within the complexity of biological systems. Today, synthetic biology has been developed extensively. It becomes a multidisciplinary field aims to develop new biological parts, systems, or even individuals based on existing knowledge. Researchers can apply the engineering paradigm to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature. Synthetic biology is tightly connected with many subjects including biotechnology, biomaterials and molecular biology, providing methodology and disciplines to these fields. \n\nThe timeline of synthetic biology developments is summarized here (Fig. 1). In general, the history of synthetic biology can be divided into three stages. The initial stage was found across the 20th century. Although the simplest organisms such as virus particles, bacteria, archaea and fungi were hard to engineer in the 20th century, some achievements were still acquired in the early explorations including the synthesis of crystalline bovine insulin, 3 chemical synthesis of DNA and RNA, 4 decoding of genetic codes 5 and the establishment of central dogma of molecular biology. 6 ynthetic biology has been accumulating its strengths in this period, as knowledge of genome biology and molecular biology are developed rapidly at the end of the 20th century (Fig. 1). \n\nThe development stage begins in the 21 st century. In the first decade of the new millennium, synthetic biology is known to every biological researcher to include inventions of bioswitches, 7 gene circuits based on quorum sensing signals, 8 yeast cell-factory for amorphadiene synthesis 9 (Table 1), BioBrick standardized assembly 10 and the iGEM conferences 11 (Fig. 1). Two principles in synthetic biology designs have been considered in this stage including bottle-up 12 and top-down 13 ones, referring to the de novo creations of artificial lives by assembling basic biological molecules and engineering natural-existed cells to meet actual demands, respectively.",

            "text": "Since the pioneer work of Stanley Cohen, Herbert Boyer and their collaborators almost 40 years ago (Cohen et al., 1973), genetic engineering had advanced greatly. The tools and resources available to the genetic engineer open new opportunities in genome engineering (Carr and Church, 2009) and synthetic biology (Lu et al., 2009). But still much needs to be done to build and control biological systems. In the current Research Topic, we focus on the synthesis of bio-based materials employing the basic principles of genetic engineering. The rationale of utilizing biosynthesis as a route for material production relies on the capability of the biological machinery to produce macromolecules of well-defined sequence, stereochemistry, and size. The specific location of the chemical groups in a given bio-macromolecule is critical to its structure and ultimately its biological function. Protein engineering has emerged as a strong tool to produce proteins in large scale with high fidelity. In the context of the current Research Topic we refer to such protein products as bio/macromolecules, nanostructures, biologicals or precursors produced in a bio-based environment. The topic is designed to present several approaches to biosynthesis, not limited to the production of a target protein in a bacterial host. \n \nAt first, I would like to direct the readers to an opinion article that presents a broad perspective of the field of bio-based and bio-inspired materials (Nick McElhinny and Becker, 2014). Following their theme, most of the articles in the current Research Topic fit in the category of Using Biology as a Material. For example, several original research papers report the utilization of genetically-engineered proteins to obtain materials for various applications such as: tunable hydrogels (Tang and Olsen, 2014), hydrogels for mechanically active tissues (Li and Kiick, 2014), bacterial collagen for tissue engineering (An et al., 2014), and microfibers for nerve guide conduits (Kakinoki et al., 2014). Plant viruses (Pongkwan et al., 2014) and antimicrobial peptides (Rodriguez et al., 2014) are the starting bio-based materials to incorporate new functionalities by well-known chemical methods.

            "text": "Synthetic biology uses a ground-up approach to genetic engineering with a vision to solve the technical and conceptual bottlenecks associated with the field. Standard biological parts have emerged as a mechanism through which researchers can emphasize the engineering component of genetic engineering. To viably implement such a vision, however, a new experimental approach that can systematically identify and optimize biological function is needed. Currently there are no established methodologies to encapsulate biological part function such that meaningful, quantitative predictions about genetic composition can be made a priori. Although in practice post-hoc analyses of projects provide insights into the individual properties of parts, most engineering strategies require either an ad-hoc search of intuitively-chosen constructs or library-based approaches. In the hands of experienced researchers these methods can be quite effective for systems containing up to 6 genes [1]. Nevertheless, beyond this scale these methods appear to be insufficient. We have implemented an alternate approach to experimental design that uncovers optimal solutions to design problems by linking automated DNA fabrication to effective construct screening. In the first step, we use cost effective, fast and scalable DNA fabrication methods to generate large sets of explicit DNA constructs automatically. In the second step, we functionally screen those DNAs via readily available assays that are also automatable, cost effective, fast and scalable. Additionally, we integrate these activities under a software tool chain specifically developed for these types of applications. By linking these functions together into a single process we not only uncover optimal solutions to a design problem, but also encapsulate important data about the parts from which they were composed. In turn, this leads to greater insight and faster optimization.\n\nTo illustrate how this alternate approach can be implemented in a synthetic biology lab we have focused on the production of multi-subunit protein complexes. The ability to produce functional protein from recombinant sources is essential in synthetic biology and for the scientific community at large. Nevertheless, producing these proteins quickly and successfully, particularly in the case of multi-subunit complexes, can be challenging. Given an overall lack of tools available to quickly and effectively identify appropriate conditions a priori, production efforts are often inefficient, resulting in poor or failed attempts. In these cases, original constructs need to be modified, which is often costly, laborintensive and time-consuming, particularly if multiple rounds of",

            "text": "Many innovative approaches stand out for discovery or modification of prokaryotic [94] and eukaryotic [95] promoters. Obviously the identification of bacterial promoters is important to achieve higher yields of recombinant proteins produced in bacterial cell factories. Promoter engineering is a strategy to create large number of promoter libraries and to regulate promoters with different strength and functions. Many studies based on mathematical prediction, randomization of promoter sequences and hybridization of promoters are used for promoter modifications [56]. Although this strategy is one of the main topics of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, it is also practical for overexpression of recombinant proteins. In this regard, bioinformatics serves as a useful tool for discovery of bacterial promoters [96]. Researches on identification and development of novel promoters mainly consist of three strategy: (i) discovery of novel promoters by microbial genome screening [97,98], (ii) constructing of broad libraries of artificial promoters [94,99] and (iii) editing the core region of existing promoters [100]. \n\nSequencing the genomes of different bacteria is an applicable way leading to discovery of novel promoters [101]. For this purpose, transcriptome mining may be a convenient choice as a bioinformatics tool based on genome screening, for identification of novel and stronger promoter(s) from the transcriptome data of the strain of interest. By this approach, Meng et al. [102] reported B. subtilis as an appropriate expression host for the production of pullulanase, a starch hydrolysis enzyme, at industrial quantity. In their study, four strong promoters were identified from B. subtilis transcriptome. New recombinant strains with individual promoters or combinations thereof were generated. Results from the studies on screening of endogenous promoters lead to efficient engineering of strains. Newly identified promoters can effectively optimize the molecular pathways and improve the productivity in strain of interest as well as increasing the industrial protein production [103]. High-throughput promoter screening and identification studies may be useful for developing novel expression system for research and biotechnological applications [104]. \n\nDevelopment of synthetic promoters has also importance for engineering of strains to produce large-scale protein production.",

However, there is still a shortage of manufacturing capacity due to the increasing demand of diverse recombinant proteins, which requires a much better approach in the optimization of production strategies and expression vector design. Efficient strategies for the development of recombinant proteins are becoming particularly important as more applications that demand significant amounts of high-quality proteins enter the industry. Moreover, expressing multiple proteins of diverse nature is the major thrust area to fulfill the goal of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Plasmids are extrachromosomal highly folded circular self-replicating cytoplasmic DNA elements present in most bacteria. Since the advent of genetic engineering, they have been used as molecular vehicles for recombinant genes. Plasmid-based expression is the most common option when expressing genes in prokaryotes [3]. \n\nPlasmids are commonly found in variable copy numbers in bacteria and they inflict a metabolic burden on the host cells, as they utilize the cellular resources for their replication and recombinant protein production. This metabolic burden correlates with plasmid copy number and toxicity of the inducers toward the host, which influence the bacterial growth rate as well as its products [4]. A common observation is that low-and medium-copy plasmids provide much more benefits over high-copy plasmids, such as tighter control of gene expression, the ability to replicate larger genes, and lower metabolic burden on the host cells [5]. Additionally, use of high-copy plasmid to enhance gene expression may rather lead to limitation in gene expression due to plasmid metabolic burden. Moreover, protein expression at very high levels might be harmful and, in this case, low-or medium-copy plasmids may be sufficient or even desirable [6]. For the production of periplasmatically secreted proteins, it was found out that the expression rate should be optimized rather than maximized [7]. \n\nThere are many factors related to the expression vector that influence the recombinant protein production in E. coli.",

The factors that corroborate its value can be attributed to the scientific knowledge obtained from decades of study regarding its biology that has fostered the development of several genetic engineering strategies, such as the use of different plasmids, engineering of constitutive or double promoters, chemical inducers, systems of self-inducing expression with or without a secretion system that uses a signal peptide, and so on. Tools that enrich the technological arsenal of this expression platform improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of production of proteins of biotechnological importance. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the major advances involving recombinant expression systems developed in B. subtilis, thus sustaining the generation of knowledge and its application in future research. It was verified that this bacterium is a model in constant demand and studies of the expression of recombinant proteins on a large scale are increasing in number. As such, it represents a powerful bacterial host for academic research and industrial purposes.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology adopts the principles of electrical engineering to rationally design and engineer biological systems. In the early era of synthetic biology, various genetic circuits were constructed, including a genetic toggle switch and a repressilator, which began the rational design of man-made functional biological networks [1,2]. Recently, synthetic biologists have developed various biotechnological and computational methods and tools to manipulate the host genome and create various synthetic systems using various genetic components, such as DNA [3], RNA [4,5], and proteins [6], as well as complex synthetic circuits, such as bio-oscillators [7], toggle switches [1,8], and logic gates [9]. \n\nSynthetic systems have been widely applied to metabolic engineering for the biosynthesis of biofuels, commodity chemicals, and pharmaceutical molecules [10][11][12][13]. The integration of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering has provided a solution to the current increasing demand for sustainable and renewable resources in response to global concerns, such as fossil fuel depletion and rising healthcare expenses [14,15]. In particular, synthetic biology has provided advanced toolsets and novel systems, which significantly facilitate the development of metabolic engineering [10,16]. \n\nFor example, recently, the metabolic production of artemisinin (widely used as an antimalarial drug) and its precursor, artemisinic acid, was successfully achieved. Since the supply of artemisinic acid from the plant Artemisia annua or via chemical synthesis was insufficient to meet the needs of the market, it was recently produced from the metabolically engineered microbial hosts Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with higher productivity and an economically feasible titer and yield [13,17,18]. Micro-organisms have also been engineered to produce fuels for use as alternative and renewable sources of energy [19,20]. E. coli was metabolically engineered to produce isopropanol by introducing a synthetic metabolic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA to acetone and finally, to isopropanol. The pathway comprises enzymes originating from other bacterial species, namely, acetyl-coenzyme A [CoA] acetytransferase (C.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is concerned with applying the engineering paradigm of systems design to biological systems in order to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago. This inspired attempts to describe biological regulation schemes with mathematical models and to apply circuit analogies from established frameworks in electrical engineering(McAdams & Arkin A,2000). Meanwhile, breakthroughs in genomic research and genetic engineering (e.g., recombinant DNA technology) were supplying the inventory and methods necessary to physically construct and assemble biomolecular parts. As a result, synthetic biology was born with the broad goal of engineering or \u201cwiring\u201d biological circuitry\u2014be it genetic, protein, viral, pathway, or genomic\u2014for manifesting logical forms of cellular control. Synthetic biology, equipped with the engineering-driven approaches of modularization, rationalization, and modeling, has progressed rapidly and generated an ever-increasing suite of genetic devices and biological modules. synthetic biology is seeking to use and expand the mechanisms that control biological organisms using engineering approaches. These approaches will be applied on all scales of biological complexity: from the basic units to novel interactions between these units to novel multi-component modules that generate complex logical behaviour, and even to completely or partially engineered cells(McAdams & Shapiro,1995). Bringing the engineering paradigm to biology will allow us to apply existing biological knowledge to biotechnological problems in a much more rational and systematic way than has previously been possible, and at the same time to expand the scope of what can be achieved this way. The introduction of design principles such as modularity of parts, standardization of parts and devices according to internationally recognized criteria, and the adaptation of available abstract design procedures to biological systems, coupled to novel technological breakthroughs that allow the decoupling of design and fabrication, will fundamentally change our current concepts of how to manipulate biological systems. In this sense, synthetic biology is not primarily a \u201cdiscovery science\u201d, but is ultimately about a new way of making things. By adapting natural biological mechanisms to the requirements of an engineering approach, the possibilities for re-assembling biological systems in a designed way will increase tremendously.

            "text": "Bacterial protein secretion systems are promising technology to enable the modular, on-demand production of such useful recombinant proteins. Harnessing native bacterial secretion mechanisms could simplify protein production in space by eliminating the need for complicated cell lysis and downstream purification steps that otherwise hinder protein production from adoption for resource-limited situations (Reed and Chen, 2013;Burdette et al., 2018). Among the microbial strains extensively studied in synthetic biology, Salmonella species have gained attention for its applications in medicine and pharmaceuticals (Yoon, 2018;Yan et al., 2023) due to their tractability and their high genetic similarity to Escherichia coli, which enables many tools developed in the canonical Gram-negative model system to be successfully transferred with relative ease. The Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) type \u2162 secretion system (T3SS) is a highly efficient tool for recombinant protein secretion (Metcalf et al., 2014;Azam et al., 2016;Metcalf et al., 2016;Song et al., 2017;Burdette et al., 2021;Liang et al., 2023;Burdette et al., 2024). The T3SS, utilized by many Gram-negative bacteria, comprises a needlelike structure known as the injectisome which is natively used to translocate effector proteins from the cytosol directly into eukaryotic hosts, but also functions in the absence of such hosts to secrete heterologous proteins appended to appropriate N-terminal signal sequences in one step to the extracellular space (Green and Mecsas, 2016;Burdette et al., 2018;Lou et al., 2019;Burdette et al., 2024).",

            "text": "The increase in the world population, the advent of new infections and health issues, and the scarcity of natural biological products have spotlighted the importance of recombinant protein technology and its large-scale production in a cost-effective manner. Microalgae have become a significant promising platform with the potential to meet the increasing demand for recombinant proteins and other biologicals. Microalgae are safe organisms that can grow rapidly and are easily cultivated with basic nutrient requirements. Although continuous efforts have led to considerable progress in the algae genetic engineering field, there are still many hurdles to overcome before these microorganisms emerge as a mature expression system. Hence, there is a need to develop efficient expression approaches to exploit microalgae for the production of recombinant proteins at convenient yields. This study aimed to test the ability of the DNA geminiviral vector with Rep-mediated replication to transiently express recombinant proteins in the freshwater microalgal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are representative antigen proteins and growth factor proteins, respectively, that were subcloned in a geminiviral vector and were used for nuclear transformation to transiently express these proteins in C. reinhardtii and C. vulgaris. The results showed that the geminiviral vector allowed the expression of both recombinant proteins in both algal species, with yields at 48 h posttransformation of up to 1.14 \u03bcg/g RBD and 1.61 ng/g FGF in C. vulgaris and 1.61 \u03bcg/g RBD and 1.025 ng/g FGF in C. reinhardtii. Thus, this study provides a proof of concept for the use of DNA viral vectors for the simple, rapid, and efficient production of recombinant proteins that repress the difficulties faced in the genetic transformation of these unicellular green microalgae. This concept opens an avenue to explore and optimize green microalgae as an ideal economically valuable platform for the production of therapeutic and industrially relevant recombinant proteins in shorter time periods with significant",

            "text": "With the advancements of exogenous gene expression and metabolic engineering, synthetic biology technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 have evolved in microorganisms to become the most efficient gene editing methods. Synthetic evolution aims at the progressive mutagenesis/selection of certain DNAs to efficiently produce goods on an industrial scale. The construction of microbial cell factories, particularly using S. cerevisiae as a chassis cell, has the advantage of a fast production cycle, ease of maintenance and manipulation, and suitability for large-scale fermentation to produce chemicals, fuels, or pharmaceuticals in the bioengineering process. The CRISPR/Cas9 system's current molecular \"toolbox\" enables label-free genetic manipulation and a number of quick and effective genetic modifications. These capabilities enable the system to adapt to environmental stresses like high pressure and temperature, ethanol, and high sugar levels in industrial fermentation processes. Base knockouts, insertions, substitutions, control over the expression of heterologous genes, precursor synthesis, and other changes to the carbon flow process all will contribute to the process's improvement. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique facilitates and speeds up the development of metabolic engineering by enabling gene editing and drastically cutting the time required to genetically modify cell factory constructs. Cas9 toxicity and off-target effects are the main drawbacks and challenges of CRISPR/Cas technology. Efforts are being made to reduce off-target effects by sequencing the entire genomes of microbial hosts. The excellent efficiency and specificity of sgRNA might also lessen mismatches. Cas9 toxicity can also be decreased by controlling the amount of intracellular Cas9 that is reached through temporary expression and a weak promoter. The ongoing advancement of novel CRISPR-based synthetic evolution technologies enhances more conventional evolution approaches to hasten the creation of strains and maximize metabolite synthesis.",

            "text": "Molecular Systems Biology 18 September 2007; doi:10.1038/msb4100176 A paradigm shift is underway within the methodology of heterologous protein expression. Specifically, researchers are moving away from conventional techniques of cloning genes from cDNA libraries and moving toward the rational design and de novo synthesis of entire protein-coding sequences from pre-annealed oligonucleotides (Libertini and Di Donato, 1992;Gustafsson et al, 2004). It was the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allowed efficient construction of synthetic genes. Since then, the steadily increasing accuracy and decreasing cost of oligonucleotide synthesis (now as low as $0.10 per base; Carlson, 2003;Carr et al, 2004;Kong et al, 2007, see Figure 1) has created a research environment in which gene synthesis offers three main advantages over molecular cloning: cost efficiency, scope and flexibility of redesign (Libertini and Di Donato, 1992). As a result, the emerging field of synthetic biology is highly motivated to improve this approach, as it seeks to expand the sophistication of human-engineered genetic architectures, leading ultimately to the synthesis of entire genomes (Yount et al, 2000;Smith et al, 2003). \n\nCurrent research into synthetic gene construction has focused largely on improving PCR-based methods. Areas under active investigation include the following: increasing the accuracy of gene products by reducing errors in oligonucleotide construction and PCR synthesis/amplification (Ciccarelli et al, 1991;Young and Dong, 2004), reducing the relatively high cost of post-synthesis sequencing (Young and Dong, 2004), increasing the length of genes that can be synthesized (Kodumal et al, 2004), developing microchip-based technology and/or microfluidic devices that allow for the simultaneous assembly of multiple genes (Tian et al, 2004;Zhou et al, 2004;Kong et al, 2007), and automating the whole pipeline from gene design to synthetic gene screening (Cox et al, 2007).",

However, there is a need to highlight and summarise the latest cell engineering approaches and strategies regarding manipulation of the methanol pathway, co-factor metabolism, transcription modulation, protein folding and secretion, as well as catabolism of alternative carbon sources, as illustrated in Figure 1, and their contribution to K. phaffii's promising future as a robust and highly efficient host for the production of a huge variety of recombinant proteins. \n\nphaffii can perform diverse protein processing and post-translational modifications typical of higher eukaryotes, such as glycosylation and disulphide bond formation [3,13], and it lacks other known disadvantages that are present in bacterial systems (formation of inclusion bodies and presence of endotoxins) or mammalian cell systems (high cultivation and handling costs) [14]. Using this host system, rProt can be produced in either a constitutive or induced manner, depending on the type of promoter used to drive recombinant gene expression. \n\nThe success of K. phaffii for rProt synthesis has been facilitated by strong methanolinducible promoters from the alcohol oxidase genes (alcohol oxidase 1, AOX1, and to a lesser extent, alcohol oxidase 2, AOX2), and also from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter PGAP, which exhibits strong constitutive expression in the presence of glucose and glycerol [15]. Notwithstanding the efficiency, tight control and rProt productivity obtained when using PAOX1 to drive transgene expression, this production system presents some drawbacks associated with methanol utilisation. Indeed, methanol is toxic to cells, inducing cell oxidative stress, and its use comes with a subsequent high oxygen demand for catabolism [16]. Additionally, as methanol is highly flammable, its use can imply safety issues, especially at an industrial scale.",

            "text": "Lately, a pioneer study conducted by LanzaTech, Inc. (Skokie, IL, United States) shows that Clostridium autoethanogenum can convert syngas (consisting of CO 2 , CO, and H 2 ) to acetone and isopropanol, and a pilot-scale fermentation in a 125-L scalable reactor was demonstrated (Liew et al., 2022). These advances have validated the capability of CO 2metabolizing chassis in the fixation of CO 2 and production of value-added chemicals, and these succuss illustrated the everincreasing power of synthetic biology in biotechnology. \n\nCRISPR-Cas systems, the bacterial and archaeal immune systems, have been repurposed as synthetic biology tools for gene editing and regulation (Knott and Doudna, 2018). They have been revolutionizing biotechnology in fundamental ways. Though still in its infant stage, multiple CRISPR-Cas-based synthetic biology tools have been developed for cyanobacteria, acetogens, and methanogens, driving the rising of novel biotechnologies based on CO 2 -metabolizing microbes. Herein, we summarize the current progress of CRISPR-Cas systems in genetically engineering microbial CO 2 -metabolizing chassis, especially cyanobacteria, acetogens, and methanogens, for the conversion of CO 2 to biofuels and value-added products, and we discuss the challenges and future endeavors in developing more efficient synthetic biology tools.",

            "text": "Proteins are now widely produced in diverse microbial cell factories. The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

For instance, Kim et al. took advantage of the structural properties of synthetic spider silk 287,288 and mussel adhesive proteins, which can act as biological adhesives 289,290 , to engineer E. coli with a spidroin-amyloid-mussel foot hybrid protein that can ultimately assemble into a hydrogel with high strength and underwater adhesion 291 . The hybrid protein consisted of a zipper domain from an amyloid protein, a flexible domain from spider silk, and a dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-containing mussel foot protein. This is a great example of how synthetic biology can be used to generate bacterial hosts expressing recombinant proteins with novel or desirable functions and properties, which can be applied to tackle specific manufacturing challenges in space. In addition, methods to spatially control the distribution of microbial cells into hydrogel structures have been developed using a Stereolithographic Apparatus for Microbial (SLAM) Bioprinting 3D printer 292 . Bioresins composed of synthetic polymers were used to contain the microorganisms and mimic extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are fundamental to biofilm formation in nature 293 . The power of this technology was demonstrated by printing engineered Caulobacter crescentus as uranium biosensors within this biomaterial using a uranium responsive promoter fused to GFP and measuring the fluorescence output 292 . This technology could enable genetic engineering of single strains, microbiomes, and biofilms to be used not only for biomanufacturing but also for biomining, biotherapeutics, and bioremediation. \n\nPolymer production and degradation.

            "text": "In recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2]. In addition, due to a lack of appropriate folding-assistance proteins and cofactors that can mediate post-translational modifications, the likelihood of inclusion body formation is considerately high when heterologous proteins are expressed in E. coli [3]. However, continuous endeavors have been devoted to overcome such limitations. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering strategies, there are many solutions that can potentially provide successful expression of soluble recombinant proteins in an E. coli expression system, including choosing a suitable expression host and vector, codon usage, sequence optimization, inducer concentration, expression temperature, fusion technology and co-expression of a chaperone. \n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals have been applied widely particularly in respect of the broader interest in recombinant technology. These proteins are required in sufficient quantities; however, it remains a challenge to obtain enough proteins from natural sources. To express eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, the concept of fusion technology represents an effective method to enhance protein solubility [4]. In a contemporary study, fusion expression vectors provide useful tools to strengthen the solubility and productivity of eukaryotic proteins, including Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A (NusA), Thioredoxin A (Trx) and translation initiation factor 2 domain I (IF2). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that fusion partners like the Fasciola hepatica 8 kDa antigen (Fh8), the E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) and KDPG aldolase (EDA) have emerged with the intent of improving synthetic yields, enhancing solubility and folding processes and simplifying the purification of eukaryotic proteins [3][4][5].",

Synthetic biology applications include the production of heterologous proteins of industrial interest, the engineering of biosynthesis pathways of valuable secondary metabolites, construction of complex orthologous genetic circuits for building biosensors, among several others. The premise behind developing Marchantia as a synthetic biology chassis is that it could serve as a testbed to generate novel functions translatable to crop plants or in Marchantia itself. Vector sets such as the OpenPlant kit for Marchantia (Sauret-Gu \u00a8eto et al., 2020), are compatible with the common syntax for plant synthetic biology (Patron et al., 2015) enabling the flexible combination of standardized parts, such as coding and regulatory regions, and tags. These genetic parts, the socalled Phytobricks, can also be assembled using Type-IIS restriction enzyme cloning in a high-throughput manner using biofoundry capabilities (Cai et al., 2020). \n\nFor protein expression engineering, the chloroplast is a preferred target. For this purpose, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPRs) have the ability to stabilize chloroplast mRNA and confer high expression levels. In Marchantia, PPRs have been using to optimize the hyper-expression, with a yield of up to $15% of total soluble protein obtained for expression of heterologous proteins in the chloroplast (Frangedakis et al., 2021). This combination of chloroplast transformation and PPRs set the foundation for the rapid and scalable production of valuable proteins for therapeutic use among other applications.",

Synthetic biology metabolic engineering has recently been developed for designing synthetic genetic networks for the production of specific cellular functions in host cells [45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. Based on system models and mechanisms in systems biology, synthetic genetic circuits and metabolic engineering pathways can be designed to investigate cellular behaviors [52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63]. These synthetic biological technologies can be employed to investigate the models and mechanisms of systems biology. Discrepancies between the real behavior of synthetic genetic networks and the desired behavior predicted by the models and mechanisms of systems biology can be fed back to modify the models through methodologies of systems synthetic biology and systems metabolic engineering. Based on the role of systems biology (Figure 1), this review describes current developments in bioinformatics, systems synthetic biology, and systems metabolic engineering. It discusses how systems biology can serve as an integrated platform for bioinformatics, systems synthetic biology, and systems metabolic engineering in the future.\n\nBioinformatics is crucial in genome-wide analyses for understanding cell physiology at different cellular levels (i.e., genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome levels) [12,13]. The various disciplines of bioinformatics provide invaluable information on the global cellular status for systems biology, systems synthetic biology, and systems metabolic engineering, as well as a thorough analysis of the cell. Genomic information in bioinformatics represents the whole genetic makeup of the organism [12][13][14][15][16][17], and comparative genomic analysis may contribute to systems synthetic biology or systems metabolic biology for targeting and engineering genetic circuits to create desirable cellular phenotypes. Transcriptome profiling uses DNA microarrays to decipher the expression levels of thousands of genes under various biological conditions [14,15]. The results can be used to select candidate genes for modification based on systematic analysis of regulatory genes in response to genetic variations and environmental changes, or to identify novel factors for the enhancement of heterolog",

While these microorganisms have demonstrated significant potential in biomanufacturing, their industrial application is limited by suboptimal photosynthetic efficiency. Synthetic biology integrates molecular biology, systems biology, and engineering principles to provide a powerful tool for elucidating photosynthetic mechanisms and rationally optimizing photosynthetic platforms. This review summarizes recent advancements in regulating photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and microalgae via synthetic biology, focusing on strategies to enhance light energy absorption, optimize electron transport chains, and improve carbon assimilation. Furthermore, we discuss key challenges in translating these genetic modifications to large-scale bioproduction, highlighting specific bottlenecks in strain stability, metabolic burden, and process scalability. Finally, we propose potential solutions, such as AI-assisted metabolic engineering, synthetic microbial consortia, and next-generation photobioreactor designs, to overcome these limitations. Overall, while synthetic biology holds great promise for enhancing photosynthetic efficiency in cyanobacteria and microalgae, further research is needed to refine genetic strategies and develop scalable production systems.",

One of the main barriers for these approaches is the lack of genetic regulatory elements with ideal characteristics in different organisms. Developments of these synthetic elements has been rapidly boosted in the last few years, fueled mostly by generating of artificial promoters, libraries of ribosome binding site (RBS) or 5'untranslated regions (UTRs), genetic switches, protein degrons, etc. Because of the flexibility of usage and great number of regulatory components accessible, many synthetic biology studies and applications have been conducted in microorganisms utilizing the model Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On the opposite, despite several modular regulatory elements were developed in other microorganisms [1,2], the use of chassis cells such as Bacillus and Streptomyces, has so far been limited in synthetic applications (see Fig. 1). \n\nRecently, Gang et al. reported an operator-based inducible regulatory system (MATE) in Bacillus subtilis which capable of expressing heterologous proteins and fine-tuning of pathway genes when exposed to maltose [7]. This study provides a comprehensive genetic regulatory system in engineering of B. subtills as workhorse for production of valuable proteins in industrial, agriculture and pharmaceutical fields, as well as shows the great potential metabolic engineering in fine-tuning of biosynthetic pathways for chemicals production. B. subtilis has been well-studied as gram-positive model bacterium for a long time, and being routinely used as a biotechnology workhorse to produce enzymes and chemicals. In comparison with popular host cells such as E. coli or S. cerevisiae, one reason for the modest usage of B. subtilis in synthetic biology is the lack of well-characterized, collections of regulatory elements to control gene expression levels stringently and flexibly in different pathways.",

Numerous strategies have been proposed to improve recombinant protein production, including codon optimization of target proteins (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008;Menzella, 2011;Chung and Lee, 2012), screening and construction of a superior host cell (Choi et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2015;Hayat et al., 2018), addition of fusion tags (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006;Young et al., 2012;Hayat et al., 2018), optimization of expression elements (Gustafsson et al., 2012;Eichmann et al., 2019), or the development of high-density fermentation processes (Yee and Blanch, 1992;Zhang et al., 2000;Thongekkaew et al., 2008). Although E. coli is highly amenable to genetic modification and has a clear genetic background, quite many genes of interest (GOIs) were not well-expressed in E. coli. Furthermore, contamination of fermentation processes with other microorganisms or phages is a common problem that requires an urgent solution (Samson et al., 2013;Ou et al., 2020). Developing alternative hosts that possess a distinct spectrum of highly expressed GOIs complementary to E. coli and compatible with the pET expression system is an attractive way to solve this problem (Calero and Nikel, 2019). \n\nVibrio natriegens, a Gram-negative, non-pathogenic marine bacterium (Payne, 1958), is considered the fastest growing freeliving bacterium, with a doubling time between 7 and 10 min under optimal conditions (Eagon, 1962;Weinstock et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2019). Estimates for the number of ribosomes in V. natriegens in the exponential phase suggest around 115,000 per cell, while E. coli is estimated to have only 70,000-90,000 (Des Soye et al., 2018), which partly explains its greater biomass synthesis rate and stronger protein expression ability (Zhu et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field bringing together several different disciplines which include genetic design and engineering, biology, nanotechnology, chemistry and physics. An amalgamation of various fields, different experts have defined synthetic biology differently. However, at its core, synthetic biology centres at design, construction and characterisation of improved or novel biological systems [1]. \n\nMuch of the inspiration for the field is derived from the diversity and complexity of biological cells. Their complexity has paved way to allow for the design and modification of a system's functionality or the addition of a new function. Much of this field relies heavily upon an engineering-driven approach that accelerates the design-build-test loops required for reprogramming existing and constructing new systems [2]. One of the many unique capabilities of synthetic biology lies within this ability. \n\nThis advancement has seen synthetic biology to have broad applications not only in the medical, biofuel, chemicals and biomaterials field but also provides a revolutionary tool in the understanding of basic life sciences. Though synthetic biology is often rooted to its origins in genetic engineering, it is an umbrella term for a much wider field of its own. Genetic engineering in its own right is now a very mature field; however, much of the modern field synthetic biology is in its infancy using lesser understood and, arguably, unreliable methods [3]. \n\nThe first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes [4,5]. Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches [6], pulse generators [7], oscillators [8] and digital logic gates [9]. These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation.",

            "text": "Many efforts have been made to produce recombinant proteins on a large industrial scale. Heterologous protein expression in the platform host by the introduction of the gene of interest is the most promising approach in several aspects. Heterologous expression hosts can overcome the complexities associated with native hosts, such as slow and fastidious growth, limited molecular biology tools, scarce genetic information, and low productivity (Park et al., 2020). Several representative heterologous expression hosts have been used according to their specialized characteristics and product types (Huo et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Kang and Kim, 2021;Pham et al., 2021). For example, Escherichia coli is the most extensively studied and used for heterologous protein expression, as it exhibits rapid growth, ease of genetic manipulation, and high productivity. Bacillus subtilis is another extensively used Gram-positive bacteria that acts as an efficient workhorse for the production of industrial enzymes and pharmaceuticals, having robust growth and good genetic tractability, along with many endogenous proteases. Beyond the microbial hosts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a commonly used eukaryotic host for recombinant protein production due to its recombinant DNA stability, easy genome engineering strategies, and the ability to provide post-translational modifications. Recently, a high-throughput platform for heterologous protein expression for fungal biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in S. cerevisiae, named HEx, was established to successfully produce diverse fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) (Harvey et al., 2018). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the mammalian cell line that dominates the other recombinant protein production hosts because of their capacity to express large and complex recombinant proteins, but genetic engineering and clonal selection are more difficult than microbial hosts. \n\nAmong the potential microbial chassis, the genus Streptomyces, a soil-derived Gram-positive bacterium with a high GC content genome, is an attractive microbial host for heterologous protein expression (Liu et al., 2018a).",

            "text": "Indeed, there have been countless studies demonstrating techniques to enhance the production of protein over the past 40+ years since recombinant DNA technology was first introduced. Besides choosing the right amount and type of inducer, optimal fermentation conditions have been developed to alleviate the reduction of growth rate during overexpression and enhance yield. Increasing stability of the protein product can also overcome the increased protease activity, this in addition to downregulation of protease-specific regulators. On top of the examples described above, an excellent review by Makrides [28] and a more recent review by Rosano [29] have discussed the various niches within which one can dig deeper in order to achieve higher yield and activity of the desired recombinant protein product.\n\nWe note that the majority of these methodologies have targeted either cell-based genetic regulatory structures, the sequence space and alterations of the protein of interest, or the operating policies of the reactors used to cultivate the overproducing cells. These cells, in turn, have typically been monocultures of an optimized host. Rarely have methodologies appeared in which collectives of cells, either monocultures or controlled co-cultures or consortia, and the exogenous signaling thereof are used to produce products such as recombinant proteins. Particularly useful when the engineering of a particular host overburdens its natural regulatory circuitry, cell consortia or collectives provide an interesting alternative. Co-culture and small consortia concepts have recently emerged. Moreover, new methodologies for orthogonal stimulation of genetic circuits can minimize pleiotropic or off-target effects normally accompanying more common chemical inducers. In the sections that follow, we describe efforts to minimally alter the native bacterial signaling processes of quorum sensing and oxidative stress to repurpose E. coli for application in new platforms.",

The variety of hosts used for cell\u2010free extract production has increased, which harnesses the diversity of cellular biosynthetic, protein folding, and posttranslational modification capabilities available. Here we describe a CFPS platform derived from Pichia pastoris, a popular recombinant protein expression host both in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. A novel ribosome biosensor was developed to optimize the cell extract harvest time. Using this biosensor, we identified a potential bottleneck in ribosome content. Therefore, we undertook strain engineering to overexpress global regulators of ribosome biogenesis to increase in vitro protein production. CFPS extracts from the strain overexpressing FHL1 had a three\u2010fold increase in recombinant protein yield compared with those from the wild\u2010type X33 strain. Furthermore, our novel CFPS platform can produce complex therapeutic proteins, as exemplified by the production of human serum albumin to a final yield of 48.1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml \u22121. Therefore, this study not only adds to the growing number of CFPS systems from diverse organisms but also provides a blueprint for rapidly engineering new strains with increased productivity in vitro that could be applied to other organisms.",

            "text": "In order to solve this problem, highyielding Streptomyces-based CFPS systems were recently developed with the goal to express high GC-content genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of PKs and NRPs [58e60]. The Streptomyces-based CFPS system showed a significant increase of the solubility of high GC genes-encoded proteins as compared to an E. coli-based CFPS system, demonstrating the Streptomyces CFPS system is beneficial for the expression of GC-rich genes [58]. However, current protein yields with the Streptomyces-based CFPS system (<200 mg/mL) remain lower than the E. coli CFPS system (>1000 mg/mL) [60]. In order to enhance the productivity of the Streptomyces CFPS system, further efforts need to be taken to improve the overall protein yields through physicochemical optimization, bioprocess engineering, and strain engineering strategies. Taken together, we envision that CFPS systems, especially, the newly established Streptomyces CFPS platforms, will contribute significantly to express complex natural product gene clusters (e.g., PKS and NRPS) from various Streptomyces species, enabling the synthesis and discovery of novel natural products in vitro. \n\nIn summary, we believe cell-free synthetic biology will play more and more important roles in the next-generation biomanufacturing. Given the flexibility of cell-free systems, biosynthesis beyond the cell holds tremendous potential to create affordable and efficient in vitro artificial biosynthetic factories for the rapid synthesis, study, and discovery of pharmaceutical natural products.",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated again the use of a systems synthetic biology approach to enhance rAAV productivity in a synthetic cell line.The system can be readily adapted for the production of rAAV with different therapeutic genes or of different serotypes.In our earlier studies, upon establishing a cell line, we characterized the viral vector production, identified factors limiting productivity, and devised an approach to reconstructed new producer cell lines from scratch.\n\nIn this work, we took current producing cell lines and attempted to vanquish the limiting factors.In this case, more copies of the PM or the cap gene were integrated into the host genome to boost productivity.During the screening of clones, we used cell sorting to isolate those with more copies of integrated PM, as indicated by the intensity of the reporter gene, in spite of the possibility of an overabundance of capsids and a high representation of empty particles.\n\nWhen that indeed happened, we tuned induction conditions to attenuate the level of capsids, allowing for a balance between productivity and product quality.Through controlling expression levels and timing of cap gene expression, the inducible cell lines produced rAAV with high full particle content without a drop in total filled particle titers.\n\nIn this series of work, we have progressed from initial producer cells generating 1 VG per cell to current 10 5 VG per cell using a model cargo gene encoding GFP.The steps we have taken are summarized in Figure S9 for the benefit of those who will take this synthetic route for rAAV production.In constructing new rAAV producer cell lines, the protocol would resemble that for constructing a hyperproducing cell line of a recombinant protein therapeutic.One would first design the three genetic modules, followed by devising transfection conditions that could yield high copy numbers of different modules integrated into the cell genome as in the level of GX cell lines.Ideally the copy number of cap gene should be high.Unlike the cell line development for therapeutic proteins, assessing rAAV productivity and optimizing the induction conditions will likely extend the timeline by days or even a couple of weeks.Critical to our synthetic approach was the establishment of an assay cell line for efficient high producer cell isolation.

The availability of a genetic map, gene exchange system, useful vector and transformation procedures, and metabolic pathways leading from raw material to the desired product are essential criteria for selecting a suitable host strain. The most popular organisms used to date for the expression of the recombinant proteins are E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Streptomyces spp, Corynebacterium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha and various animal/plant cells. E. coli remains an important host system for the industrial protein production from cloned genes as one of the main applications of genetic engineering in biotechnology. Various efficient expression vector systems have been developed, and a variety of mutants are available as host strains for different purposes [92,93]. Overexpression of a heterologous protein is possible in E. coli, making it suitable for industrial production. Fermentation DOE is an essential tool for basic research that greatly facilitates efficient purification and analysis of such proteins [94]. \n\nFor the successful production of the recombinant protein-based vaccine, producing biologically active protein is an essential requirement that can be further scaled up. Production of a biologically active recombinant protein depends on the host cell's microenvironment for expression and compatibility of codon usage. E. coli has been a widely used expression host for the high-level production of heterologous protein. Differences in usage of codons in prokaryotes (E. coli) and eukaryotes Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) can substantially impact heterologous protein production. The compatibility of codon usage can significantly increase protein expression [95,96]. Moreover, the presence of rare codons in cloned genes affects protein expression level and mRNA & plasmid stability. The excessive presence of rare codons may result in ribosome stalling, slow translation errors [96,97]. In some cases, rare codons inhibit protein synthesis and cell growth [98].",

In this manner, SynBio not only seeks to develop novel biological parts, systems, or devices but also to redesign existing systems [79,80]. Particularly, in plant science, SynBio is being promoted as a promising tool for overcoming challenges related to food security, climate change resilience, energy, and the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals, or even space colonization [55,81,82]. \n\nMany plant transformation techniques apply approaches that could be considered analogous to SynBio, even if they do not use the term, and the application of SynBio design principles could aid the design of more efficient transformation protocols. For instance, the first reported polycistronic system producing multiple gRNA by harnessing the endogenous tRNA processing machinery (tRNA-gRNA system) was reported in plants [83], while previous polycistronic gRNA strategies developed in human cells were based on intercalating 28-nt that were recognized and cut by the co-expressed Csy4 RNase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [84,85]; this tRNA-gRNA took advantage of the robust, endogenous t-RNA processing machinery without requiring the co-expression of endonucleases [83], creating in this manner a novel and more efficient GE system. As discussed in previous sections, SynBio strategies based on mobile RNAs [23], engineered viral systems [59,86], ectopic expression of morphogenic factors [22], and pollen magnetofection [47] have been used for either plant transformation or gene editing without requiring tissue culture steps. While these approaches have been used independently of each other, there is significant potential for developing coordinated or combinatorial systems to improve efficiency. For instance, by combining transient viral-based strategies either with new mobile mRNA systems or with DRs for de novo meristem induction.",

These recombinant protein drugs are generally produced in microbes such as E. coli, yeasts or mammalian cell lines such as Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells. The latter, in particular, are associated with extremely high cost of production, mostly due to complex growth media composition (US$10 -500/L) . Therefore, in the last two decades, an increasing research effort has been put into developing robust, alternative production hosts. Plant and algae-based expression systems are envisioned as a valid, low-cost solution for producing therapeutics in countries and areas that lack resources for costly mammalian-based fermentation systems (Taunt et al., 2018), with the advantage of being immune to most pathogens and contaminations that affect animal hosts (Specht and Mayfield, 2014). In this search, it has been demonstrated the suitability of C. reinhardtii to produce -predominantly in the chloroplast -functional recombinant therapeutics, including a fully assembled human antibody, immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Tran et al., 2009), vaccine subunits (Gregory et al., 2013), vaccine antigens (Demurtas et al., 2013), immunoconjugated cytotoxins for cancer targeted treatments (Tran et al., 2013), and single domain antibodies (VHH) (Barrera et al., 2015).

Johnston et al. 38 recently developed an on-demand production platform that utilized functionalized pluronic hydrogels, featuring temperature-responsive and shear-thinning properties to enable homogenous cell distribution and extrudability, respectively. The mechanical robustness of these gels provided protection from cryopreservation stress for both bacteria and yeast cells. Furthermore, the platform versatility was demonstrated through both continuous and on-demand production of a wide range of valueadded compounds from both mono-and cocultures, including L-DOPA, 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, colicin V, and betaxanthins. The ability to physically separate cocultures within separate hydrogels enabled facile manipulation of consortium population dynamics, minimizing needs for genetically encoded mutualism. Building off of this technique, Yuan et al. 39 recently demonstrated portable, reusable, on-demand production of recombinant proteins up to 150 kDa from encapsulated P. pastoris cells via the Bioproduced Proteins On Demand (Bio-POD) platform. Importantly, these cell-laden material platforms are resilient to lyophilization, thus allowing for ambient storage and simple on-demand production. This feature is especially important for the case of recombinant protein production, typically marked by rigorous cold-chain requirements. Also, the capacity for encapsulation to enhance organism stability could be translated to production systems involving nonconventional hosts to expand the range of cell types applicable for production in outside-the-lab settings. Across the board, a major challenge still remains in the interfacing of these synthetic biology platforms with proper downstream purification modules, although some progress has been made in automated purification module systems 33,40 .\n\nAs highlighted earlier, on-demand and continuous bioproduction requires the preservation of metabolic activity in diverse settings.

            "text": "Re-engineering of complex biological systems (CBS) is an important goal for applications in synthetic biology. Efforts have been made to simplify CBS by refactoring a large number of genes with rearranged polycistrons and synthetic regulatory circuits. Here, a posttranslational protein-splicing strategy derived from RNA viruses was exploited to minimize gene numbers of the classic nitrogenase system, where the expression stoichiometry is particularly important. Operon-based nif genes from Klebsiella oxytoca were regrouped into giant genes either by fusing genes together or by expressing polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved with Tobacco Etch Virus protease. After several rounds of selection based on protein expression levels and tolerance toward a remnant C-terminal ENLYFQ-tail, a system with only five giant genes showed optimal nitrogenase activity and supported diazotrophic growth of Escherichia coli. This study provides an approach for efficient translation from an operonbased system into a polyprotein-based assembly that has the potential for portable and stoichiometric expression of the complex nitrogenase system in eukaryotic organisms. \n\nnitrogen fixation | polyprotein | synthetic biology C omplex biological systems (CBS) encode useful functions of interest for biotechnology, including nutrient assimilation, metabolic pathways, and natural product biosynthesis (1). However, genetic engineering of such systems with large numbers of genetic components is difficult, particularly when there is a stoichiometric requirement for balanced expression of the encoded protein components. To date, one approach toward engineering CBS has involved the complete refactoring of each individual gene in which all of the original native regulatory components have been removed (2)(3)(4). The disadvantage of this approach is the increased fragility of refactored systems, particularly in cases where there is an essential requirement to maintain stoichiometry of the protein-encoded components. An alternative approach is to reassemble the system as polycistronic modules, which maintain protein complex stoichiometry (5). However, large polycistronic operons cannot easily be utilized to express bacterial CBS in eukaryotic cells.",

            "text": "Proteins are naturally produced in all cells to carry out a wide range of biological functions. Controlling their production can meet needs across various societal sectors, including health, environment, energy, and food. Since the advent of synthetic biology about twenty years ago, it has become relatively easy to modify a living cell to produce a desired protein. However, cellular production comes with significant challenges, especially regarding the integrity of the cell. For the past decade, it has been possible to overcome these cellular constraints by using minimal cell-free systems, which contain only the essential components needed for protein production. Industrializing these cell-free systems would greatly help in addressing the challenges of today and tomorrow, and cell-free protein synthesis systems (CFPSs) are now well established into robust platforms not only to synthetize a wide variety of compounds but also bioactive ones [1][2][3][4] . The increasing availability of commercialized cell-free and substrates renders it easier to make a CFPS platform accessible to any research laboratory. However, its widespread adoption is hampered by the need to further develop various tools to streamline and automatize the process. This encompasses the ability to accurately assess protein yields, select an appropriate acellular matrix, and optimize assembly of CFPS components 1,4,5 . \n\nOver the last decade, in addition to advances in cell-free techniques, synthetic biology has seen its methods becoming automated within platforms. These platforms, not limited to any specific equipment, bring together in a unique place all the necessary tools to carry out a project. In 2019, a world-wide coordination has created the Global Biofoundries Alliance that currently encompasses more than 30 academic biofoundries all over the world 15 . Biofoundries are dedicated to advancing and expediting research in the fields of engineering and synthetic biology for both academic and practical applications. They support this by leveraging automation, high-throughput technologies, process upscaling, computer-aided design tools, and innovative methodologies. The use of iterative Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycles in biological engineering empowers researchers to evaluate extensive genetic constructs and utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to refine the design processes.",

More MMNPs can be generated to enable structural elucidation, activity investigation, and potentially clinical trials, thanks to advancements in microbial cultivation and fermentation technology. Ordinary people, on the other hand, cannot afford the therapeutic cost of MMNPs due to their higher manufacture cost. In addition, a growing number of MMNPs found through genome or environmental DNA sequence mining are awaiting confirmation. With synthetic biology's rapid advancement, it could be a potential technique for improving the production of recognized chemicals or activating silent gene clusters. Because of the rapid advancement of synthetic biology, it may be a potential technique for improving health. The development of genome-wide genetic manipulation techniques such as hierarchical conjugative assembly genome engineering (CAGE) [81] and multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) [82] is based on the development of genome-wide genetic manipulation techniques, and synthetic biology can create natural or artificial biosynthetic pathways in the host microorganisms for MMNPs using plentiful genetic resources (e.g., functional genes taken from many sources, controlled regulatory elements [74,83], and synthetic RNA/protein scaffolds [75,76]). Given the triumphs of synthetic biology, the high yields of erythromycin precursor 6-deoxy-erythronolide B, taxol precursor taxadiene, and artemisinin precursor amorphadiene in surrogate hosts [77,78] are the finest examples, indicating its enormous potential for the creation of useful MMNPs. Compatibility between host microbes and synthetic materials of the intended product, including pathway gene expression, enzyme activity, and precursor supply, are essential concerns for host selection in synthetic biology, in addition to efficient DNA manipulation and transfer methods. Although the production of NPs is quite similar in terrestrial and marine microbes, developing marinederived hosts (e.g., marine-derived cyanobacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi) will be useful in the quest for heterologous MMNP expression.

            "text": "The historical development of systems and synthetic biology tools enabled a transition from methods exclusively available for model organisms to their expansion to non-canonical microbial species (Fig. 3). The advent of omics technologies in the 1990s and early 2000s enabled the systematic investigation of living systems as a whole, leading to the emergence of systems biology as a standalone discipline 56 . This has been facilitated by using model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae. In fact, as these species are abundant human commensals 57 , they have been used as models in biology since the first half of the 20th century 58 . Therefore, they represented ideal platforms around which to develop system biology tools, as our understanding of their genetics and physiology was already quite advanced. \n\nThe field of genetic engineering is considered to have started in the 1970s with the first recombinant DNA technologies. In particular, this decade was pivotal for reaching important milestones in molecular biology, such as the use of restriction enzymes, DNA recombination, and DNA sequencing 59 . The genome editing revolution brought on by CRISPR-based genetic engineering in the mid 2010s 60 significantly accelerated the synthetic biology revolution. This breakthrough was also initiated in the two abovementioned model species, with first landmark works on the topic published in the early 2010s 61,62 . From that moment onwards, scientists have been able to investigate and engineer biological systems in an unprecedented way, expanding the use of CRISPR-Cas tools also to non-model species 39,40,63,64 (Fig. 3). \n\nBoth E. coli and S. cerevisiae rely on a polytrophic lifestyle. Therefore, exploiting those organisms for method development has clear advantages, as it relies on energetic carbon feedstocks, which enable fast growth and hence increase the speed of technological development. Moreover, since the dawn of molecular biology, many genetic elements (e.g. plasmids, origin of replications, promoters, ribosome binding sites, etc.) have been characterized for these species. All this caused the establishment and validation of most new protocols and genetic engineering approaches using these organisms. Conversely, newly isolated microorganisms pose a challenge in terms of genetic manipulation and have much less characterized genetic parts.",

            "text": "Genetic engineering of microbes has diverse applications in biotechnology, enabling improved and valuable products for human consumption, industrial applications and therapeutic solutions. Significant advances have been made from rational gene over-expression and the introduction of heterologous genes with fine control of gene expression and modulating the regulatory networks of the host cell (Jensen and Hammer, 1998;Solem and Jensen, 2002). Over the years, the integration of systems biology and synthetic biology has allowed for the development of high performing cell factories. The production of proteins and chemicals have proven to be economical and environmentally sustainable by endowing desirable properties on microorganisms by rerouting existing metabolic pathways or introducing entirely new ones (Lee et al., 2012). In order to exploit cell factories for efficient heterologous expression, optimization of the properties of the strains and enabling secretion of proteins into the culture media at high efficiency are important. It is also critical to understand the complex molecular mechanisms of the cells in order to fully harness the technology in delivering the desired phenotypes and products. \n\nChallenges remain in rational engineering of hosts for improved protein production and secretion, as protein synthesis is a complex machinery, and multi-level cellular processes must be well coordinated to achieve high-yield production and secretion. Incorporating traditional techniques like random mutagenesis and screening is again becoming an alternative to rational engineering. This technique involves introducing random mutations into the genome of the cell to construct a cell library with diverse phenotypic variations followed by screening for a desired phenotype. Due to the random nature of mutagenesis, a high throughput screening technology capable of screening about 10 6 -10 8 mutants is required for screening a large cell library efficiently (Derkx et al., 2014). \n\nDroplet-based microfluidics (DBM) is an emerging highthroughput technology with a lot of potential for screening large sets of mutant libraries individually (Chen et al., 2017). The platform generates compartments of volumes as low as femtolitres and perform reactions individually at the single cell level enabling rapid screening (Seemann et al., 2012). Monodisperse water-in-oil droplets (media containing cells enclosed by oil) are generated with tunable size at a high frequency in a microfluidic chip.",

(2020) used CRISPR/Cas9-based rational engineering of the RUT-C30 strain to increase protein secretion and \u03b2-glucosidase (72-fold) and xylanase (42-fold) activities in the secretome. Implemented changes included the constitutive expression of a mutant of the cellulase master regulator XYR1, heterologous expression of the TeCel3A BGL from T. emersonii, and deletion of genes encoding for the cellulase repressor ACE1 and the proteases SLP1 and PEP1. By combining CRISPR/Cas9 technologies with an exquisite genetic toolbox, Rantasalo et al. (2019) have developed versatile T. reesei-based expression systems that allow rapid construction of recombinant strains that produce high levels of secreted protein using glucose as a carbon source.",

New biological parts (genes, promoter sequence, terminators, etc.), devices (gene networks), and modules (biosynthetic pathways) are only limited by our imagination and the drive to create them. Also, without the advancement of methods for analyzing large amounts of data, bioinformatics, codon optimization software, genome mining, and user-friendly databases, synthetic biology creations are permeating in many laboratories around the world. With this in mind, we will review the current technologies for synthetic genes and genomes, and how this technology can be applied in generating novel regulatory circuits and even whole genomes. In this regard, E. coli is the key organism for such endeavors. Why? Well, in this section, we provide some examples that we consider may be helpful in the future of mankind and are in our opinion relevant in the field of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology is a relatively new branch of molecular genetics that incorporate engineering principles for modifying several aspects of cell physiology, rewiring genetic circuits, creating novel circuits, and synthesizing custom-made DNA sequences and even genomes [87]. This particular branch of biology needs to be supported by an extensive knowledge of the organism that modifications or even whole genome synthesis is attempted, several novel tools for analyzing big datasets and molecular tools for that particular organism, for the generation of sequences and the computational design of DNA molecules, and a goal that can be achieved with the desired organism. E. coli along with Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the most studied and well-comprehended organisms in science, and diverse phenotypes have been identified that are helpful for bioengineering [88,89]. \n\nMultiplexing is the novel approach for redesigning organisms to do desired tasks [90]. By cycling through design-build-test framework we can achieve novel features in existing proteins and can further the advancement of genetic engineering. Thus far the most complicated and time-consuming part of this framework is the testing of the novel designs.",

            "text": "Successful recombinant protein expression and purification is frequently indispensable for both basic research studies and biotechnological and commercial applications [166]. Highthroughput protein expression and purification in E. coli has begun to revolutionize the manner in which studies are conducted in various research fields. Experiments that were typically performed manually to address one protein at a time over a period of several weeks can now be conducted for hundreds of proteins in as little as one week. However, limitations still exist and further improvements are possible. In terms of obtaining target genes, in silico design followed by array-based de novo synthesis rather than PCR may become widely used in the future. The major challenges associated with de novo synthesis are sequence errors, availability and cost. However, if array-based gene synthesis can be commercialized, the costs could decrease by 3-5 orders of magnitude to 10 3 -10 5 bp per dollar [25].\n\nCloning methods have seen rapid advances, and cloning systems used in both commercial and academic settings can be operated with high efficiency, fidelity and reliability, and at a reasonably low cost. The first requirement is to develop a highly flexible expression vector that is fully compatible with high-throughput procedures. An optimal vector must contain a strong but tunable promoter and tags with optimized N-terminal codons to facilitate protein expression, solubility and purification. Large N-terminal tags have been used to enhance translational initiation and promote solubility. However, the cleavage of these large tags may complicate the experiment being conducted and substantially add to the final cost compared to the use of short tags. Given that the downstream costs of testing the functions of individual proteins are often far higher than protein production costs, the cost will probably not dramatically affect experimental workflows. Moreover, new tags are being developed, but considerable room for improvement remains.\n\nCurrently, certain post-translational modifications can be achieved in E. coli by coexpressing the corresponding enzymes. However, such coexpression invariably affects the growth rate of E. coli, and several vectors cannot be readily coexpressed in a single strain. One solution is to integrate genes encoding post-translational modification factors into the genome to create 'eukaryotic-like' E. coli.

            "text": "Numerous useful recombinant proteins, such as antigens, antibodies, and enzymes, are produced using expression systems in Escherichia coli, yeast, insect cells, and mammalian cells for industrial, medical, and research purposes [1]. Recently, recombinant protein production systems using plants have emerged owing to their various advantages, such as low potential for contamination with endotoxins and commensal pathogens, ease of scale-up, and low upstream production costs [2,3]. However, their limitations include a low recombinant protein yield and high purification costs [4][5][6]. \n\nSeveral strategies have been developed to increase the efficiency of plant-based recombinant protein production. First, a viral expression system is used. Viral vectors can be engineered to eliminate virulence and deliver target genes into the cell for expression, as viruses infiltrate host cells and replicate using the replication machinery of the host cell [7]. For example, the magnICON system uses the RNA replication systems of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and potato virus X (PVX), and the in-plant activation (INPACT) expression system uses the DNA replication system of geminivirus, a DNA virus [7,8]. Second, coexpression of virus-induced gene silencing suppressors, such as P19 from tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and P25 from PVX, is also used [9]. Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) prevents externally introduced genes from being transcribed [10,11], and virusderived proteins such as P19 and P25 can increase gene expression by acting as suppressors during this process [11,12]. Third, codon optimization of the target gene matches the codon usage in the host [13,14]. Fourth, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains can increase the target protein yield. However, the efficiency of transgene expression by various Agrobacterium strains varies depending on the plant species and expression system; for example, the GV3101 strain shows higher expression efficiency than the LBA4404 strain in Nicotiana benthamiana [15].",

            "text": "Recombinant protein synthesis is the process of producing proteins in prokaryotic microorganisms or eukaryotic cells using recombinant DNA technology, and it is an important branch of the emerging synthetic biology. It is because of the development of recombinant DNA technology that people can produce a large number of protein products for research or treatment. Historical experience has continuously proved that the manufacture of a key protein molecule can quickly promote the rapid development of related fields, such as recombinant human insulin and recombinant human growth factors. \n\nAt present, the biggest bottleneck of recombinant protein manufacturing technology lies in \"manufacturing\". The first difficulty is whether the target proteins can be expressed in large quantities by microorganisms or cells, and the second is how to obtain high-quality and active proteins through a series of processes and purification. Nowadays, expression systems such as E. coli, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, transgenic plants and transgenic animals are often used to obtain recombinant proteins. Here we take E. coli as an example to introduce the expression process of the target proteins. Firstly, the target gene was determined and suitable vectors (Table 3) and competent cells (Table 4) were selected, then the target gene was linked to an empty vector to construct a recombinant expression vector, and then the recombinant vector was transformed into host cells for culture. When OD 600 reaches 0.4-0.6, an appropriate proportion of inducer was added to induce protein expression at a certain temperature, and finally the thalli were collected for purification (Figure 2). As an expression host, E. coli has become one of the best hosts for the production of recombinant proteins due to its rapid reproduction, low costs, and rapid expression of a large amount of target proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to avoid the influence of lack of post-translational modification systems, inclusion body formation, frameshift mutations and endotoxin production on subsequent purification, several means such as changing host, vector and target gene sequence constantly, optimizing culture conditions, and co-expressing target proteins with molecular chaperones are adopted by researchers to increase protein solubility and expression (Gopal and Kumar, 2013).",

Several hormones, antibody subunits, vaccines, enzymes, and interferons are being produced at the industrial level, in suitable expression systems, under optimized conditions. For recombinant protein production, a range of expression systems are available such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant cells, insects and animal cells, etc. Each recombinant protein has different nature due to which it requires different challenges regarding the expression system and production conditions. Every expression system has its advantages and limitations on the basis of which it can be considered or rejected for a particular protein production. Therefore, it is very significant to investigate the potential and limitations of several expression systems to choose the suitable one for particular protein production at an industrial scale. The optimization criteria of an expression system is evaluated on several factors such as productivity, efficiency, physiological characteristics, total cost, safety, convenience, and down-streaming conditions. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remained the organisms of choice to produce recombinant proteins for a long time, but now several other microorganisms are also being targeted to evaluate their efficiency toward recombinant protein production. Prokaryotic expression systems can be used to produce eukaryotic proteins as well however, the use of a eukaryotic expression system is preferable because it retains the structural, functional, and regulatory properties of therapeutic proteins. This review illustrates a brief view of a variety of expression systems, their efficiency, and limitations in recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "The inducible Pm promoter together with its cognate positive regulator XylS display many favourable properties that makes the XylS/Pm system highly valuable for different applications related to recombinant gene expression. The cassette can be used in a wide range of different Gram-negative bacteria and it was recently also demonstrated to function in Gram-positive organisms further extending the range of its potential applications. The system is characterized by the simple mode of regulation which can be achieved by using different inducers which are typically non-metabolized by a host and enter passively to the cells. These properties together with a dose-dependent induction response and low background expression in the absence of inducer make this expression system highly flexible for both high-level protein production and metabolic engineering in many host organisms. Synthetic biology continuously raises increasing need for useful expression systems, enabling fine-tuned expression of genes and gene cluster around physiologically relevant levels. Ongoing bioprospecting and advanced genetic engineering aim to generate synthetic gene clusters for microbial production of complex chemicals, such as antibiotics, biopolymers and terpenoids, for various medical and industrial applications. To fully explore the potential of such approaches, genetic tools enabling the functional expression of the desired genes in the preferred microbial host will be crucial. The combinatorial mutagenesis efforts made to improve and expand the properties of XylS/Pm have provided better tools for such purposes, and the technologies used to improve this particular system, as presented here, have great potentials to be used for alternative bacterial expression systems.",

            "text": "Efficient genetic modification technology and mature genetic manipulation tools greatly facilitate the development of cell factories. As an important industrial microorganism, A. oryzae has attracted widespread attention from researchers due to its complete genome sequence, powerful secretion of proteins, and increasingly mature synthetic biology tools [79,95]. This review has provided an overview of prevalent synthetic biology tools, genetic engineering methodologies, and heterologous expression systems used for A. oryzae. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed. \n\n(1) DNA assembly is one of the limiting factors for the rapid development of a synthetic biology toolkit for A. oryzae, overcoming limitations associated with long or multiple fragments and scarred DNA after ligation. Enhanced cloning strategies and DNA assembly techniques are essential for the swift construction of gene expression cassettes. Recently, several biotechnology methods for the genetic modification of filamentous fungi, such as the Modular Cloning system or the Golden Braid-based Fungal Braid system, have been used to assemble strains more quickly in a standardized and modular manner. These methods have potential application value in A. oryzae [96,97]. In the future, it is necessary to vigorously develop improved cloning strategies and DNA assembly techniques, to enable faster and more efficient construction of multiple gene expression cassettes. (2) Promoters and terminators are the most important basic elements in synthetic biology research. To date, several gene expression control elements available for A. oryzae have been identified. However, compared with the model microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such elements are still rare. It is necessary to construct promoters with shorter sequences, stronger functions, and wider ranges of transcriptional activity to further explore new synthetic biological elements. (3) Gene editing technology has accomplished rapid editing of A. oryzae with the advantages of simplicity, high efficiency, and high specificity and accelerated the development of engineered strains. CRISPR/Cas9 systems must address off-target effects and improve the efficiency and enhancement of the efficiency of precisely targeted editing, among other aspects.",

Its main aim is to increase the ease and efficiency with which biological systems can be designed, constructed, and characterized. Core efforts in the field have focused on the development of tools to support this goal, including new approaches to biological design and fabrication. Although the first generation of synthetic systems demon strated genetic circuits that encode dynamic behavior, cellular computational operations, and bio logical communication channels, more recent research has focused on implementing synthetic biological devices and systems in diverse applications, including disease therapy, environmental remediation, and biosynthesis of commodity chemicals. As the field matures, synthetic biology is advancing biological frontiers by expanding biomanufacturing capabilities, developing nextgenera tion therapeutic approaches, and providing new insights into natural biological systems. Here, we review the theoretical foundations, diverse tool kits, and engineered systems that have emerged from synthetic biology and discuss current as well as potential future applications, which include indepth studies of basic biology (such as understanding endogenous signaling pathways and feedback circuits) and new frontiers in health and medi cine (such as identification of diseased cells and targeted therapeutics).",

            "text": "T he ability to produce recombinant proteins has revolutionized biochemistry, enabling new experimental, therapeutic, industrial and commercial applications. For example, to date about 90% of industrial enzymes used for paper, leather, detergents, textiles, food, biofuels and animal feed are recombinant proteins 1 . Similarly, recombinant protein therapeutics have increased dramatically, both in number and in frequency 2 . Since 2011, more than 60 recombinant protein drugs have been approved by the FDA, including therapies for various cancers, autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, infectious diseases and genetic disorders [3][4][5] . However, generating proteins for such applications is a highly complex process, due to their high molecular weight, three-dimensional structures, heterogeneity, and dependence on production in living cells 6 . \n\nA critical step in the development of recombinant proteins is characterization, especially when codon optimization and protein-engineering approaches are employed. Characterizing the generated protein variants is essential for assessing their quality, and providing input for iterative redesign and optimization 7,8 . Such characterization is especially relevant when selecting the ideal host system for protein expression, optimizing product yield, or employing high-throughput investigations of lead candidates. A preliminary characterization step reduces the quantity and expense of resources wasted on inadequate protein products. It also provides a means to ensure batch-to-batch consistency. However, the characterization step is usually carried out with purified proteins, with significant costs of time and labor invested in product purification. Therefore, quality assessment of overproduced proteins with no prior purification offers a great advantage. \n\nRecently, we described a direct native mass spectrometry approach for rapid characterization of overexpressed proteins directly from crude bacterial cell lysates, overcoming the need for protein purification 9 . In spite of this progress and the fact that prokaryotic systems are often the first-choice host for initial screening of recombinant protein expression, many proteins fail to express and fold properly in this platform 10 . Alternatively, eukaryotic secretion systems provide higher capacity for proper protein folding, assembly and post-translational modifications, in comparison to bacterial hosts 10,11 .",

The ease of transformation with exogenous DNA in conjunction with extremely efficient homologous recombination capabilities make S. cerevisiae a primary choice for the recombinant production of pharmaceutical drugs and other high value chemicals. Over the years, a number of techniques have been developed for the genetic engineering of S. cerevisiae, which exploit homologous recombination and are used for genome editing and pathway reassembly. Examples include transformation-associated recombination cloning [14][15][16][17][18], long terminal repeatguided cloning [19,20] and CRISPR/Cas9 [14,[21][22][23]. This arsenal has been expanded by many plug-and-play tools, which facilitate the assembly and expression of large DNA fragments [18,20,22,[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. Other scientific breakthroughs include the development of bidirectional expression plasmids [33,34] and synthetic minimal expression systems for S. cerevisiae [35][36][37], which make pathway refactoring in this model organism feasible. \n\nThe use of yeast as a heterologous host was pioneered in the 1980s when strains were constructed for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical proteins, like interferon-\u03b1 [38,39] and insulin [39,40]. At this time, the exploration and comprehension of yeast's fundamental secretory expression pathways paved the way to a successful maturation and secretion of recombinant proteins. Of particular relevance in this context is the leader sequence of the mating type peptide pheromone \u03b1-factor in S. cerevisiae, which was found to convey secretory competence to a multitude of heterologously expressed fusion proteins, including interferon-\u03b1 and insulin [38,40,41].",

A good example is the potential prediction of translation initiation sites, which is useful for localizing proteincoding gene sites during computer-assisted annotation of bacterial and archaeal genomes [102], and prediction of putative genomic sequences that correspond to functional RNA motifs [103], or prediction of gene expression levels with new combinations of genetic elements [75]. \n\nEven experimental verification of the translation efficiency determined by any binding site in a model system cannot guarantee that an identical efficiency will be achieved if the coding region sequence is replaced. Such is the case due to secondary structure formation when the coding region and the 5' UTR are complementary. A study using specially designed bicistronic constructs was conducted in order to increase the predictability of the expression level of any gene expressed in a heterologous system. In that study, a conventional short open reading frame was located upstream of the reporter coding region whose expression efficiency was measured by flow cyto metry. The reading frames overlapped within the randomized translation re-initiation site. Therefore, it was found that re-initiation eliminates the dependence of the translation efficiency on the coding region of the second gene. Both gfp and rfp were used as the second gene in this synthetic operon. The resulting expression levels of these different genes correlated well with each other [75]. \n\nHence, experimental determination of the expression efficiency by flow cytometry or Flow-seq can be directly and reliably employed for generating expression constructs in synthetic biology.",

            "text": "Examples of this are reporter gene systems to indicate water and soil contaminants [5] or gene expression pattern in organisms [6], as well as conditional gene expression systems for mammalian cells controlled by antibiotics such as tetracycline [7]. Who would deny that they were generated based on the rational combination of \"biological parts\" with known function (i.e. regulatory DNA-elements and DNA sequences encoding proteins/protein domains) or even by constructing new \"parts\" (if we think of the hybrid transcriptional regulators made of viral and bacterial protein domains that confer tetracycline-control to mammalian cells [7]) -and that they have generated new functions? A similar overlap and coupling to synthetic biology has been recently proposed by Nielsen and Kiesling [8] for metabolic engineering (the metabolic analysis and genetic engineering of cells for improving an designing metabolic pathways). Between traditional approaches, that only increase the pathway flux towards a desired product by directed genetic modifications in a naturally producing strain, and synthetic biology's envisioned generation of complete synthetic cells designed to produce the desired product, there would be approaches that use concepts of both traditional metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. These would involve using cells that normally do not produce a product of interest, but which are able to do so after being equipped with a \"synthetic\" pathway -though initially often in small amounts only. In a second step, the flux through the pathway is then increased by traditional metabolic engineering [8]. \n\nSynthetic genomics has been defined as the engineering and manipulation of an organism's genetic material on the scale of the whole genome, based on technologies to design and chemically synthesize pieces of DNA and to assemble them to long, chromosome-sized fragments [9,10]. These can serve as entire genomes of viruses or bacteria [11,12]. Compared with traditional genetic engineering, where typically only very few nucleotides or genes in an organism are altered (mostly based on recombinant DNA technology), synthetic genomics thus allows to simultaneously change a large number of nucleotides or gene loci all over the genome by gene synthesis.",

Besides, microalgae have the unique advantages of being photoautotrophic and harboring both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, becoming a popular host for recombinant proteins. Currently, numerous advanced molecular tools related to microalgal transgenesis have been explored and established, especially for the model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii hereafter). The development of genetic tools and the emergence of new strategies further increase the feasibility of developing C. reinhardtii chloroplasts as green factories, and the strong genetic operability of C. reinhardtii endows it with enormous potential as a synthetic biology platform. At present, C. reinhardtii chloroplasts could successfully produce plenty of recombinant proteins, including antigens, antibodies, antimicrobial peptides, protein hormones and enzymes. However, additional techniques and toolkits for chloroplasts need to be developed to achieve efficient and markerless editing of plastid genomes. Mining novel genetic elements and selectable markers will be more intensively studied in the future, and more factors affecting protein expression are urged to be explored. This review focuses on the latest technological progress of selectable markers for Chlamydomonas chloroplast genetic engineering and the factors that affect the efficiency of chloroplast protein expression. Furthermore, urgent challenges and prospects for future development are pointed out.",

            "text": "Living organisms synthesize a large collection of complex products relying on a vast array of intertwined processes [1]. Synthetic biology seeks to take advantage of these processes by modifying and rewiring existing connections, and via introducing novel components. This interdisciplinary field thus holds the promise of controlling cellular behavior by combining expertise from a diverse set of domains, including experimental techniques from the life sciences and quantitative tools from engineering disciplines [2][3][4]. As a result of this integrative approach, multiple industries are expected to be transformed and revolutionized, including regenerative medicine, biosensing and bioremediation, as well as sustainable manufacturing and energy production [5][6][7][8]. \n\nWhile synthetic biology bears many similarities to traditional engineering disciplines, designing synthetic gene circuits is often time consuming due to their context-dependent behavior [9][10][11][12][13][14], frequently leading to unexpected and perplexing phenomena [15][16][17]. Thus, the construction of even simple systems typically relies on massive DNA libraries that needs to be iteratively refined, involving high-throughput screening and testing in a lengthy and expensive process [18][19][20]. Although this library-based screening approach can prove successful for modules of modest complexity, the method rapidly becomes infeasible with increasing circuit size. Context-dependence thus poses a critical limitation in synthetic biology by undermining the modular and rational design of large-scale systems. \n\nUnlike the above approach based on combinatorial DNA libraries, quantitative tools and computational techniques facilitate the rational forward-engineering of complex genetic circuits. This is achieved by leveraging mathematical models explicitly accounting for various sources of context-dependence, such as metabolic burden due to the limited availability of shared resources, both internal and external to organisms. As a result, synthesizing heterologous proteins can lead to growth rate reduction, and the expression of two unrelated proteins may become coupled [10,11,13,[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30].",

            "text": "Synthetic biology combines genetic engineering, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, electrical engineering and evolutionary biology. Synthetic biology applies these disciplines to build biological systems for research, engineering, regenerative medicine, design and industrial applications. Synthetic biology is defined as \"an emerging discipline that uses engineering principles to design and assemble biological components\" (Wellhausen & Oye, 2007), or biological modules, biological systems, and biological machines for useful purposes\". (Nakano, 2013;Hayden, 2014;Robertson, et al., 2015). The goal of synthetic biology is to extend or modify the behavior of organisms to perform new tasks. However, SB is still a developing discipline that undergo extensive investigations about its drawbacks, for example; the inability to fully predict the functions of even simple devices in engineered cells and construct systems that perform multifaceted tasks with precision and reliability, due to several sources of uncertainty, some of which show the incompleteness of the available information about inherent cellular characteristics; such as the effects of gene expression noise, mutation, cell death, undefined and changing extracellular environments, and interactions with cellular context.The process of genetic engineering offers a broader definition of SB, associated with the practices of copying DNA sequences from the genome of an organism and, through recombinant DNA, importing the sequence from one organism to another, so that the host organism exhibits some characteristic of the donor (Robertson, et al., 2015). Recently it became possible to map entire genomes for individual organisms, which make it possible to make associations between specific DNA expression and the characteristics and behaviors of individual organisms. While DNA is described as the blueprint of life, the relationship between DNA sequences, the expression of proteins and the characteristics of biological systems are significantly more complex than this analogy suggests. While there are instances of isolated gene sequences resulting in clearly defined characteristics in an organism, much of what is understood in terms of the morphology and behavior of biological systems is derived from groups of different genes being expressed through the more complex proteome which is the entire population of proteins produced by a cell or organism, at particular growth stages or in particular environments. (Robertson, et al., 2015). A highly prominent approach to SB is to abstract biological systems through design of more traditional forms of engineering.",

            "text": "In the field of synthetic genomics, the de novo design and synthesis capabilities of DNA sequences have evolved from a single gene to the entire microbial genome. Viruses, prokaryotic genomes and eukaryotic chromosomes have been successfully synthesized in the past research studies [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]. At the same time, the existing enabling technology allows introduction of complex exogenous metabolic pathways into specific microbial hosts with particular modifications to achieve specific goals. In recent years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology, microbial remediation has been drawing increased attention and shown the great potential in degrading pollutants compared to traditional physical and chemical methods. In the last decade, by the means of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" engineering approaches, synthetic biology has been proven to be a very powerful tool in utilization and modification of existing genetic materials to redesign organisms with desired abilities. Taking \"Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)\" biological engineering cycle, the standardized and universal biological component modules could be designed, constructed, integrated, tested and optimized in simple chassis cells to achieve efficient operation of a quantitative and controllable platform-based new living system [29]. The reconstruction of synthetic pathways in dedicated chassis cells for natural product production (e.g. artemisinin, avermectin, resveratrol, or penicillin) has been successfully conducted in this strategy [30]. These results have not only achieved great academic and commercial success, so that more and more researchers are focusing on the synthesis of medicines and raw materials (see Table 1). However, synthetic biology is not yet widely applied in engineering the catabolism pathways in microbes so far. Therefore, the field of synthetic biology is increasingly expanding from a focus on natural products to pollutants degradation by engineering microbes, and artificially synthesized catabolic pathways provide a new approach for environmental bioremediation [33].",

            "text": "Recent developments in artificial gene synthesis have enabled synthetic genes construction. De novo gene synthesis is a valuable synthetic biological tool for biotechnological studies which typically aim to improve tolerance to toxic molecules, retrofit existing biosynthetic pathways, design novel biosynthetic pathways and/or enhance heterologous protein production [32,33]. In the field of recombinant protein production, natural genes found in wild-type organisms are usually transformed into heterologous hosts for recombinant expression. This approach typically results in poorly expressed recombinant proteins since the wild-type foreign genes have not evolved for optimum expression in the host. Thus, it is highly desirable to harness the flexibility of synthetic biology to create customized artificial gene designs, optimal for heterologous protein expression. The degeneracy of the genetic code leads to a situation whereby most of the amino acids can be encoded by two to six synonymous codons. The synonymous codons are not equally utilized to encode the amino acids, thus resulting in phenomenon of codon usage bias. Importantly, codon usage bias has been shown to correlate with gene expression level, and it has been proposed as an important design parameter for enhancing recombinant protein production in heterologous host expression [34][35][36]. Based on this information, the popular web-based software, known as the Java Codon Adaptation Tool (JCat), allowed us to customize the T. parva p67 ORF for its expression in mammalian cells. Although we did not compare the adapted p67 ORF with the un-adapted one in terms of expression efficiency, the adapted p67 was expressed by mammalian cells both as membrane-linked and secreted form. Of note, the p67 ORF codon usage adaptation increased its GC content from 43 to 68%, which likely also influenced expression efficiency. Previous studies have shown that GC-rich genes in mammalian cells can be expressed 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterpart due to increased steady-state mRNA levels [37].",

An inducible promoter is used to turn-on recombinant protein production. When the cell is stressed, a strong repressor that is under the control of a stress reporter will be expressed, which will decrease or shut down the protein production. in our proof-of-principle experiments, we placed the recombinant protein (GFP) under a t7 promoter that would be repressed by Laci. the stress-induced promoter for heat shock proteins ibpA and ibpB was used to drive the tetr expression, which in turn adaptively regulated the production of GPF by binding to its promoter.

In this context, a Type IIS modular cloning assembly method allowing the design of complex genetic circuits containing multiple transcription units guided by a user-friendly and intuitive computational pipeline has been developed and validated for a close relative of R. eutropha, Cupriavidus metallidurans (Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2023). It is possible, perhaps even likely, that such a combinatorial assembly system could be used in R. eutropha strains, as well. \n\nRegarding programmable gene repression, to date, only one recent study developed a robust strategy for repressing gene expression in R. eutropha. Wang and coworkers designed a CRISPR interference system (CRISPRi) using an engineered dCas9 lacking DNA cleavage capability but retaining DNA binding capacity under the guidance of a single guide RNA, posing a steric hindrance effect that effectively inhibits transcription (Wang et al. 2024a). By this, the authors were able to tailor the expression level of a fluorescence protein reporter as well as the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Furthermore, the same study applied CRISPRi to achieve increased mutation rates during adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) by disturbing the expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene mutS.",

While these developments all represent important milestones towards the goal of wide-scale protein engineering, full implementation demands a deeper understanding of the constraints imposed by recoding activities in the context of a living cell. Current work in this area is focusing on the \"context dependence\" of recoding and suppression experiments, as it is manifested by DNA sequence context, mRNA secondary structure context, and even the structural context of the resulting protein (Lital Alfonta, Ben-Gurion University; John Fisk, Colorado State University). In spite of these challenges, the revolution in synthetic biology catalyzed by the intelligent engineering of tRNA synthetases is beginning to realize some long sought-after goals. For example, it will soon be possible to produce human kinases in bacterial systems that are multiply phosphorylated-rather than with phosphomimetic residues-and other proteins that are activated by the presence of multiple acetylations (Patrick O'Donogue, U. Western Ontario).",

            "text": "Directed evolution has revolutionized synthetic biology. Inspired by natural selection, this engineering approach encompasses cycles of genetic diversification and enrichment of rare desired variants, allowing for accelerated protein evolution even with limited a priori knowledge about the structurefunction relationships (Romero and Arnold, 2009;Packer and Liu, 2015;Wang et al., 2021). Directed evolution enabled engineering of a plethora of proteins, genetic pathways, and even genomes to generate variants with improved or tailor-made properties (Chatterjee and Yuan, 2006;Johannes and Zhao, 2006;Hida et al., 2007;Turner, 2009;Xiong et al., 2012;Bornscheuer et al., 2019;Engqvist and Rabe, 2019;Zhou et al., 2021). Incorporation of directed evolution principles to the construction framework of a synthetic cell has recently been proposed (Abil and Danelon, 2020).\n\nCompartmentalized gene expression in liposomes (Yu et al., 2001;Nomura et al., 2003;Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004) has gained considerable momentum in the last few years, with methodological advances that have improved the yield of functional vesicles (Fujii et al., 2014;Blanken et al., 2019), enabling the reconstitution of complex biological functions, such as DNA replication (van Nies et al., 2018), phospholipid synthesis (Blanken et al., 2020), membrane deformation processes (Godino et al., 2019(Godino et al., , 2020Kattan et al., 2021) and light-triggered ATP synthesis (Berhanu et al., 2019). Moving forward to optimizing and integrating cellular modules may require a system's level evolutionary approach (Abil and Danelon, 2020).\n\nOver the past decades, numerous in vivo and cell-free methodologies for gene expression of the targeted phenotypes have been developed. In vivo methodologies have been the most common, since a suitable host organism could provide low-cost gene expression with a reliable yield (Pourmir and Johannes, 2012). However, cell-free systems have emerged as an alternative and attractive platform due to the higher degree of controllability and freedom from the constrains related to cell survival (Shimi",

            "text": "The elucidation of plant specialized metabolites biosynthesis has enabled notable advances in metabolic engineering approaches, as previously reported, but has also promoted the emergence of synthetic biology strategies. The technology relies on the reconstruction and optimization of a plant metabolic pathway in a microbial host organism. In the last ten years, synthetic biology has become one of the most valuable alternatives to native plants for the high yield production of complex and valuable compounds in a heterologous system. Microbial engineering offers several advantages, namely the fast growth of the host microorganism, which has the capability to satisfy the commercial demand; the use of fermenters, which allows scalability and the controlled production of a given molecules; along with yield in high amount and purity, without the production of side compounds. All these aspects allow us to reduce time consuming and costly processes for the production and extraction of a natural product from the native plant. Specimens within the bacteria and fungi kingdom, notably Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, are the most used hosts. Once one has begun planning a synthetic metabolic strategy, an immediate decision to take is whether yeast or bacteria is the best suited system to produce a specific plant-derived metabolite. These microbial representatives have several favourable features and disadvantages. In detail, E coli is easy to grow and to genetically manipulate and allows the large-scale production of recombinant proteins in a short amount of time. This requires scalable and low-cost culture conditions, but it presents several disadvantages among which there is the difficulty of expressing some eukaryotic proteins, the accumulation of proteins as inclusion bodies, the degradation of expressed proteins because of host protease contamination, and also endotoxin accumulation. S. cerevisiae is an economic eukaryotic expression system which combines the advantages of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. This system is mostly used to express either secretory or intracellular proteins, because it grants correct protein folding. This yeast system allows high protein yield, lesser expression time, post translational modifications and requires simple media. This system can be optimized for high level protein expression using fermenters.",

            "text": "In this section, we will discuss synthetic biology tools that could aid the metabolic engineering of cyclodipeptide production and enhance their chemical diversification. Synthetic biology, protein engineering, and metabolic engineering rely on one another to thrive and accomplish their aims [176][177][178][179] . The goal of synthetic biology is to create libraries of genetic components (promoters, coding sequences, terminators, transcription factors and their binding sequences, and more), to assemble devices, genetic circuits, and even (re-)designed organisms, and to retrieve quantitative data to develop models that can predict the behavior of biological systems [180] . Metabolic engineering aims to maximize existing and synthetic cellular processes to synthesize the desired product from an ideally inexpensive and simple substrate [177] . The goal of protein engineering within the context of metabolic engineering mostly focuses on enzymes and biosensors [ 181 , 182 ]. It reaches from changing the substrate specificity of an enzyme or receptor, enhancing catalytic rates, and dynamic ranges, eliminating inhibition; changing physicochemical properties (e.g. solubility, stability), but also designing entire new enzymes or sensors with new-to-nature functions. \n\nThe overall workflow in synthetic biology and metabolic-and protein engineering relies on the so-called design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle: 1) A new biological part or system with the desired output is first designed in silico based on previous knowledge and/or mathematical and computational modeling. Often many possible designs are created that are channeled into the DBTL cycle to enhance the chance that one of the designs functions as predicted. 2) The designs are then built \"in DNA \" by assembling required genes, circuits, and pathways on plasmids or by engineering organisms on the genomic DNA level. 3 and 4) The designs are then tested with appropriate assays and the results and best designs are fed back into the DBTL cycle for further improvement. The goal of synthetic biology has been to provide tools and resources to run the cycle as efficiently as possible and to reduce the rounds required to achieve an engineering goal.",

            "text": "Vibrio natriegens (V. natriegens), is a fast-growing gram-negative bacterium identified in the 1960s of the 20th century with a remarkable division time of less than 10 min (Eagon, 1962). Despite the fact that Escherichia coli (E. coli) is considered the most convenient organism for lab work, it has a division time that is roughly double that of V. natriegens (Clark and Maal\u00f8e, 1967). Considering the need to optimize the efficiency of molecular and synthetic biology studies in the lab, V. natriegens presents an unprecedented opportunity to speed-up lab work and emerges as a novel synthetic biology and biotechnological chassis. Apart from its rapid growth, V. natriegens can also reach higher cell densities than E. coli, it can tolerate a broad range of pH conditions, possess natural competence for environmental DNA receival, utilize a wide range of substrate and grow on various carbon sources, has a higher substrate uptake, can serve as a safer expression host for pathogen related proteins and express proteins in high yields. Recently, multiple studies have emerged, demonstrating the adaptation of methodologies used in E. coli, for their utilization in V. natriegens (Hoff et al., 2020;Peng et al., 2020). As such, protein expression (Weinstock et al., 2016;Schleicher et al., 2018), molecular biology (Weinstock et al., 2016;Dalia et al., 2017;Tschirhart et al., 2019), and cell-free protein expression platforms (Des Soye et al., 2018;Failmezger et al., 2018;Wiegand et al., 2018) were successfully developed in V. natriegens. \n\nThe incorporation of unnatural amino acids (Uaas) into proteins is part of the genetic code expansion experimental efforts and is considered a powerful tool in protein engineering (Xiao and Schultz, 2016).",

            "text": "This system is valuable in applications in which gene expression must be sustained in the turn-off state for long periods, and gene induction (turn-on) can be manipulated under the control of the inducer [18]. \n\nThere are many factors concerning types of host cell lines, cell culture medias, culture methods, transfection procedures, selection techniques, expression vectors, and the optimization of genes of interest for high-yield production of recombinant proteins [19]. Enhancing the transcriptional level using different approaches are considered such as the integration of a strong promoter sequence, an activator, an enhancer, and the manipulation of target gene by genetic engineering [20,21]. However, the expression of a protein does not always relate to its mRNA levels [22], and a rate-limiting step can be the secretory machinery. The proper signal peptide is a key factor involved in the precise translocation and secretion of proteins [23]. Regarding recombinant NGAL production, the human serum albumin (HSA) signal peptide has been reported as the most efficient machinery among others such as the native signal peptide of NGAL, the signal peptides of human interleukin-2 (IL2), gaussia luciferase (Gluc), and hidden Markov model-generated signal sequence (HMM38) [24]. \n\nIn this respect, we applied the Tet-On inducible system and the appropriate signal peptide for the production of soluble NGAL protein in 293T cells. This system is able to both regulate the protein expression and enhance protein secretion for increasing the production yield. This feature of the vector design could be a model to further produce recombinant NGAL at a large scale.",

            "text": "Genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology are the current molecular techniques used to promote efficient  enzyme production [18,[28][29][30]. Recombinant DNA technology for amylase production involves the selection of an efficient amylase gene, gene insertion into an appropriate vector system, transformation in an efficient bacterial system to produce a high amount of recombinant protein (in the presence of an expression-vector promoter-inducing agent), and purification of the protein for downstream applications (Figure 5). In this technology, high-copy numbers of the gene promote higher yields of amylase [30]. On the other hand, screening mutant libraries for selection of the best mutant variants for recombinant amylase production has been more successful (Figure 6). Zhang et al. [31] deleted amyR (encoding a transcription factor) from A. niger CICC2462, which led to the production of enzyme/protein specifically with lower background protein secretion. Wang et al. [32] generated a new strategy to express the -amylase from Pyrococcus furiosus in B. amyloliquefaciens. This extracellular thermostable enzyme is produced in low amount in P. furiosus, but its expression in B. amyloliquefaciens was significantly increased and had good stability at higher temperature (optimum 100 \u2218 C) and lower pH (optimum pH 5). By mimicking the P. furiosus system, they obtained a novel amylase with yields \u223c3000and 14-fold higher amylase units/milliliter than that produced in B. subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively.",

These techniques include computational modelling, omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), and synthetic biology tools. Identifying metabolic pathways, uncovering metabolic bottlenecks, and predicting genetic targets for metabolic engineering are all made possible by integrating multi-omics data. Developing new biosurfactant synthesis routes, higher catalytic efficiency through enzyme engineering, and increased biosurfactant output through chassis optimization are all made possible by synthetic biology (Malla et al., 2022). \n\nResearchers have fully realised the potential of biosurfactants as adaptable and sustainable biomolecules for various industrial, environmental, and medicinal applications by utilising advancements in genetic manipulation and systems biology (Lamilla et al., 2021). By engineering microorganisms that produce biosurfactants and developing innovative biosynthetic pathways, scientists have manipulated the structures of biosurfactants to improve their properties and maximize their yield (Jimoh et al., 2021). Biosynthetic enzymes responsible for biosurfactant production have been engineered using directed evolution and rational protein design approaches. This has allowed for the development of variations with changed substrate specificity, catalytic activity, and product specificity. For instance, modification of the glycosyltransferases' substrate specificity during glycolipid biosynthesis has produced biosurfactants with customized sugar moieties, which can change the physicochemical characteristics and biological activities of the resulting compounds (Fujinami et al., 2021). Moreover, combinatorial biosynthesis techniques like enzyme fusion and domain shuffling have been applied to produce hybrid biosurfactants with synergistic qualities originating from many biosynthetic pathways. For example, a bidirectional synthetic approach makes it simple to synthesise aureosurfactin, which allows both enantiomers to have surface tension activity comparable to that of recognised biosurfactants (Mittendorf et al., 2023).",

However, the key principle of building to understand is undoubtedly a powerful motivation, and cellfree systems represent perhaps one of the best examples where this is currently being put into practice. While cell-free systems have historically been used to deconstruct biology, allowing its core processes to be elucidated, recent advances have led to its increasing application to construct biological systems.\n\nToday, basic cell-free lysate systems are less of a black-box, and better characterization of their properties and preparation methods has made them an increasingly engineerable, and maybe more importantly, accessible tool. Recombinant systems have been the focus of increasing investigation as users demand more modularity and cost-effectiveness. Technological innovation in automation, microfluidics, and materials science have enabled increased throughput, dynamic control of steady-state reactions, and sophisticated compartmentalization strategies, while at the same time becoming accessible to more labs around the world.\n\nHowever, there are also clear challenges ahead. Compartmentalizing cell-free reactions has exposed important physical effects, such as crowding and differential partitioning, which, while complex, may one day be harnessed to control the microscale spatial organization of gene expression. This level of fine control, exhibited by all cells, currently eludes us. Cell-free gene expression studies have unveiled a number of effects, such as physical properties of promoters, supercoiling and compositional context dependencies, and the ever-present resource burden of heterologous gene circuits. Replication studies have pointed out to the difficulty of achieving efficient DNA replication and protein synthesis in a cell-free reaction. And while increasingly complex communication systems have been implemented, the field is still in a nascent stage.\n\nA common theme in constructing complex systems is emergence: as the system grows in size, effects appear which cannot be predicted by assessing the parts independently. In synthetic biology, these confounding effects currently stymie many efforts. But it is exactly because cell-free studies allow us to work at the interface between simple and complex systems that they are well-poised to address these issues. Ultimately, a thorough understanding of these effects will allow us to turn what are currently viewed as",

Similar to transcription, translation encompasses many different classes of molecules that can serve as good targets for optimization and rewiring cells. However, less is known about the most essential molecules in this process. \n\nOne of the most successful examples of synthetically engineering translation machinery involves the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins [73]. In this work, mutant aminoacyl tRNA synthetases incorporate amino acids with diverse R-group chemistries into proteins. This approach holds a great deal of promise for the synthetic biologist as a means of creating wholly new biological functions and chemistries [29,[74][75][76]. This direction towards designer proteins is akin to nontemplate based DNA synthesis. However, as with de novo DNA synthesis, it is not always clear which amino acid(s) should be changed to an unnatural analog to confer a desired protein function of interest. In this regard, more work is required to develop a computational linkage between sequence and function. Nevertheless, this approach gives significant leverage to synthetic biologists to create custom proteins with desired functions. \n\nAnother example of engineering translation is gene codon optimization [33]. Codon optimization is a method to bias the redundant codons for each amino acid toward the codons most commonly found in the host organism. This approach is greatly expedited by sequencing and synthesis technologies that can produce the required alternately coded genes. Codon optimization has been shown to be successful in many cases [77][78][79][80][81][82] and has led to improved translation rates, protein yields, and enzymatic activities. When combined with pathway engineering, codon-optimized pathways are typically more efficient than their unengineered counterpart. This approach is especially important when attempting to produce natural products found in systems distantly related to the host organisms (such as importing plant genes into E. coli [83]). Finally, computational techniques are continually being developed to perform the task of codon optimization and assembly design which will improve our ability to control this process step [84].",

            "text": "BackgroundTranscriptional control of gene expression is a widely utilized regulatory mechanism in synthetic biology, biotechnology and recombinant protein production. It is achieved by utilization of naturally occurring promoters responding to nutrients or chemicals. Despite their regulatory properties, these promoters often possess features which diminish their utility for biotechnology. High basal expression level and low induction ratio can be removed using genetic engineering techniques, although this process is often laborious and time-consuming.ResultsIn order to facilitate optimization process for inducible promoters, we developed a simple method based on a conditional toxin expression which we abbreviate as toxin expression control strategy (TECS). In the presence of sucrose, SacB enzyme from Bacillus subtilis synthesizes levans which cause Eschericha coli cell lysis. However, in the absence of sucrose the enzyme does not affect the growth of the host. We utilized this feature to develop a two-step protocol allowing for efficient selection of inducible promoter variants. Using TECS we were able to modify the well-described pBAD promoter to decrease its leakage while maintaining high activity upon induction. Furthermore, we used the method to test transcriptional interference of lambda phage-derived sequence and optimize it for higher induction levels through random mutagenesis.ConclusionsWe show that TECS is an efficient tool for optimization and development of inducible promoter systems in E. coli. Our strategy is very effective in the selection of promoter variants with improved properties. Its simplicity and short hands-on time make it an attractive method to optimize existing promoters and to construct novel, engineered genetic elements which improve properties of an inducible promoter system.",

Added to this, the cost of escalation and characteristics of post-translational modifications [14,149,150] are also aspects to consider. \n\nIn the case of D. salina, research showed this expression system as a practical solution for the production of different types of recombinant proteins and promises to be a production method based on the advantages of culture, transformation method, immunomodulatory compounds, glycosylation patterns, and natural encapsulation. The status of the investigation on the genetic manipulation of D. salina is in the early stages; however, the data suggest it can be a practical, tangible option for the vaccine industry. The mucosal administration of antigens (oral, ocular, or intranasal) presents requirements for a correct application, which not all recombinant protein expression systems can meet [14]. Hence, microalgae have advantages over other systems. \n\nIn addition to previously described advantages, microalgae are organisms capable of photosynthesizing by capturing environmental inorganic carbon (CO 2 ) [151]. As is known, microalgae are efficiently photosynthetic microorganisms [152]. Therefore, it is not only necessary to consider the advantages of a system such as microalgae without considering other social and environmental factors for developing a protein expression platform at an industrial level. \n\nMore research is needed on several details of the heterologous protein expression microalgae model, including regulatory sequences, codon-optimization [51,153], and efficient expression vectors [94,154,155]. Nevertheless, data available allows for considering D. salina as a protein expression system with potential for antigen production and its mucosal administration.",

            "text": "The workflow starts with in vitro construction and in vivo amplifying of combinatorially assembled DNA fragments to generate gene modules. Terminal homology between adjacent assembly fragments and the plasmids allows generating diverse construct in single cloning reaction. In each module, the gene expression is controlled by library of regulators 39 . To decrease the turnaround time in bioengineering projects, CRISPR/Cas-based editing strategies are implemented for multi-locus integration of multiple groups of modules into loci, whereby each group is integrated into a single locus of different microbial cells 39 . Sequential rounds of cloning enable the construction of entire pathway in a plasmid. The established plasmid can be either transformed into the host (e.g. VEGAS method 43 ) or be used for single-or multi-locus integration into the microbial host genomes to generate combinatorial library (e.g. COMPASS 39 ). Therefore, combinatorial optimization projects require tools and methods to assemble parts in genetic circuits, to change DNA sequences, and to integrate DNA pieces into the genome of an organism 31 . Here, we discuss two important synthetic biology tools: \"advanced orthogonal regulators\" and \"advanced genome-editing tools\", as well as the recently established combinatorial optimization strategies. \n\nAdvanced orthogonal regulators. Constitutive promoters are typically used to express heterologous genes in microbial cell factories, but this is often metabolically burdensome as the formation of the product competes with cell growth and proliferation 8 . Hence, auto-inducible (or self-induction) protein expression systems were established to pair growth and induction of recombinant proteins at desired time 44 . The system utilizes a cell density-based control module that allows tight regulation of the transcription of the recombinant gene; at low cell density, its expression is negligible while at high cell density expression is high. Such cell density-based control systems usually employ the quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms from Vibrio fischeri implemented in E. coli. However, these systems require the use of an extra plasmid for the production of proteins under control of the regulatory elements, which might be undesirable, particularly when multiple genes must be expressed.",

In such cases, the use of SPP is advantageous as the overproduction will not affect the growth of the host cells. Many bacteria have been used to demonstrate the utility of celldensity-dependent expression systems for heterologous protein production. Metabolic engineering of bacteria for enhanced production of industrially important chemicals has been carried out since a long time. The fic promoter of E. coli was used to express phlD gene at a higher titer in stationary phase, without the addition of any inducer, for the production of phloroglucinol, which has utility in pharmaceutical industry and plant tissue culture. After 20 h of cultivation in a flask with shaking, 9% of glucose supplied had converted to phloroglucinol with a productivity of 0.014g/l h (Cao and Xian, 2011). B. subtilis has been engineered for overproduction of aminopeptidase using a mutated PsrfA system and has resulted in 87.89 U/ml of enzyme activity (Guan et al., 2015). Using B. subtilis, a cry-promoter-based system was developed wherein cellulose and alkaline protease were produced with a higher yield as compared to the wild-type cry3A promoter (Lee et al., 2010). \n\nIt is a well-known fact that the non-growing phase of lactic acid bacteria accounts for a major proportion of flavor production in lactic acid bacteria (van de Bunt et al., 2014). \n\nTherefore, engineering bacterial cells in such a way that they are expressed at high levels, during the ripening process, by using SPPs would enhance their applicability in food industry. \n\nIn the bioremediation industry, microorganisms have routinely been employed for removing pollutants. Due to low nutrient availability in polluted sites, genetic engineering of cells resulting in higher enzymatic activities at lower growth rates have been shown to be highly efficient for bioremediation process.",

            "text": "The pharmaceutical industry has long depended on synthetic chemistry approaches to develop novel therapeutics. These approaches, which have led to numerous breakthroughs in drug development, have typically relied on screening compound libraries populated by a range of molecules derived from a set of known and robust chemistry reactions in order to achieve improved efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties 1 . However, they often fall short when addressing complex diseases or diseases with genetic roots. Additionally, the cost and extended development timelines associated with these approaches have the potential to limit their application to emergent diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Synthetic biology, a field that has already had a significant impact on the agricultural, environmental, and renewable biofuel industries 2 , has emerged as an attractive alternative drug development approach. \n\nSynthetic biology is a scientific field that involves the rewiring of organisms or biomolecular parts for new and desired abilities. This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies. Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s 3 . These scientific breakthroughs allowed scientists to manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways and opened the door for a wave of innovation in genetic engineering, such as the invention of polymerase chain reaction in 1983 4 , which allowed researchers to amplify DNA sequences for use in genetic manipulation. Not long after, in the 1990s genomics emerged as a field that involved sequencing entire genomes and provided researchers with complete maps of genomes 5 , punctuated by the completion of the human genome project in 2003 5,6 . These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites) 7 .",

            "text": "( 5) Transgenic technology has allowed for recombinant protein production in living animals such as rabbits, goats, pigs, and cows. Though the transformation of recombinant proteins in mammary glands has been showing a great promise, the production of recombinant protein in blood requires the use of high cost and complicated procedures. Moreover, the process of producing transgenic animals is labor, time, and cost intensive [1,143]. (6) As for foreign proteins expressed in plants, it may be transiently transformed in nuclear, stably transformed in nuclear and chloroplast or plastid. More details are described as follows: (a) When recombinant proteins were generated by transient expression using RNA virus vectors or agrobacterium-mediated transient expression through Agroinfection, higher yields can generally be obtained. Recombinant proteins including antigen products have to be extracted and purified. Downstream processing of recombinant products is very expensive, amounting to more than 80% of the total expense [7,144]. (b) Product yields of recombinant proteins are usually <1% of total soluble proteins in nuclear transformation in plant. Hence, efficient protein purification from transgenic plants is a major challenge, and high impurity content in the feed streams. These drive up the costs of downstream processing [129,144,145]. However, if therapeutic proteins and vaccines are delivered orally, then edible transgenic plant offers the possibility of eliminating the need for expensive downstream protein purification and processing, especially in seed-based production [9,144,146]. (c) As described above, expression of a target gene from the chloroplast genome generally provides higher yields. The high expression of recombinant proteins within plastid-engineered systems offers a costeffective solution for using plants as a bioreactor. As with nuclear transgenics, the cost for purification of therapeutic proteins and vaccines can be eliminated if they are orally delivered or minimized by the use of novel purification strategies [1,147]. \n\nRecently, purification cost and production cost of bioreactor engineering for recombinant protein were assayed in bacterial, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and plant cells.",

            "text": "A promising new technology is based on pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins known for their affinity to bind RNA rather DNA molecules (Yagi et al., 2014). The nucleotide sequence specificity of PPR proteins for RNA binding and editing leads itself amenable to design of customizable enzymes suited to precision RNA engineering.\n\nHere, we present a conceptual scheme of integration of systems biology and synthetic biology for understanding the molecular basis of cell wall biosynthesis and its regulation ( Figure 2). Firstly, from a top-down view, the various omics data are processed and analysed by common platform, and further integrated to form mathematical models; from a bottom-up view, to test hypotheses or models, individual perturbations are designed to generate new data sets for analysis. Secondly, through the systems biology iterations, meaningful models or genetic circuits would guide the design of synthetic biology to perform high-precision engineering tasks ( Figure 2). Specifically, systems biology studies could provide biological 'parts' (e.g. genes, promoters) and framework (e.g. gene network, spatial and temporal expression, metabolic flux and balance) for synthetic biology approaches such as precision genome editing and multiple gene transfer to reduce biomass recalcitrance.\n\nIn addition to the emerging tools of genetic engineering mentioned above, methods also exist for 'rational' engineering of enzyme structure. There are two main approaches to improving or creating new protein functions, rational design of proteins and directed evolution. Put simply, rational design is the is the generation of new designer proteins based on prior knowledge, and directed evolution is the selection of new functions on the basis of screening of randomly generated variant proteins.\n\nEnzymes of cellulase or glucohydrolase family have been employed in 'rational design' strategies to improve the catalytic efficiency during biomass conversion, (Buckeridge and Gustavo, 2011). In general, site-directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis are two common strategies by which modifications of key residues of proteins of interest. Through three-dimensional structure and molecular dynamics simulation analyses of normal and mutated protein, the knowledge of biochemical importance of key residues would guide the rational design to alter protein structure (McLaughlin et al., 2012). For example, based on the structures of class II cellobiohy",

Synthetic biology accumulates the achievements of modern biological sciences, programming and computational model\u00ading as well as engineering technologies for creation of biologi\u00adcal objects with user-defined properties. Evolution of synthetic biology has been marked by a number of technological developments in each of the mentioned fields. Thus, significant reduction in cost of DNA sequencing has provided an easy access to large amounts of data on the genetic sequences of various organisms, and decreased the price of the DNA sequence synthesis, which, analogous to Moore\u2019s law, resulted in an opportunity to create a lot of potential genes without the time \u2013 consuming and labor \u2013 intensive traditional methods of molecular biology. Development of system biology has allowed forming a deeper understanding of the functions and relationship of natural biological models, as well as of the computational models describing processes at the cell and system levels. Combination of these factors has created an op\u00adportunity for conscious changes of natural biological systems.

Next, we review the types of proteins, protein complexes, and protein modifications that have been achieved using CFPS systems. Finally, we introduce recent work on genetic networks in cell-free systems and the use of cell-free systems for rapid prototyping of in vivo networks. Given the flexibility of cell-free systems, CFPS holds promise to be a powerful tool for synthetic biology as well as a protein production technology in years to come.",

In this study, we present the design of thermoresponsive quorum-sensing (ThermoQS) circuits to make Escherichia coli record transient heat stimuli. By conversion of the heat input into the accumulation of quorum-sensing molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sustained gene expressions were achieved by a minimal heat stimulus. Moreover, we also demonstrated that we reprogrammed the E. coli Lac operon to make it respond to heat stimuli with an impressive signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 15.3. Taken together, we envision that the ThermoQS systems reported in this study are expected to remarkably diminish both design and experimental expenditures for future metabolic engineering applications.",

Green biomanufacturing of recombinant collagen has become one of the focus topics.

As such, it deals with the engineering (design, construction, and optimization) of native as well as non-natural routes of product synthesis, aided in this task by the availability of synthetic DNA, the core enabling technology of synthetic biology. The two fields, however, only partially overlap in their interest in pathway engineering. While fabrication of biobricks, synthetic cells, genetic circuits, and nonlinear cell dynamics, along with pathway engineering, have occupied researchers in the field of synthetic biology, the sum total of these areas does not constitute a coherent definition of synthetic biology with a distinct intellectual foundation and well-defined areas of application. This paper reviews the origins of the two fields and advances two distinct paradigms for each of them: that of unit operations for metabolic engineering and electronic circuits for synthetic biology. In this context, metabolic engineering is about engineering cell factories for the biological manufacturing of chemical and pharmaceutical products, whereas the main focus of synthetic biology is fundamental biological research facilitated by the use of synthetic DNA and genetic circuits."

Encouraged by progress in the design of artificial gene networks, de novo DNA synthesis and protein engineering, we review the case for this emerging discipline. Key aspects of an engineering approach are purpose-orientation, deep insight into the underlying scientific principles, a hierarchy of abstraction including suitable interfaces between and within the levels of the hierarchy, standardization and the separation of design and fabrication. Synthetic biology investigates possibilities to implement these requirements into the process of engineering biological systems. This is illustrated on the DNA level by the implementation of engineering-inspired artificial operations such as toggle switching, oscillating or production of spatial patterns. On the protein level, the functionally self-contained domain structure of a number of proteins suggests possibilities for essentially Lego-like recombination which can be exploited for reprogramming DNA binding domain specificities or signaling pathways. Alternatively, computational design emerges to rationally reprogram enzyme function. Finally, the increasing facility of de novo DNA synthesis-synthetic biology's system fabrication process-supplies the possibility to implement novel designs for ever more complex systems. Some of these elements have merged to realize the first tangible synthetic biology applications in the area of manufacturing of pharmaceutical compounds."

The establishment of targeted gene-disrupted zebrafish (knockouts) is readily achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification. Recently, exogenous DNA integration into the zebrafish genome via homology-independent DNA repair was reported, but this integration contained various mutations at the junctions of genomic and integrated DNA. Thus, precise genome modification into targeted genomic loci remains to be achieved. Here, we describe efficient, precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration using a donor vector harbouring short homologous sequences (10\u201340\u2005bp) flanking the genomic target locus. We succeeded in integrating with high efficiency an exogenous mCherry or eGFP gene into targeted genes (tyrosinase and krtt1c19e) in frame. We found the precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA without backbone vector sequences when Cas9 cleavage sites were introduced at both sides of the left homology arm, the eGFP sequence and the right homology arm. Furthermore, we confirmed that this precise genome modification was heritable. This simple method enables precise targeted gene knock-in in zebrafish.",

The recently developed genome editing system called CRISPR/Cas9 offers a new tool to inactivate the integrated latent HIV-1 DNA and may serve as a new avenue toward cure.FindingsWe tested 10 sites in HIV-1 DNA that can be targeted by CRISPR/Cas9. The engineered CRISPR/Cas9 system was introduced into the JLat10.6 cells that are latently infected by HIV-1. The sequencing results showed that each target site in HIV-1 DNA was efficiently mutated by CRISPR/Cas9 with the target site in the second exon of Rev (called T10) exhibiting the highest degree of mutation. As a result, HIV-1 gene expression and virus production were significantly diminished with T10 causing a 20-fold reduction.ConclusionsThe CRISPR/Cas9 complex efficiently mutates and deactivates HIV-1 proviral DNA in latently infected Jurkat cells. Our results also revealed a highly efficient Cas9 target site within the second exon of Rev that represents a promising target to be further explored in the CRISPR/Cas9-based cure strategy.",

The CRISPR-Cas components, Cas9 gene and a designer genome targeting CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), show robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci in yeast. Using constitutive Cas9 expression and a transient gRNA cassette, we show that targeted double-strand breaks can increase homologous recombination rates of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotide donors by 5-fold and 130-fold, respectively. In addition, co-transformation of a gRNA plasmid and a donor DNA in cells constitutively expressing Cas9 resulted in near 100% donor DNA recombination frequency.

Here, we report the development of the genetically defined L\u2010threonine overproducing Escherichia coli strain by systems metabolic engineering. Feedback inhibitions of aspartokinase I and III (encoded by thrA and lysC, respectively) and transcriptional attenuation regulations (located in thrL) were removed. Pathways for Thr degradation were removed by deleting tdh and mutating ilvA. The metA and lysA genes were deleted to make more precursors available for Thr biosynthesis. Further target genes to be engineered were identified by transcriptome profiling combined with in silico flux response analysis, and their expression levels were manipulated accordingly. The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce Thr with a high yield of 0.393 g per gram of glucose, and 82.4 g/l Thr by fed\u2010batch culture. The systems metabolic engineering strategy reported here may be broadly employed for developing genetically defined organisms for the efficient production of various bioproducts.",

Eliciting pathway expression is always challenging but extremely important in natural product discovery because an individual pathway is tightly controlled through a unique regulation mechanism and hence often remains silent under the routine culturing conditions. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches that lack general applicability, we developed a simple synthetic biology approach that decouples pathway expression from complex native regulations. Briefly, the entire silent biosynthetic pathway is refactored using a plug-and-play scaffold and a set of heterologous promoters that are functional in a heterologous host under the target culturing condition. Using this strategy, we successfully awakened the silent spectinabilin pathway from Streptomyces orinoci. This strategy bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit pathway expression and represents a new platform for discovering novel natural products.",

Here we use components of the Mesoplasma florum transfer-messenger RNA system to create a synthetic degradation system that provides both independent control of steady-state protein level and inducible degradation of targeted proteins in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate application of this system in synthetic circuit development and control of core bacterial processes and antibacterial targets, and we transfer the system to Lactococcus lactis to establish its broad functionality in bacteria. We create a 238-member library of tagged essential proteins in E. coli that can serve as both a research tool to study essential gene function and an applied system for antibiotic discovery. Our synthetic protein degradation system is modular, does not require disruption of host systems and can be transferred to diverse bacteria with minimal modification.",

Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.ResultsHere, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number.ConclusionsThe standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized."

Feedback inhibitions of aspartokinase I and III (encoded by thrA and lysC, respectively) and transcriptional attenuation regulations (located in thrL) were removed. Pathways for Thr degradation were removed by deleting tdh and mutating ilvA. The metA and lysA genes were deleted to make more precursors available for Thr biosynthesis. Further target genes to be engineered were identified by transcriptome profiling combined with in silico flux response analysis, and their expression levels were manipulated accordingly. The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce Thr with a high yield of 0.393 g per gram of glucose, and 82.4 g/l Thr by fed\u2010batch culture.

Eliciting pathway expression is always challenging but extremely important in natural product discovery because an individual pathway is tightly controlled through a unique regulation mechanism and hence often remains silent under the routine culturing conditions. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches that lack general applicability, we developed a simple synthetic biology approach that decouples pathway expression from complex native regulations. Briefly, the entire silent biosynthetic pathway is refactored using a plug-and-play scaffold and a set of heterologous promoters that are functional in a heterologous host under the target culturing condition. Using this strategy, we successfully awakened the silent spectinabilin pathway from Streptomyces orinoci. This strategy bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit pathway expression and represents a new platform for discovering novel natural products.",

We create a 238-member library of tagged essential proteins in E. coli that can serve as both a research tool to study essential gene function and an applied system for antibiotic discovery.

Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.ResultsHere, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number.ConclusionsThe standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized."

The type and proportion of microorganisms found in the intestines can determine the energy balance of the host. Intestinal microorganisms perform many important functions, one of which is participation in metabolic processes, e.g., in the production of short-chain fatty acids\u2014SCFAs (also called volatile fatty acids). These acids represent the main carbon flow from the diet to the host microbiome. Maintaining intestinal balance is necessary to maintain the host\u2019s normal health and prevent many diseases. The results of many studies confirm the beneficial effect of probiotic microorganisms on the balance of the intestinal microbiome and produced metabolites, including SCFAs. The aim of this review is to summarize what is known on the effects of probiotics on the production of short-chain fatty acids by gut microbes. In addition, the mechanism of formation and properties of these metabolites is discussed and verified test results confirming the effectiveness of probiotics in human nutrition by modulating SCFAs production by intestinal microbiome is presented.",

Here, we discuss the often-forgotten challenges in manufacturing the strains and incorporating them in consumer products that provide the required dose at the end of shelf life. For manufacturing, an intricate production process is required that ensures both high yield and stability and must also be able to meet requirements such as the absence of specific allergens, which precludes some obvious culture media ingredients. Reproducibility is important to ensure constant high performance and quality. To ensure this, quality control throughout the whole production process, from raw materials to the final product, is essential, as is the documentation of this quality control. Consumer product formulation requires extensive skill and experience. Traditionally, probiotic lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria have been incorporated in fermented dairy products, with limited shelf life and refrigerated storage. Currently, probiotics may be incorporated in dietary supplements and other \u201cdry\u201d food matrices which are expected to have up to 24 months of stability at ambient temperature and humidity. With the right choice of production process, product formulation, and strains, high-quality probiotics can be successfully included in a wide variety of delivery formats to suit consumer requirements."

Recent work has focused on defining and developing standard biological parts. The technical standard that has gained the most traction in the synthetic biology community is the BioBrick standard for physical composition of genetic parts. Parts that conform to the BioBrick assembly standard are BioBrick standard biological parts. To date, over 2,000 BioBrick parts have been contributed to, and are available from, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.ResultsHere we extended the same advantages of BioBrick standard biological parts to the plasmid-based vectors that are used to provide and propagate BioBrick parts. We developed a process for engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts. We designed a new set of BioBrick parts that encode many useful vector functions. We combined the new parts to make a BioBrick base vector that facilitates BioBrick vector construction. We demonstrated the utility of the process by constructing seven new BioBrick vectors. We also successfully used the resulting vectors to assemble and propagate other BioBrick standard biological parts.ConclusionWe extended the principles of part reuse and standardization to BioBrick vectors. As a result, myriad new BioBrick vectors can be readily produced from all existing and newly designed BioBrick parts. We invite the synthetic biology community to (1) use the process to make and share new BioBrick vectors; (2) expand the current collection of BioBrick vector parts; and (3) characterize and improve the available collection of BioBrick vector parts.",

We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called \u2018Golden Gate\u2019 cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.",

However, the methods applied for bacterial genome engineering are still challenging and far from being standardized. Here, in an attempt to realize the simplest recombinant genome technology imaginable and facilitate the transition from recombinant plasmids to genomes, we create a simplistic methodology and a comprehensive strain collection called the Standardized Genome Architecture (SEGA). In its simplest form, SEGA enables genome engineering by combining only two reagents: a DNA fragment that can be ordered from a commercial vendor and a stock solution of bacterial cells followed by incubation on agar plates. Recombinant genomes are identified by visual inspection using green-white colony screening akin to classical blue-white screening for recombinant plasmids. The modular nature of SEGA allows precise multi-level control of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. The SEGA architecture simultaneously supports increased standardization of genetic designs and a broad application range by utilizing well-characterized parts optimized for robust performance in the context of the bacterial genome. Ultimately, its adaption and expansion by the scientific community should improve predictability and comparability of experimental outcomes across different laboratories. Genome engineering is challenging compared to plasmid DNA manipulation. Here the authors create a simple methodology called SEGA that enables genome engineering by combining DNA and bacterial cells followed by identification of recombinant clones by a change in colour when grown on agar plates.",

However, a notable disparity exists between its remarkable development and the need for standardization to facilitate seamless interoperability among systems. The field is thus impeded by an overwhelming proliferation of organism-specific systems that frequently lack compatibility. To overcome these issues, we present Golden Standard (GS), a Type IIS assembly method underpinned by the Standard European Vector Architecture. GS unlocks modular cloning applications for most bacteria, and delivers combinatorial multi-part assembly to create genetic circuits of up to twenty transcription units (TUs). Reliance on MoClo syntax renders GS fully compatible with many existing tools and it sets the path towards efficient reusability of available part libraries and assembled TUs. GS was validated in terms of DNA assembly, portability, interoperability and phenotype engineering in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-proteobacteria. Furthermore, we provide a computational pipeline for parts characterization that was used to assess the performance of GS parts. To promote community-driven development of GS, we provide a dedicated web-portal including a repository of parts, vectors, and Wizard and Setup tools that guide users in designing constructs. Overall, GS establishes an open, standardized framework propelling the progress of synthetic biology as a whole."

The sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools has developed as synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity. In the past 20 years, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity of efforts within the space of synthetic biology has occurred (Phelan et al., 2017). Due to the great development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to complicated refactoring efforts (Yamanaka et al., 2014)(Shao et al., 2013)(Temme et al., 2012) that can produce medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxadiene, etc.) (Brown et al., 2015)(Soliman et al., 2015) or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc.) (Park et al., 2007)(Lee et al., 2007) in a high titer...Among many systems available for heterologous protein production, the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli remains one of the most attractive organisms because of its ability to grow rapidly and at high density on inexpensive substrates. Well-characterized genetics and availability of a large number of cloning vectors and mutant host strains [9]. As a commonly used organism for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways, E. coli has been the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [10]11].",

Pathways for Thr degradation were removed by deleting tdh and mutating ilvA. The metA and lysA genes were deleted to make more precursors available for Thr biosynthesis. Further target genes to be engineered were identified by transcriptome profiling combined with in silico flux response analysis, and their expression levels were manipulated accordingly. The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce Thr with a high yield of 0.393 g per gram of glucose, and 82.4 g/l Thr by fed\u2010batch culture. The systems metabolic engineering strategy reported here may be broadly employed for developing genetically defined organisms for the efficient production of various bioproducts.",
                    "[3164113 | Shao et al. | 2013 | Citations: 150]": "Natural products (secondary metabolites) are a rich source of compounds with important biological activities. Eliciting pathway expression is always challenging but extremely important in natural product discovery because an individual pathway is tightly controlled through a unique regulation mechanism and hence often remains silent under the routine culturing conditions. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches that lack general applicability, we developed a simple synthetic biology approach that decouples pathway expression from complex native regulations. Briefly, the entire silent biosynthetic pathway is refactored using a plug-and-play scaffold and a set of heterologous promoters that are functional in a heterologous host under the target culturing condition. Using this strategy, we successfully awakened the silent spectinabilin pathway from Streptomyces orinoci. This strategy bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit pathway expression and represents a new platform for discovering novel natural products.",
                    "[6443731 | Phelan et al. | 2017 | Citations: 67]": "Streptomyces have a rich history as producers of important natural products and this genus of bacteria has recently garnered attention for its potential applications in the broader context of synthetic biology. However, the dearth of genetic tools available to control and monitor protein production precludes rapid and predictable metabolic engineering that is possible in hosts such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In an effort to improve genetic tools for Streptomyces venezuelae, we developed a suite of standardized, orthogonal integration vectors and an improved method to monitor protein production in this host. These tools were applied to characterize heterologous promoters and various attB chromosomal integration sites. A final study leveraged the characterized toolset to demonstrate its use in producing the biofuel precursor bisabolene using a chromosomally integrated expression system. These tools advance S. venezuelae to be a practical host for future metabolic engineering efforts."

Synthetic biology, which can be described as the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature (Serrano, 2007), has transformed how scientists can apply biology for the benefit of society. Well-characterised biological parts that are integrated into a well-known host (i.e. chassis) have resulted in many synthetic biology success stories, such as microbial artemisinin production for malaria treatment (Paddon et al., 2013) and automated systems for the construction of DNA-based logic circuits (Nielsen et al., 2016)."

In this respect, science is no exception. The new buzzword \u2018Systems Biology\u2019 entered the vocabulary of the scientific community only a few years ago. Now that every biologist is aware of it and almost everyone seems to be doing it, an even newer buzzword has entered the scientific arena, \u2018Synthetic Biology\u2019 (see as an example a sample of recent reviews on the topic, Benner and Sismour, 2005; Endy, 2005; Andrianantoandro et al , 2006; Heinemann and Panke, 2006).\n\nWe are still arguing about the true definition of Systems Biology, the more so since it became fashionable for the funding agencies and therefore any research project should include it in the proposal, and now we need to define Synthetic Biology and explain to the non\u2010specialist what the difference is between the two. Is Synthetic Biology something really new or is it simply Biotechnology (another old and outdated buzzword) in new packaging? What are the achievements so far, what can we expect from it and are any biosafety dangers lurking ahead? How is Europe doing in this field compared with other countries? In this brief article we will attempt to provide some answers to those questions.\n\nA consensus definition drafted by a group of European experts defined Synthetic Biology as follows: \u2018Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures\u2014from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues and organisms.

For synthetic biology, the various biological components of the complex problem being investigated are represented in terms of biological parts or devices. These biological parts or devices could be 'plugged-in' to a microbial chassis to address a given need. Once 'plugged-in' to the chassis, these parts begin interacting under the corresponding genetic programme which encodes the target function. \n\nWith the assistance of genetic engineering, synthetic biology has rapidly advanced over the last few years for certain well-characterized organisms such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis."

Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s (Cohen et al., 1973) . These scientific breakthroughs allowed scientists to manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways and opened the door for a wave of innovation in genetic engineering, such as the invention of polymerase chain reaction in 1983 4 , which allowed researchers to amplify DNA sequences for use in genetic manipulation."

                            "Synthetic biology is interpreted as the engineering-driven building of increasingly complex biological entities for novel applications. Encouraged by progress in the design of artificial gene networks, de novo DNA synthesis and protein engineering, we review the case for this emerging discipline. Key aspects of an engineering approach are purpose-orientation, deep insight into the underlying scientific principles, a hierarchy of abstraction including suitable interfaces between and within the levels of the hierarchy, standardization and the separation of design and fabrication. Synthetic biology investigates possibilities to implement these requirements into the process of engineering biological systems. This is illustrated on the DNA level by the implementation of engineering-inspired artificial operations such as toggle switching, oscillating or production of spatial patterns. On the protein level, the functionally self-contained domain structure of a number of proteins suggests possibilities for essentially Lego-like recombination which can be exploited for reprogramming DNA binding domain specificities or signaling pathways. Alternatively, computational design emerges to rationally reprogram enzyme function. Finally, the increasing facility of de novo DNA synthesis-synthetic biology's system fabrication process-supplies the possibility to implement novel designs for ever more complex systems. Some of these elements have merged to realize the first tangible synthetic biology applications in the area of manufacturing of pharmaceutical compounds."

The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago. This inspired attempts to describe biological regulation schemes with mathematical models and to apply circuit analogies from established frameworks in electrical engineering(McAdams & Arkin A,2000).

                            "Developing molecular communication platforms based on orthogonal communication channels is a crucial step towards engineering artificial multicellular systems. Here, we present a general and scalable platform entitled \u2018biomolecular implementation of protocellular communication\u2019 (BIO-PC) to engineer distributed multichannel molecular communication between populations of non-lipid semipermeable microcapsules. Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.Semipermeable proteinosome membranes allow complex DNA message communication through compartmentalization and protect the DNA circuits from degradation in a biological environment."

                            "BackgroundAs engineered biological systems become more complex, it is increasingly common to express multiple operons from different plasmids and inducible expression systems within a single host cell. Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.ResultsHere, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number.ConclusionsThe standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized."

For instance, the following have altogether enabled characterization of the bacterial host and recombinant proteins at the systems level: a large influx of high-throughput information on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites that enabled visualization of the global landscape of transcriptional and translational processes (Cho et al., 2009)(Nakahigashi et al., 2009); availability of robust computational tools and in silico models streamlining detailed analysis and prediction of the cellular networks; and rapid advances in DNA synthesis, assembly techniques that facilitated the process to build and test the designed biological systems (Gibson et al., 2009)[28]."

                            "Central carbon metabolism is a basic and exhaustively analyzed pathway. However, the intrinsic robustness of the pathway might still conceal uncharacterized reactions. To test this hypothesis, we constructed systematic multiple\u2010knockout mutants involved in central carbon catabolism in Escherichia coli and tested their growth under 12 different nutrient conditions. Differences between in silico predictions and experimental growth indicated that unreported reactions existed within this extensively analyzed metabolic network. These putative reactions were then confirmed by metabolome analysis and in vitro enzymatic assays. Novel reactions regarding the breakdown of sedoheptulose\u20107\u2010phosphate to erythrose\u20104\u2010phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were observed in transaldolase\u2010deficient mutants, without any noticeable changes in gene expression. These reactions, triggered by an accumulation of sedoheptulose\u20107\u2010phosphate, were catalyzed by the universally conserved glycolytic enzymes ATP\u2010dependent phosphofructokinase and aldolase. The emergence of an alternative pathway not requiring any changes in gene expression, but rather relying on the accumulation of an intermediate metabolite may be a novel mechanism mediating the robustness of these metabolic networks."

                            "In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century (Baneyx, 1999). Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts (Yamanaka et al., 2014)(Shao et al., 2013)(Temme et al., 2012) that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) (Brown et al., 2015)(Soliman et al., 2015) or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) (Park et al., 2007)(Lee et al., 2007). Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors (Lee et al., 2011), promoters for dynamic pathway control (Dahl et al., 2013)(Zhang et al., 2012), tunable protein degradation (Cameron et al., 2014), and advanced methods for genome editing (Wang et al., 2009)(Hsu et al., 2014)."

                            "BackgroundAs engineered biological systems become more complex, it is increasingly common to express multiple operons from different plasmids and inducible expression systems within a single host cell. Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.ResultsHere, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number.ConclusionsThe standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized."

                            "BackgroundThe underlying goal of synthetic biology is to make the process of engineering biological systems easier. Recent work has focused on defining and developing standard biological parts. The technical standard that has gained the most traction in the synthetic biology community is the BioBrick standard for physical composition of genetic parts. Parts that conform to the BioBrick assembly standard are BioBrick standard biological parts. To date, over 2,000 BioBrick parts have been contributed to, and are available from, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.ResultsHere we extended the same advantages of BioBrick standard biological parts to the plasmid-based vectors that are used to provide and propagate BioBrick parts. We developed a process for engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts. We designed a new set of BioBrick parts that encode many useful vector functions. We combined the new parts to make a BioBrick base vector that facilitates BioBrick vector construction. We demonstrated the utility of the process by constructing seven new BioBrick vectors. We also successfully used the resulting vectors to assemble and propagate other BioBrick standard biological parts.ConclusionWe extended the principles of part reuse and standardization to BioBrick vectors. As a result, myriad new BioBrick vectors can be readily produced from all existing and newly designed BioBrick parts. We invite the synthetic biology community to (1) use the process to make and share new BioBrick vectors; (2) expand the current collection of BioBrick vector parts; and (3) characterize and improve the available collection of BioBrick vector parts."

We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called \u2018Golden Gate\u2019 cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation."

However, the methods applied for bacterial genome engineering are still challenging and far from being standardized. Here, in an attempt to realize the simplest recombinant genome technology imaginable and facilitate the transition from recombinant plasmids to genomes, we create a simplistic methodology and a comprehensive strain collection called the Standardized Genome Architecture (SEGA). In its simplest form, SEGA enables genome engineering by combining only two reagents: a DNA fragment that can be ordered from a commercial vendor and a stock solution of bacterial cells followed by incubation on agar plates. Recombinant genomes are identified by visual inspection using green-white colony screening akin to classical blue-white screening for recombinant plasmids. The modular nature of SEGA allows precise multi-level control of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. The SEGA architecture simultaneously supports increased standardization of genetic designs and a broad application range by utilizing well-characterized parts optimized for robust performance in the context of the bacterial genome. Ultimately, its adaption and expansion by the scientific community should improve predictability and comparability of experimental outcomes across different laboratories. Genome engineering is challenging compared to plasmid DNA manipulation. Here the authors create a simple methodology called SEGA that enables genome engineering by combining DNA and bacterial cells followed by identification of recombinant clones by a change in colour when grown on agar plates."

                            "Abstract Modular cloning has become a benchmark technology in synthetic biology. However, a notable disparity exists between its remarkable development and the need for standardization to facilitate seamless interoperability among systems. The field is thus impeded by an overwhelming proliferation of organism-specific systems that frequently lack compatibility. To overcome these issues, we present Golden Standard (GS), a Type IIS assembly method underpinned by the Standard European Vector Architecture. GS unlocks modular cloning applications for most bacteria, and delivers combinatorial multi-part assembly to create genetic circuits of up to twenty transcription units (TUs). Reliance on MoClo syntax renders GS fully compatible with many existing tools and it sets the path towards efficient reusability of available part libraries and assembled TUs. GS was validated in terms of DNA assembly, portability, interoperability and phenotype engineering in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-proteobacteria. Furthermore, we provide a computational pipeline for parts characterization that was used to assess the performance of GS parts. To promote community-driven development of GS, we provide a dedicated web-portal including a repository of parts, vectors, and Wizard and Setup tools that guide users in designing constructs. Overall, GS establishes an open, standardized framework propelling the progress of synthetic biology as a whole."

However, the dearth of genetic tools available to control and monitor protein production precludes rapid and predictable metabolic engineering that is possible in hosts such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In an effort to improve genetic tools for Streptomyces venezuelae, we developed a suite of standardized, orthogonal integration vectors and an improved method to monitor protein production in this host. These tools were applied to characterize heterologous promoters and various attB chromosomal integration sites. A final study leveraged the characterized toolset to demonstrate its use in producing the biofuel precursor bisabolene using a chromosomally integrated expression system. These tools advance S. venezuelae to be a practical host for future metabolic engineering efforts."

Here, we report the use of type II bacterial CRISPR-Cas system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for genome engineering. The CRISPR-Cas components, Cas9 gene and a designer genome targeting CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), show robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci in yeast. Using constitutive Cas9 expression and a transient gRNA cassette, we show that targeted double-strand breaks can increase homologous recombination rates of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotide donors by 5-fold and 130-fold, respectively. In addition, co-transformation of a gRNA plasmid and a donor DNA in cells constitutively expressing Cas9 resulted in near 100% donor DNA recombination frequency. Our approach provides foundations for a simple and powerful genome engineering tool for site-specific mutagenesis and allelic replacement in yeast."

The establishment of targeted gene-disrupted zebrafish (knockouts) is readily achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification. Recently, exogenous DNA integration into the zebrafish genome via homology-independent DNA repair was reported, but this integration contained various mutations at the junctions of genomic and integrated DNA. Thus, precise genome modification into targeted genomic loci remains to be achieved. Here, we describe efficient, precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration using a donor vector harbouring short homologous sequences (10\u201340\u2005bp) flanking the genomic target locus. We succeeded in integrating with high efficiency an exogenous mCherry or eGFP gene into targeted genes (tyrosinase and krtt1c19e) in frame. We found the precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA without backbone vector sequences when Cas9 cleavage sites were introduced at both sides of the left homology arm, the eGFP sequence and the right homology arm. Furthermore, we confirmed that this precise genome modification was heritable. This simple method enables precise targeted gene knock-in in zebrafish."

Eliciting pathway expression is always challenging but extremely important in natural product discovery because an individual pathway is tightly controlled through a unique regulation mechanism and hence often remains silent under the routine culturing conditions. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches that lack general applicability, we developed a simple synthetic biology approach that decouples pathway expression from complex native regulations. Briefly, the entire silent biosynthetic pathway is refactored using a plug-and-play scaffold and a set of heterologous promoters that are functional in a heterologous host under the target culturing condition. Using this strategy, we successfully awakened the silent spectinabilin pathway from Streptomyces orinoci. This strategy bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit pathway expression and represents a new platform for discovering novel natural products."

                            "Metabolic engineering emerged 20 years ago as the discipline occupied with the directed modification of metabolic pathways for the microbial synthesis of various products. As such, it deals with the engineering (design, construction, and optimization) of native as well as non-natural routes of product synthesis, aided in this task by the availability of synthetic DNA, the core enabling technology of synthetic biology. The two fields, however, only partially overlap in their interest in pathway engineering. While fabrication of biobricks, synthetic cells, genetic circuits, and nonlinear cell dynamics, along with pathway engineering, have occupied researchers in the field of synthetic biology, the sum total of these areas does not constitute a coherent definition of synthetic biology with a distinct intellectual foundation and well-defined areas of application. This paper reviews the origins of the two fields and advances two distinct paradigms for each of them: that of unit operations for metabolic engineering and electronic circuits for synthetic biology. In this context, metabolic engineering is about engineering cell factories for the biological manufacturing of chemical and pharmaceutical products, whereas the main focus of synthetic biology is fundamental biological research facilitated by the use of synthetic DNA and genetic circuits."

                            "In the rapidly expanding field of synthetic biology, preprogrammed cellular behavior is attempted to be created and realized utilizing both natural and synthetic biological components. Numerous biotechnological advancements, ranging from sophisticated medicines to the biosynthesis of chemical products, have been made because of this form of forward engineering (Ullah et al., 2016). The development and fast analysis of extensive libraries of genetic components by nextgeneration sequencing techniques facilitated the advancement in the research related to the biosynthesis of chemical products. Synthetic cell-to-cell communication, intricate and expansive genomic circuits, and CRISPR-based regulation are noteworthy advancements (Markowiak-Kope\u0107 et al., 2020). Synthetic biology offers a way to research structure-function interactions among bacteria and create new biotic treatments in the field of microbiota engineering. The ability of the designed microorganism to perceive, record, and react to its immediate environment is expanded by incorporating synthetic genetic components (Bober et al., 2018). Synthetic biology is essential to post-biotic production because it allows for the efficient and sustainable manufacture of useful substances using living organisms or biological components. Furthermore, synthetic biology has made it possible to build biofactories where created cells manufacture medicines like insulin and vaccines, providing more affordable and scalable production techniques (Fenster et al., 2019)."

                            "To successfully deliver probiotic benefits to the consumer, several criteria must be met. Here, we discuss the often-forgotten challenges in manufacturing the strains and incorporating them in consumer products that provide the required dose at the end of shelf life. For manufacturing, an intricate production process is required that ensures both high yield and stability and must also be able to meet requirements such as the absence of specific allergens, which precludes some obvious culture media ingredients. Reproducibility is important to ensure constant high performance and quality. To ensure this, quality control throughout the whole production process, from raw materials to the final product, is essential, as is the documentation of this quality control. Consumer product formulation requires extensive skill and experience. Traditionally, probiotic lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria have been incorporated in fermented dairy products, with limited shelf life and refrigerated storage. Currently, probiotics may be incorporated in dietary supplements and other \"dry\" food matrices which are expected to have up to 24 months of stability at ambient temperature and humidity. With the right choice of production process, product formulation, and strains, high-quality probiotics can be successfully included in a wide variety of delivery formats to suit consumer requirements."
