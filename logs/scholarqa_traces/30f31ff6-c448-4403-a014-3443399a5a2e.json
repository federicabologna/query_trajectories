                    "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutic agents that are comprised of a monoclonal antibody tethered to a potent cytotoxic molecule through a chemical linker. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several ADCs has provided tremendous impetus to research in this field. Most ADCs approved or in clinical development employ traditional conjugation methods that are either lysine-amide coupling or cysteine-maleimide conjugation to tether the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. These methods, though simple to use, produce heterogeneous conjugates complicating analytical characterization and batch reproducibility. The cysteine-maleimide conjugation strategy faces an additional problem of serum instability [1]. To address the shortcomings of classical conjugation, the ADC field is gradually moving towards site-specific conjugation approaches. The site-specific approaches improve the homogeneity of ADC products, the manufacturability and the ease of characterization [2,3]. Further, in certain cases, site-specific conjugates have been reported to show improved efficacy, stability and safety [4][5][6]. \n\nTo date, numerous site-specific conjugation approaches have been developed, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Despite the availability of a plethora of site-specific conjugation approaches, most methods developed to date lead to a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of only two. Branched linkers based on site-specific conjugation approaches may be used for loading multiple payload molecules onto an antibody but have not been fully explored. These linkers may lead to site-specific high-DAR antibody-drug conjugates with minimal disruption to the antibody structure and may even enhance ADC efficacy. To date, only a handful of branched linkers have been described in the literature that could lead to a high DAR in a site-specific manner. Anamiet et al. developed branched linkers utilizing microbial transglutaminase-mediated site-specific conjugation to provide a platform for attaining a DAR of 4 [7].",

                    "text": "Cysteine residues of monoclonal antibodies remain a popular site for conjugation and are most often targeted by maleimide-based payloads. However, the newly formed thiosuccinimide ring resulting from thiol-maleimide chemistry is susceptible to thiol exchange or retro-Michael addition, resulting in premature drug release leading to lower efficacy and increased off-target toxicity [12]. One way to overcome the instability of thiol-maleimide conjugation is to use alternative conjugation methods leading to plasma stable thioethers at cysteine in a rapid and efficient manner. The reaction of thiol with the iodoacetyl group to form a stable thioether bond is one such conjugation technique and has been previously employed for making ADCs [12][13][14][15]. The design of branched heterofunctional linkers for obtaining high-DAR ADCs is shown in Figure 2. Each of the described branched linkers uses the iodoacetyl reacting group to conjugate cysteine-inserted antibodies in an efficient manner at elevated pH to form a stable thioether linkage. The linkers carry cyclic dienes which react efficiently via the Diels-Alder reaction with commonly available maleimide payloads to form plasma stable ADCs [16]. Our DAR 4 linker (D4) carries two cyclic dienes capable of reacting with two maleimide payloads, while our DAR 6 linker (D6) carries three and DAR 8 linker (D8) carries four cyclic diene units. While each of our D4 and D6 linkers carry a short spacer to conjugate free cysteines in an antibody, our D8 linker carries a diethylene glycol unit (PEG 2) to overcome any potential steric hinderance caused by the bulky nature of the linker. The synthesis of the designed branched linkers is described in Scheme 1 (detailed procedure for the intermediates can be found in the Supplementary Information). The synthesis of the D4 and D8 linkers used commercially available serinol, while the D6 linker started from commercially available tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (tris base).",

Mao, N. Dimasi, Changshou Gao\n## Abstract\nFirst-generation cysteine-based site-specific antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are limited to one drug per cysteine. However, certain applications require a high drug to antibody ratio (DAR), such as when low-potency payloads are used. Higher drug load can be achieved using classical cysteine conjugation methods, but these result in heterogeneity, suboptimal efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and validation of heterobifunctional linkers that can be used for the preparation of ADCs with a DAR of two, three and four in a site-specific manner per single cysteine conjugation site, resulting in site-specific ADCs with a DAR of four, six and eight. The designed linkers carry a sulfhydryl-specific iodoacetyl reactive group, and multiple cyclic diene moieties which can efficiently react with maleimide-carrying payloads through the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. As a proof of concept, we synthesized site-specific DAR four, six and eight ADCs carrying tubulysin (AZ13601508) using engineered antibodies with a cysteine inserted after position 239 in the antibody CH2 domain. We evaluated and compared the in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCs obtained via the site-specific platform described herein, with ADCs prepared using classical cysteine conjugation. Our data validated a novel cysteine-based conjugation platform for the preparation of site-specific ADCs with high drug load for therapeutic applications.\n## Introduction\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutic agents that are comprised of a monoclonal antibody tethered to a potent cytotoxic molecule through a chemical linker. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several ADCs has provided tremendous impetus to research in this field. Most ADCs approved or in clinical development employ traditional conjugation methods that are either lysine-amide coupling or cysteine-maleimide conjugation to tether the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. These methods, though simple to use, produce heterogeneous conjugates complicating analytical characterization and batch reproducibility. The cysteine-maleimide conjugation strategy faces an additional problem of serum instability [1]. To address the shortcomings of classical conjugation, the ADC field is gradually moving towards site-specific conjugation approaches. The site-specific approaches improve the homogeneity of ADC products, the manufacturability and the ease of characterization [2,3]. Further, in certain cases, site-specific conjugates have been reported to show improved efficacy, stability and safety [4][5][6]. \n\nTo date, numerous site-specific conjugation approaches have been developed, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Despite the availability of a plethora of site-specific conjugation approaches, most methods developed to date lead to a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of only two. Branched linkers based on site-specific conjugation approaches may be used for loading multiple payload molecules onto an antibody but have not been fully explored. These linkers may lead to site-specific high-DAR antibody-drug conjugates with minimal disruption to the antibody structure and may even enhance ADC efficacy. To date, only a handful of branched linkers have been described in the literature that could lead to a high DAR in a site-specific manner. Anamiet et al. developed branched linkers utilizing microbial transglutaminase-mediated site-specific conjugation to provide a platform for attaining a DAR of 4 [7].\n\n## Results and Discussion\nCysteine residues of monoclonal antibodies remain a popular site for conjugation and are most often targeted by maleimide-based payloads. However, the newly formed thiosuccinimide ring resulting from thiol-maleimide chemistry is susceptible to thiol exchange or retro-Michael addition, resulting in premature drug release leading to lower efficacy and increased off-target toxicity [12]. One way to overcome the instability of thiol-maleimide conjugation is to use alternative conjugation methods leading to plasma stable thioethers at cysteine in a rapid and efficient manner. The reaction of thiol with the iodoacetyl group to form a stable thioether bond is one such conjugation technique and has been previously employed for making ADCs [12][13][14][15]. The design of branched heterofunctional linkers for obtaining high-DAR ADCs is shown in Figure 2. Each of the described branched linkers uses the iodoacetyl reacting group to conjugate cysteine-inserted antibodies in an efficient manner at elevated pH to form a stable thioether linkage. The linkers carry cyclic dienes which react efficiently via the Diels-Alder reaction with commonly available maleimide payloads to form plasma stable ADCs [16]. Our DAR 4 linker (D4) carries two cyclic dienes capable of reacting with two maleimide payloads, while our DAR 6 linker (D6) carries three and DAR 8 linker (D8) carries four cyclic diene units. While each of our D4 and D6 linkers carry a short spacer to conjugate free cysteines in an antibody, our D8 linker carries a diethylene glycol unit (PEG 2) to overcome any potential steric hinderance caused by the bulky nature of the linker. The synthesis of the designed branched linkers is described in Scheme 1 (detailed procedure for the intermediates can be found in the Supplementary Information). The synthesis of the D4 and D8 linkers used commercially available serinol, while the D6 linker started from commercially available tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (tris base).",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a potent cancer therapy by selectively delivering cytotoxic payloads to tumors. However, they face limitations due to acquired resistance and adverse effects. New ADC formats, such as bispecific ADCs and probody\u2013drug conjugates, offer potential solutions. Nevertheless, single-domain antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, present a promising alternative. VHHs possess unique characteristics over ADCs, including a smaller size, enhanced tissue penetration, and rapid clearance. Their stability, solubility, and manufacturability surpass those of conventional antibodies, enabling cost-effective production and expanding the range of targetable antigens. Therefore, VHHs can mitigate some of the risks associated with conventional ADCs, representing an exciting prospect for next-generation ADCs. Abstract Background: Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent potent cancer therapies that deliver highly toxic drugs to tumor cells precisely, thus allowing for targeted treatment and significantly reducing off-target effects. Despite their effectiveness, ADCs can face limitations due to acquired resistance and potential side effects. Objectives: This study focuses on advances in various ADC components to improve both the efficacy and safety of these agents, and includes the analysis of several novel ADC formats. This work assesses whether the unique features of VHHs\u2014such as their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, stability, and cost-effectiveness\u2014make them a viable alternative to conventional antibodies for ADCs and reviews their current status in ADC development. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, this study focused on VHHs as components of ADCs, examining advancements and prospects from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2024. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and LILACS using specific terms related to ADCs and single-domain antibodies. Retrieved articles were rigorously evaluated, excluding duplicates and non-qualifying studies. The selected peer-reviewed articles were analyzed for quality and synthesized to highlight advancements, methods, payloads, and future directions in ADC research. Results: VHHs offer significant advantages for drug conjugation over conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and structure, which enhance tissue penetration and enable access to previously inaccessible epitopes. Their superior stability, solubility, and manufacturability facilitate cost-effective production and expand the range of targetable antigens. Additionally, some VHHs can naturally cross the blood\u2013brain barrier or be easily modified to favor their penetration, making them promising for targeting brain tumors and metastases. Although no VHH\u2013drug conjugates (nADC or nanoADC) are currently in the clinical arena, preclinical studies have explored various conjugation methods and linkers. Conclusions: While ADCs are transforming cancer treatment, their unique mechanisms and associated toxicities challenge traditional views on bioavailability and vary with different tumor types. Severe toxicities, often linked to compound instability, off-target effects, and nonspecific blood cell interactions, highlight the need for better understanding. Conversely, the rapid distribution, tumor penetration, and clearance of VHHs could be advantageous, potentially reducing toxicity by minimizing prolonged exposure. These attributes make single-domain antibodies strong candidates for the next generation of ADCs, potentially enhancing both efficacy and safety.",

                    "text": "Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

J. Schuhmacher\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a potent cancer therapy by selectively delivering cytotoxic payloads to tumors. However, they face limitations due to acquired resistance and adverse effects. New ADC formats, such as bispecific ADCs and probody\u2013drug conjugates, offer potential solutions. Nevertheless, single-domain antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, present a promising alternative. VHHs possess unique characteristics over ADCs, including a smaller size, enhanced tissue penetration, and rapid clearance. Their stability, solubility, and manufacturability surpass those of conventional antibodies, enabling cost-effective production and expanding the range of targetable antigens. Therefore, VHHs can mitigate some of the risks associated with conventional ADCs, representing an exciting prospect for next-generation ADCs. Abstract Background: Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent potent cancer therapies that deliver highly toxic drugs to tumor cells precisely, thus allowing for targeted treatment and significantly reducing off-target effects. Despite their effectiveness, ADCs can face limitations due to acquired resistance and potential side effects. Objectives: This study focuses on advances in various ADC components to improve both the efficacy and safety of these agents, and includes the analysis of several novel ADC formats. This work assesses whether the unique features of VHHs\u2014such as their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, stability, and cost-effectiveness\u2014make them a viable alternative to conventional antibodies for ADCs and reviews their current status in ADC development. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, this study focused on VHHs as components of ADCs, examining advancements and prospects from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2024. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and LILACS using specific terms related to ADCs and single-domain antibodies. Retrieved articles were rigorously evaluated, excluding duplicates and non-qualifying studies. The selected peer-reviewed articles were analyzed for quality and synthesized to highlight advancements, methods, payloads, and future directions in ADC research. Results: VHHs offer significant advantages for drug conjugation over conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and structure, which enhance tissue penetration and enable access to previously inaccessible epitopes. Their superior stability, solubility, and manufacturability facilitate cost-effective production and expand the range of targetable antigens. Additionally, some VHHs can naturally cross the blood\u2013brain barrier or be easily modified to favor their penetration, making them promising for targeting brain tumors and metastases. Although no VHH\u2013drug conjugates (nADC or nanoADC) are currently in the clinical arena, preclinical studies have explored various conjugation methods and linkers. Conclusions: While ADCs are transforming cancer treatment, their unique mechanisms and associated toxicities challenge traditional views on bioavailability and vary with different tumor types. Severe toxicities, often linked to compound instability, off-target effects, and nonspecific blood cell interactions, highlight the need for better understanding. Conversely, the rapid distribution, tumor penetration, and clearance of VHHs could be advantageous, potentially reducing toxicity by minimizing prolonged exposure. These attributes make single-domain antibodies strong candidates for the next generation of ADCs, potentially enhancing both efficacy and safety.\n## Linkers and Conjugation Process\nSpecific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

The coupling activity of MTGase was applied to synthesize antibody-drug conjugates [83][84][85]. For example, Dennler et al. [83] afforded a highly homogeneous trastuzumab-MMAE conjugate with DAR of 2 using this enzymatic conjugation strategy. In this work, an azide-containing linker, which involves a primary amine, was coupled to Q295 of the deglycosylated antibody by MTGase. This enzymatic reaction was followed by a SPAAC reaction with the DBCO-containing auristatin drug. \n\nCell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system was also efficiently applied to produce monoclonal antibodies that contain unnatural amino acids for antibody-drug conjugate generations.",

One of the biggest challenges in the development of ADCs is the application of suitable linkers for conjugating drugs to antibodies. Recently, the design and synthesis of linkers are making great progress. In this review, we present the methods that are currently used to synthesize antibody-drug conjugates by using thiols, amines, alcohols, aldehydes and azides.\n## Conclusions\nA promising approach to improve the potency of drugs is to be conjugated to monoclonal antibodies that enable these cytotoxic drugs to be site-specifically delivered to tumor cells while avoiding the toxicity of drugs on normal cells. The linkers of antibody-drug conjugates profoundly impact their potency and safety. Recently, a variety of methods have been developed to conjugate drugs to antibodies. In this review, we summarized the methods that are currently used to design and synthesize antibody-drug conjugates, including heterogeneous ADCs and homogeneous ADCs, via various functional groups such as thiols, amines, alcohols, aldehydes and azides. Heterogeneous Scheme 18. The synthesis of ADCs through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) click reactions. Adapted from reference [81]. \n\nMicrobial transglutaminase (MTGase) can catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the amine group of glutamine and the primary amine of lysine while simultaneously releasing an ammonia gas [82]. The coupling activity of MTGase was applied to synthesize antibody-drug conjugates [83][84][85]. For example, Dennler et al. [83] afforded a highly homogeneous trastuzumab-MMAE conjugate with DAR of 2 using this enzymatic conjugation strategy. In this work, an azide-containing linker, which involves a primary amine, was coupled to Q295 of the deglycosylated antibody by MTGase. This enzymatic reaction was followed by a SPAAC reaction with the DBCO-containing auristatin drug. \n\nCell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system was also efficiently applied to produce monoclonal antibodies that contain unnatural amino acids for antibody-drug conjugate generations.\n...\nA promising approach to improve the potency of drugs is to be conjugated to monoclonal antibodies that enable these cytotoxic drugs to be site-specifically delivered to tumor cells while avoiding the toxicity of drugs on normal cells. The linkers of antibody-drug conjugates profoundly impact their potency and safety. Recently, a variety of methods have been developed to conjugate drugs to antibodies. In this review, we summarized the methods that are currently used to design and synthesize antibody-drug conjugates, including heterogeneous ADCs and homogeneous ADCs, via various functional groups such as thiols, amines, alcohols, aldehydes and azides. Heterogeneous ADCs were usually synthesized through the thiols of cysteine residues and the amines of lysines, however, the heterogeneity diminished their activities and promoted antibody aggregations, and increased toxicities in the circulation. Homogeneous ADCs made through the catalysis of site-specific conjugation enzymes such as AGT, BTG, aaRS and Sial T are more stable and have comparable or even better activities than those conventional analogs in vivo. We believe that a growing number of methods will be developed to synthesize ADCs in the near future, and more and more ADCs, especially site-specifically modified ADCs, will be produced.",

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

G. de la Torre, F. Albericio\n## Abstract\nAs one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.\n## Linker Chemistry and Conjugation to Antibody\nThe linker, which is the focus of this review, is an essential component in ADC design.It connects the antibody to the cytotoxic payload via covalent conjugation [26,[48][49][50].The key requirement of a linker is that it must ensure chemical stability of the ADC within the bloodstream (i.e., have a half-life 10 times longer than the ADC) and allow for rapid release of the payload at the target site after internalization [51,52].In addition to the above parameters that minimize premature drug release [39], hydro/lipophilicity, a property that enhances the coupling of payloads and reduces immunogenicity, is also a key aspect of linkers [53,54].\n\nTwo types of linkers, namely cleavable and non-cleavable, are used in ADC development (Figure 3).These linkers play major roles in determining pharmacokinetic properties, selectivity, therapeutic index, and the overall success of the ADC.With the development of ADCs, a series of linkers have been exploited [37].Cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials.Linkers are broadly classified on the basis of the drug release mechanism and their stability in circulation [55,56].\n\n## Conjugation Strategies\nThe success of an ADC depends mainly on the conjugation strategy.Two main types of conjugation are used in ADC design, namely chemical and enzymatic approaches.Most ADCs exploit the presence of Lys and Cys residues at the junction sites of the antibody, which can be modified for directional coupling.A typical IgG 1 antibody molecule has roughly 90 Lys residues, of which approximately 30 can be modified for conjugation, implying that between 1 and 30 payloads can be covalently coupled to the antibody.The amine group of Lys and sulfhydryl of Cys are used for the chemical conjugation of the antibody-linker [77].\n\nGenerally, amide coupling is the method of choice for the chemical conjugation of payload and antibody Lys residues using activated carboxylic acid esters as linkers.This type of coupling gives a high-yielding ADC.The primary amine in Lys easily reacts with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters introduced into the drug-linker, forming a stable amide, and a great number of commercial linkers rely on this method (Figure 17) [16,105].\n\namine group of Lys and sulfhydryl of Cys are used for the chemical conjugation of the antibody-linker [77].\n\nGenerally, amide coupling is the method of choice for the chemical conjugation of payload and antibody Lys residues using activated carboxylic acid esters as linkers.This type of coupling gives a high-yielding ADC.The primary amine in Lys easily reacts with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters introduced into the drug-linker, forming a stable amide, and a great number of commercial linkers rely on this method (Figure 17) [16,105].Cys are present in the antibodies and form disulfide bridges.Under careful reduction conditions, the disulfide bridge can be reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) or DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) to afford reactive thiol groups; meanwhile, intrachain disulfide bonds retain their unique state.",

The future of ADCs looks particularly promising due to several key factors: (i) Advances in linker technology, which connects the antibody to the drug, are expected to enhance the stability and controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. Improved linkers will increase the therapeutic window and reduce off-target effects, making ADCs safer and more effective.",

The integration of these two therapeutic modalities offers the potential to enhance and broaden pharmacology while minimizing dose-dependent toxicology. This review summarizes numerous advances in drug design, synthesis and development that provide direction for next-generation research endeavors in this field. Medicinal studies in this area have largely focused upon the application of peptides to selectively enhance small molecule cytotoxicity to more effectively treat multiple oncologic diseases. To a lesser and steadily emerging extent peptides are being therapeutically employed to complement and diversify the pharmacology of small molecule drugs in diseases other than just cancer. No matter the disease, the purpose of the molecular integration remains constant and it is to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes with diminished adverse effects. We review linker technology and conjugation chemistries that have enabled integrated and targeted pharmacology with controlled release. Finally, we offer our perspective on opportunities and obstacles in the field.",

Finally, disulfide bonds are extensively employed in peptide-drug conjugates, owing to what can be high plasma stability, and yet well-known intracellular cleavage by disulfide reduction. Their stability can be further enhanced through the addition of one or two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide bond. Hence, hydrazone, ester, amide, disulfide, dipeptide, tripeptide, and glucuronide-based linkers provide a diverse set of linkers that can meet most needs in the assembly of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted delivery (Figure 8). In ADCs, the linker is installed by conjugation of the linker-drug moiety to the antibody which most often occurs on the reactive surface residues of antibodies such as cysteine and lysine residues [68,200,[210][211][212][213]. The conjugation is a very critical step in ADC synthesis since typically there are multiple cysteine and lysine residues and without optimization results in a heterogeneous distribution in site and number of drugs that are loaded to the antibody. Molecular engineering and enzymatic modification have provided non-native amino acids to facilitate site-specific conjugation, but there remain technical challenges in commercial-scale production of homogenous ADCs [60,[214][215][216].

Mayer, R. DiMarchi\n## Abstract\nPeptides constitute molecular diversity with unique molecular mechanisms of action that are proven indispensable in the management of many human diseases, but of only a mere fraction relative to more traditional small molecule-based medicines. The integration of these two therapeutic modalities offers the potential to enhance and broaden pharmacology while minimizing dose-dependent toxicology. This review summarizes numerous advances in drug design, synthesis and development that provide direction for next-generation research endeavors in this field. Medicinal studies in this area have largely focused upon the application of peptides to selectively enhance small molecule cytotoxicity to more effectively treat multiple oncologic diseases. To a lesser and steadily emerging extent peptides are being therapeutically employed to complement and diversify the pharmacology of small molecule drugs in diseases other than just cancer. No matter the disease, the purpose of the molecular integration remains constant and it is to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes with diminished adverse effects. We review linker technology and conjugation chemistries that have enabled integrated and targeted pharmacology with controlled release. Finally, we offer our perspective on opportunities and obstacles in the field.\n## Linker and Conjugation Chemistry\nHence, hydrazone, ester, amide, disulfide, dipeptide, tripeptide, and glucuronide-based linkers provide a diverse set of linkers that can meet most needs in the assembly of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted delivery (Figure 8). \n\nMolecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 33 lysosomes and overexpressed in certain tumors [208,209]. Finally, disulfide bonds are extensively employed in peptide-drug conjugates, owing to what can be high plasma stability, and yet well-known intracellular cleavage by disulfide reduction. Their stability can be further enhanced through the addition of one or two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide bond. Hence, hydrazone, ester, amide, disulfide, dipeptide, tripeptide, and glucuronide-based linkers provide a diverse set of linkers that can meet most needs in the assembly of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted delivery (Figure 8). In ADCs, the linker is installed by conjugation of the linker-drug moiety to the antibody which most often occurs on the reactive surface residues of antibodies such as cysteine and lysine residues [68,200,[210][211][212][213]. The conjugation is a very critical step in ADC synthesis since typically there are multiple cysteine and lysine residues and without optimization results in a heterogeneous distribution in site and number of drugs that are loaded to the antibody. Molecular engineering and enzymatic modification have provided non-native amino acids to facilitate site-specific conjugation, but there remain technical challenges in commercial-scale production of homogenous ADCs [60,[214][215][216]. Peptide-drug conjugates benefit in employing total chemical synthesis that involves orthogonal side chain protection to control product integrity.",

                    "text": "In the era of immunotherapy, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is rising as a promising therapeutic modality. One attractive aspect of this modality is that a new linker leads to the registration of a new biologics entity in terms of intellectual property rights, 190 allowing a huge advantage in patent space and novelty. \n\nNanobodies, 191 non-Ig-Based protein scaffolds such as DAR-Pins, 192 and peptide aptamers 193 are rising as alternatives to monoclonal antibodies with their competitive advantages (higher affinity binding, lower cost, and lower immunogenicity relative to mAbs). A wider toolbox of native amino acid conjugation methods which are orthogonal thus complementary to existing ones' synthetic scopes will open wider avenues to prepare biomolecule conjugates. \n\nOrthodox bioconjugation methods are rooted in the nucleophilicity of substituents on amino acids and therefore, the functionalisation of non-nucleophilic amino acids, such as valine, leucine, or phenylalanine, remains a challenge. An extension of metal-free, rapid and aqueous synthetic methodologies in C-H activation will provide a wider pool of potential designs for antibody conjugation linkers. \n\nWhile many reactions are reported for native amino acid functionalisation to produce antibody or protein-payload conjugate, only few has succeeded to do it in nearly 100% aqueous medium, within a short enough duration, without any potentially denaturing agents. Last but not least, atom-economy is highly important for the antibody conjugation efficiency. While disul\ue103de rebridging linker is emerging as a promising approach to control Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR), a recent preclinical study suggests that a strict control of DAR may not be the most critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy. 58 It seems that more thorough and detailed studies on different combinations of antibody, drug, linker's chemistry and conjugation site are required in order to better understand ADC's therapeutic pro\ue103le. We envisage that antibody-payload conjugates will expand their indications beyond cancer, with the development of good linkers.",

Loh\n## Abstract\nMany fields in chemical biology and synthetic biology require effective bioconjugation methods to achieve their desired functions and activities. Among such biomolecule conjugates, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) need a linker that provides a stable linkage between cytotoxic drugs and antibodies, whilst conjugating in a biologically benign, fast and selective fashion. This review focuses on how the development of novel organic synthesis can solve the problems of traditional linker technology. The review shall introduce and analyse the current developments in the modification of native amino acids on peptides or proteins and their applicability to ADC linker. Thereafter, the review shall discuss in detail each endogenous amino acid's intrinsic reactivity and selectivity aspects, and address the research effort to construct an ADC using each conjugation method.\n## Summary and future outlook\nIn the era of immunotherapy, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is rising as a promising therapeutic modality. One attractive aspect of this modality is that a new linker leads to the registration of a new biologics entity in terms of intellectual property rights, 190 allowing a huge advantage in patent space and novelty. \n\nNanobodies, 191 non-Ig-Based protein scaffolds such as DAR-Pins, 192 and peptide aptamers 193 are rising as alternatives to monoclonal antibodies with their competitive advantages (higher affinity binding, lower cost, and lower immunogenicity relative to mAbs). A wider toolbox of native amino acid conjugation methods which are orthogonal thus complementary to existing ones' synthetic scopes will open wider avenues to prepare biomolecule conjugates. \n\nOrthodox bioconjugation methods are rooted in the nucleophilicity of substituents on amino acids and therefore, the functionalisation of non-nucleophilic amino acids, such as valine, leucine, or phenylalanine, remains a challenge. An extension of metal-free, rapid and aqueous synthetic methodologies in C-H activation will provide a wider pool of potential designs for antibody conjugation linkers. \n\nWhile many reactions are reported for native amino acid functionalisation to produce antibody or protein-payload conjugate, only few has succeeded to do it in nearly 100% aqueous medium, within a short enough duration, without any potentially denaturing agents. Last but not least, atom-economy is highly important for the antibody conjugation efficiency. While disul\ue103de rebridging linker is emerging as a promising approach to control Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR), a recent preclinical study suggests that a strict control of DAR may not be the most critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy. 58 It seems that more thorough and detailed studies on different combinations of antibody, drug, linker's chemistry and conjugation site are required in order to better understand ADC's therapeutic pro\ue103le. We envisage that antibody-payload conjugates will expand their indications beyond cancer, with the development of good linkers.",

Breast tumor heterogeneity is a major factor contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis after chemotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging chemotherapeutic agents with striking clinical success, including T-DM1 for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Here, we show that homogeneous ADCs containing two distinct payloads are a promising drug class for addressing this clinical challenge. Our conjugates show HER2-specific cell killing potency, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, minimal inflammatory response, and marginal toxicity at therapeutic doses. Notably, a dual-drug ADC exerts greater treatment effect and survival benefit than does co-administration of two single-drug variants in xenograft mouse models representing intratumor HER2 heterogeneity and elevated drug resistance. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the dual-drug ADC format for treating refractory breast cancer and perhaps other cancers. Intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer can limit the clinical success of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly expanding class of biotherapeutics that utilize antibodies to selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor site. As of May 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ten ADCs, namely Adcetris\u00ae, Kadcyla\u00ae, Besponsa\u00ae, Mylotarg\u00ae, Polivy\u00ae, Padcev\u00ae, Enhertu\u00ae, Trodelvy\u00ae, Blenrep\u00ae, and Zynlonta\u2122 as monotherapy or combinational therapy for breast cancer, urothelial cancer, myeloma, acute leukemia, and lymphoma. In addition, over 80 investigational ADCs are currently being evaluated in approximately 150 active clinical trials. Despite the growing interest in ADCs, challenges remain to expand their therapeutic index (with greater efficacy and less toxicity). Recent advances in the manufacturing technology for the antibody, payload, and linker combined with new bioconjugation platforms and state-of-the-art analytical techniques are helping to shape the future development of ADCs. This review highlights the current status of marketed ADCs and those under clinical investigation with a focus on translational strategies to improve product quality, safety, and efficacy.",

                    "text": "The chemical linker is a critical component of the ADC that joins the mAb and the cytotoxic payload. The linker facilitates ADC stability in circulation until the ADC reaches the target cell and the payload is released. 143 There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. 144 Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. 145 This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

Twomey, Baolin Zhang\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly expanding class of biotherapeutics that utilize antibodies to selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor site. As of May 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ten ADCs, namely Adcetris\u00ae, Kadcyla\u00ae, Besponsa\u00ae, Mylotarg\u00ae, Polivy\u00ae, Padcev\u00ae, Enhertu\u00ae, Trodelvy\u00ae, Blenrep\u00ae, and Zynlonta\u2122 as monotherapy or combinational therapy for breast cancer, urothelial cancer, myeloma, acute leukemia, and lymphoma. In addition, over 80 investigational ADCs are currently being evaluated in approximately 150 active clinical trials. Despite the growing interest in ADCs, challenges remain to expand their therapeutic index (with greater efficacy and less toxicity). Recent advances in the manufacturing technology for the antibody, payload, and linker combined with new bioconjugation platforms and state-of-the-art analytical techniques are helping to shape the future development of ADCs. This review highlights the current status of marketed ADCs and those under clinical investigation with a focus on translational strategies to improve product quality, safety, and efficacy.\n## Linker chemistry and conjugation methods\nThe chemical linker is a critical component of the ADC that joins the mAb and the cytotoxic payload. The linker facilitates ADC stability in circulation until the ADC reaches the target cell and the payload is released. 143 There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. 144 Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. 145 This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

As the field matures, much attention has focused upon the key factors required to produce safe and efficacious ADCs. Recently the role that linker-payload reagent design has on the properties of ADCs has been highlighted as an important consideration for developers. We have investigated the effect of incorporating hydrophilic macrocycles into reagent structures on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of ADCs. Bis-sulfone based disulfide rebridging reagents bearing Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE linker-payloads were synthesized with a panel of cyclodextrins and crown ethers integrated into their structures via a glutamic acid branching point. Brentuximab was selected as a model antibody and ten ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 were prepared for biological evaluation. In vitro, the ADCs prepared showed broadly similar potency (range: 16\u201334 pM) and were comparable to Adcetris\u00ae (16 pM). In vivo, the cyclodextrin containing ADCs showed greater efficacy than Adcetris\u00ae and the most efficacious variant (incorporating a 3\u2032-amino-\u03b1-cyclodextrin component) matched a 24-unit poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing comparator. The ADCs bearing crown ethers also displayed enhanced in vivo efficacy compared to Adcetris\u00ae, the most active variant (containing a 1-aza-42-crown-14 macrocycle) was superior to an analogous ADC with a larger 24-unit PEG chain. In summary, we have demonstrated that hydrophilic macrocycles can be effectively incorporated into ADC reagent design and offer the potential for enhanced alternatives to established drug-linker architectures.",

As the number of ADCs entering the clinic and achieving regulatory approval continues to grow, there remains a concerted research effort to explore alternative drug-linker designs with the aim of enhancing ADC efficacy and safety. A wide array of structural options for the linker component connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic drug exist. Recent attention has focused on the use of site-specific conjugating linkers to improve ADC homogeneity and a variety of both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been employed to maximize toxin delivery to tumor cells (Frigerio and Kyle, 2017;Zhou, 2017;Dal Corso et al., 2019). \n\nRecent research has focused on the inclusion of polymeric portions within ADC linker structure to overcome some of the inherent issues surrounding ADC design such as hydrophobicity, aggregation, instability, insufficient drug-loading and reduced circulatory half-life. Typically, the polymers have been amphiphilic in nature, being water-soluble, synthetic and substantially non-antigenic with particular focus on polyalkylene oxides such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Since the first PEGylated protein was approved in 1990, PEG has become one of the most widely used polymers in biopharmaceutical applications with numerous products entering clinical trials and receiving marketing approval (Veronese and Mero, 2008;Turecek et al., 2016). PEG features within two of the currently approved ADCs, sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy \u00ae ) and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta \u00ae ), and its utility within ADC reagents has been widely investigated, mainly to improve reagent solubility and to reduce aggregation of the final ADC.",

Frigerio, Matthew Bird\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have begun to fulfil their promise as targeted cancer therapeutics with ten clinical approvals to date. As the field matures, much attention has focused upon the key factors required to produce safe and efficacious ADCs. Recently the role that linker-payload reagent design has on the properties of ADCs has been highlighted as an important consideration for developers. We have investigated the effect of incorporating hydrophilic macrocycles into reagent structures on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of ADCs. Bis-sulfone based disulfide rebridging reagents bearing Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE linker-payloads were synthesized with a panel of cyclodextrins and crown ethers integrated into their structures via a glutamic acid branching point. Brentuximab was selected as a model antibody and ten ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 were prepared for biological evaluation. In vitro, the ADCs prepared showed broadly similar potency (range: 16\u201334 pM) and were comparable to Adcetris\u00ae (16 pM). In vivo, the cyclodextrin containing ADCs showed greater efficacy than Adcetris\u00ae and the most efficacious variant (incorporating a 3\u2032-amino-\u03b1-cyclodextrin component) matched a 24-unit poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing comparator. The ADCs bearing crown ethers also displayed enhanced in vivo efficacy compared to Adcetris\u00ae, the most active variant (containing a 1-aza-42-crown-14 macrocycle) was superior to an analogous ADC with a larger 24-unit PEG chain. In summary, we have demonstrated that hydrophilic macrocycles can be effectively incorporated into ADC reagent design and offer the potential for enhanced alternatives to established drug-linker architectures.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe concept of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapeutics combines the unique targeting properties of a monoclonal antibody to deliver a high potency of a cytotoxin attached via an appropriate linker. As the number of ADCs entering the clinic and achieving regulatory approval continues to grow, there remains a concerted research effort to explore alternative drug-linker designs with the aim of enhancing ADC efficacy and safety. A wide array of structural options for the linker component connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic drug exist. Recent attention has focused on the use of site-specific conjugating linkers to improve ADC homogeneity and a variety of both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been employed to maximize toxin delivery to tumor cells (Frigerio and Kyle, 2017;Zhou, 2017;Dal Corso et al., 2019). \n\nRecent research has focused on the inclusion of polymeric portions within ADC linker structure to overcome some of the inherent issues surrounding ADC design such as hydrophobicity, aggregation, instability, insufficient drug-loading and reduced circulatory half-life. Typically, the polymers have been amphiphilic in nature, being water-soluble, synthetic and substantially non-antigenic with particular focus on polyalkylene oxides such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Since the first PEGylated protein was approved in 1990, PEG has become one of the most widely used polymers in biopharmaceutical applications with numerous products entering clinical trials and receiving marketing approval (Veronese and Mero, 2008;Turecek et al., 2016). PEG features within two of the currently approved ADCs, sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy \u00ae ) and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta \u00ae ), and its utility within ADC reagents has been widely investigated, mainly to improve reagent solubility and to reduce aggregation of the final ADC.",

In view of the recognized importance of targeted drug delivery strategies for cancer therapy, we discuss the advantages of alternative drug carriers and where these should be applied, focusing on peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs), particularly those discovered through combinatorial peptide libraries. By defining the advantages and disadvantages of naked TMAs, ADCs and PDCs it should be possible to develop a more rational approach to the application of targeted drug delivery strategies in different situations and ultimately, to a broader basket of more effective therapies for cancer patients.",

                    "text": "One area that has received much attention in ADC development is the chemistry of drug attachment. Factors important here include selection of a linker attachment site that retains antibody activity, linker length and composition and the design of drug analogs for attachment to the linker [51,53,54,82,90]. Two methods are commonly used for conjugating drugs to antibodies: alkylation of reduced interchain cysteine disulfides through an enzymatically non-cleavable maleimido or simple and cleavable disulfide linker (Figure 1a) and acylation of lysines by cleavable linear amino acids (Figure 1b). Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells [54], Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course There are 8 interchain cysteines and up to 100 lysines available for conjugation on IgG1 antibodies and conjugation to these sites results in heterogeneous mixtures. Cysteine conjugates provide a greater degree of uniformity than lysine-based conjugates [91,92] while recombinant methods in which cysteines are introduced into the antibody backbone at specific sites result in still more uniform conjugation [93,94]. In some instances, it has been observed that the location of the conjugated drug is not as important as the stoichiometry of drug attachment, although this is difficult to ensure [91,93]. ADCs with two to four drugs per antibody are generally superior to more heavily loaded conjugates that tend to be cleared very rapidly from the circulation [95].",

In view of the recognized importance of targeted drug delivery strategies for cancer therapy, we discuss the advantages of alternative drug carriers and where these should be applied, focusing on peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs), particularly those discovered through combinatorial peptide libraries. By defining the advantages and disadvantages of naked TMAs, ADCs and PDCs it should be possible to develop a more rational approach to the application of targeted drug delivery strategies in different situations and ultimately, to a broader basket of more effective therapies for cancer patients.\n## Attachment of linker-drug to antibody\nOne area that has received much attention in ADC development is the chemistry of drug attachment. Factors important here include selection of a linker attachment site that retains antibody activity, linker length and composition and the design of drug analogs for attachment to the linker [51,53,54,82,90]. Two methods are commonly used for conjugating drugs to antibodies: alkylation of reduced interchain cysteine disulfides through an enzymatically non-cleavable maleimido or simple and cleavable disulfide linker (Figure 1a) and acylation of lysines by cleavable linear amino acids (Figure 1b). Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells [54], Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course There are 8 interchain cysteines and up to 100 lysines available for conjugation on IgG1 antibodies and conjugation to these sites results in heterogeneous mixtures. Cysteine conjugates provide a greater degree of uniformity than lysine-based conjugates [91,92] while recombinant methods in which cysteines are introduced into the antibody backbone at specific sites result in still more uniform conjugation [93,94]. In some instances, it has been observed that the location of the conjugated drug is not as important as the stoichiometry of drug attachment, although this is difficult to ensure [91,93]. ADCs with two to four drugs per antibody are generally superior to more heavily loaded conjugates that tend to be cleared very rapidly from the circulation [95].",

Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development. From the selection of an appropriate antibody to the finished product, the entire process of the development of an ADC is a difficult and challenging task. Clinical pharmacology is one of the most important tools of drug development since this tool helps in finding the optimum dose of a product, thus preserving the safety and efficacy of the product in a patient population. Unlike other small or large molecules where only one moiety and/or metabolite(s) is generally measured for the pharmacokinetic profiling, there are several moieties that need to be measured for characterizing the PK profiles of an ADC. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of clinical pharmacology of ADCs is vital for the selection of a safe and efficacious dose in a patient population.",

Mahmood\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are biopharmaceutical products where a monoclonal antibody is linked to a biologically active drug (a small molecule) forming a conjugate. Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development. From the selection of an appropriate antibody to the finished product, the entire process of the development of an ADC is a difficult and challenging task. Clinical pharmacology is one of the most important tools of drug development since this tool helps in finding the optimum dose of a product, thus preserving the safety and efficacy of the product in a patient population. Unlike other small or large molecules where only one moiety and/or metabolite(s) is generally measured for the pharmacokinetic profiling, there are several moieties that need to be measured for characterizing the PK profiles of an ADC. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of clinical pharmacology of ADCs is vital for the selection of a safe and efficacious dose in a patient population.\n## Cleavable Linkers\nCleavable linkers play a critical part in the design of antibody-drug conjugates. They are safe in the blood circulation for an extensive period of time and effectively release their cytotoxic payload in the tumor microenvironment for removal of the tumor cells [43][44][45]. The most commonly used non-cleavable linkers in antibody-drug conjugates are succinimide-thioether bonds, which are formed by the reaction of maleimides with thiols [43]. \n\nSeveral other forms of linkers [46][47][48][49] such as chemically labile linkers (hydrazone and disulfide), acid-cleavable linkers (hydrazone), reducible linkers, peptide-based linkers, and \u03b2-Glucuronide linkers are also part of ADCs' linker conjugation.",

Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs.",

In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

Tomczuk\n## Abstract\nThe list of ADCs in the clinic continues to grow, bolstered by the success of first two marketed ADCs: ADCETRIS\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae. Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs.\n## CYSTEINE LINKERS\nOf the 40 ADCs that are in clinical trials, only 34 have disclosed the structures. The majority of these structures (24 out of 34) utilize attachment of the linker-drug directly to cysteine of the antibody. In fact, all of these take advantage of the excellent reactivity of maleimide with sulfhydryl groups. There are two common maleimide-type linkers: maleimidocaproyl (mc) and maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (abbreviated Bmcc^in this review) (Fig. 4). All of the auristatin-containing ADCs, both monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), utilize the Bmc^linkage to the antibody. One negative aspect of utilizing maleimide chemistry for cysteine linkage has been its chemical instability in plasma, including a retro-Michael reaction which results in premature loss of the drug-linker from the ADC. Senter et al. realized that hydrolysis of the thiosuccinimide ring prevented this elimination. Thus, this\n\n## LINKER-MAYTANSINOID MOTIFS\nIn one study, an ADC using a PEG 4 Mal linker with DM1 was markedly more effective in eradicating MDR-expressing xenograft tumors than the ADC with the MCC-DM1 linker (10). In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

Using the right kind of linker is very important in order to maintain the antibody-drug stability, and hence they are now being given more importance than earlier after showing failed performance in the previously performed clinical trials.

Manuscript Info Abstract ......................... ........................................................................ Manuscript History\n## Linkers:-\nThe linkers as the name suggests help linking the antibodies to the cytotoxic drugs or payloads. They play an instrumental role in the functioning of the ADCs and influencing their efficacy. Highly specific linkers are chemically prepared in order to make the ADCs functional, they are biodegradable and decide the release profile of the cytotoxic drug. Using the right kind of linker is very important in order to maintain the antibody-drug stability, and hence they are now being given more importance than earlier after showing failed performance in the previously performed clinical trials. The linkers are now chosen more critically and are thus being restricted to just a few choices namely hydrazones, peptides disulphides and thioethers. \n\nTable1:-Different chemical linkers. \n\nLinkers are further of two types cleavable and non-cleavable: \uf0b7 Non-Cleavable linkers follow ADC lysosomal degradation; in this case the cytotoxic payload is active even when it's attached to the linker and an amino acid residue. It helps in avoiding non-specific discharge of drugs and also facilitates in altering the chemical properties and hence affinity of small molecules. Eg. T-DM1 [41]. \n\n\uf0b7 Cleavable linker on the other hand involves the possibility of bystander effect. They function on low pH in lysosomes and hence are acid sensitive, so the linker is digested in the acidic environment inside the lysosome or endosome and the drug is delivered.

Treatments to mitigate cancer are usually so intense and invasive that they weaken the patient to cure as dangerous as the own disease. From some time ago until today, to reduce resistance generated by the constant administration of the drug and improve its pharmacokinetics, scientists have been developing drug delivery system (DDS) technology. DDS platforms aim to maximize the drugs\u2019 effectiveness by directing them to reach the affected area by the disease and, therefore, reduce the potential side effects. Erythrocytes, antibodies, and nanoparticles have been used as carriers. Eleven antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) involving covalent linkage has been commercialized as a promising cancer treatment in the last years. This review describes the general features and applications of DDS focused on the covalent conjugation system that binds the antibody carrier to the cytotoxic drug.",

The main idea is to generate bi or tri-functionalized linkers, in which orthogonal reactions allow the incorporation of different payloads using covalent bonds (Levengood et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2018;Zhang L. et al., 2021;Yamazaki et al., 2021). Levengood et al. (2017) prepared a linker with sequential Cys residues with orthogonal protection to enable site-specific conjugation of each drug and conjugated to IgG1 through the reduced interchain disulfides of the antibody and stable maleimide linkage.

Vispo, F. Albericio, H. Rodr\u00edguez\n## Abstract\nCancer is one of the diseases with the highest mortality rate. Treatments to mitigate cancer are usually so intense and invasive that they weaken the patient to cure as dangerous as the own disease. From some time ago until today, to reduce resistance generated by the constant administration of the drug and improve its pharmacokinetics, scientists have been developing drug delivery system (DDS) technology. DDS platforms aim to maximize the drugs\u2019 effectiveness by directing them to reach the affected area by the disease and, therefore, reduce the potential side effects. Erythrocytes, antibodies, and nanoparticles have been used as carriers. Eleven antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) involving covalent linkage has been commercialized as a promising cancer treatment in the last years. This review describes the general features and applications of DDS focused on the covalent conjugation system that binds the antibody carrier to the cytotoxic drug.\n## Chemical Conjugation\nThe other achievement of this study is generated homogeneous ADC's (Nanna et al., 2017). \n\nValine-citrulline dipeptide has been used as a linker for ADCs such as DLYE5953A, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the lymphocyte antigen 6 complex (LY6E) conjugated to Monomethylauristatin (MMAE) under the auspices of Genentech and showed antitumor activity in patients with solid metastatic tumors (Tolaney et al., 2021). \n\nIn the last years, various reports related to multiloading linkers have proposed a novel methodology incorporating two payload molecules into single monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The main idea is to generate bi or tri-functionalized linkers, in which orthogonal reactions allow the incorporation of different payloads using covalent bonds (Levengood et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2018;Zhang L. et al., 2021;Yamazaki et al., 2021). Levengood et al. (2017) prepared a linker with sequential Cys residues with orthogonal protection to enable site-specific conjugation of each drug and conjugated to IgG1 through the reduced interchain disulfides of the antibody and stable maleimide linkage. In 2018, a novel heterotrifunctional linker was developed by Kumar et al. (2018), providing a flexible platform that allows the coupling of two different drugs via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and via oxime linkage using ketone as starting functional group, but also the conjugation to the antibody through cysteine-maleimide reaction.",

Kalim, Jie Chen, Shenghao Wang, Caiyao Lin, Saif Ullah, Keying Liang, Qian Ding, Shuqing Chen, Jinbiao Zhan\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) is a milestone in targeted cancer therapy that comprises of monoclonal antibodies chemically linked to cytotoxic drugs. Internalization of ADC takes place via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and pinocytosis. Conjugation strategies, endocytosis and intracellular trafficking optimization, linkers, and drugs chemistry present a great challenge for researchers to eradicate tumor cells successfully. This inventiveness of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking has given considerable momentum recently to develop specific antibodies and ADCs to treat cancer cells. It is significantly advantageous to emphasize the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways efficiently and to design potent engineered conjugates and biological entities to boost efficient therapies enormously for cancer treatment. Current studies illustrate endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of ADC, protein, and linker strategies in unloading and also concisely evaluate practically applicable ADCs.\n## Linker strategy and drug release\nLyon et al 71 introduce a novel concept of maleimide linkers that catalyze their own thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis, prevent drug loss, and develop a high stable ADC. King et al also reported a novel series of branched hydrazone linkers and made immune conjugates of mAbs BR96 and doxorubicin that were stable at pH 7. These conjugates release DOX molecules at lysosomal pH. They concluded a possible outcome of using a reduced amount of mAb load via branched methodology to acquire desired cytotoxic activity. 72 Recently, specificity of HER2 antibodies and enhanced activity of doxorubicin-labeled liposomes against cancer were also reported by our research group. 73 owever, poor circulation stability of hydrazine linker was also recorded as in the case of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), resulting in low clinical efficacy and safety. 74 n the other hand, premature release in circulation is being prevented by utilizing non-cleavable linkers. 56 Noncleavable linkers result in enzymatic degradation of ADC in lysosome and accurate release of drug with their conjugated amino acid lysine or cysteine. 67 Active research by chemists to develop new linkers and discover novel potent effector molecules that suit ADC is currently being investigated.",

            "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have recently been proven to be highly potent anti-tumor drugs, typically exceeding the efficacy of conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). ADCs are currently produced by chemical conjugation of a small-molecule toxin to the mAb through lysine or cysteine side chains. This leads to heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs in which variable numbers of drugs are conjugated to individual antibodies and in which the site of conjugation cannot be defined. Consequently, there is currently significant interest in further development of drug conjugation technologies, with a particular focus on site-specific payload conjugation. Here, we present an enzymatic conjugation platform based on the S. aureus sortase A-mediated transpeptidation reaction, allowing the efficient generation of ADCs with toxins conjugated to pre-defined sites at pre-defined drug-to-antibody ratios. For this, two modifications were introduced: first, immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains were modified at their C-termini by addition of the sortase A recognition motif LPETG, and second, the small molecule tubulin polymerization inhibitors monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and maytansine were modified by addition of a pentaglycine peptide, thus making them suitable substrates for sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. We demonstrate efficient generation and characterization of the anti-CD30 ADC Ac10-vcPAB-MMAE, an enzymatically conjugated counterpart of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), as well as several anti-HER-2 ADCs including trastuzumab-maytansine, the counterpart of trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla). ADCs generated in this manner were found to display in vitro cell killing activities indistinguishable from the classic conjugates. Further, when tested in vivo in a HER-2-overexpressing ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model, enzymatically generated trastuzumab-maytansine was found to lead to complete regression of established tumors, similar to Kadcyla.",

Beerli, T. Hell, Anna S. Merkel, U. Grawunder\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have recently been proven to be highly potent anti-tumor drugs, typically exceeding the efficacy of conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). ADCs are currently produced by chemical conjugation of a small-molecule toxin to the mAb through lysine or cysteine side chains. This leads to heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs in which variable numbers of drugs are conjugated to individual antibodies and in which the site of conjugation cannot be defined. Consequently, there is currently significant interest in further development of drug conjugation technologies, with a particular focus on site-specific payload conjugation. Here, we present an enzymatic conjugation platform based on the S. aureus sortase A-mediated transpeptidation reaction, allowing the efficient generation of ADCs with toxins conjugated to pre-defined sites at pre-defined drug-to-antibody ratios. For this, two modifications were introduced: first, immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains were modified at their C-termini by addition of the sortase A recognition motif LPETG, and second, the small molecule tubulin polymerization inhibitors monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and maytansine were modified by addition of a pentaglycine peptide, thus making them suitable substrates for sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. We demonstrate efficient generation and characterization of the anti-CD30 ADC Ac10-vcPAB-MMAE, an enzymatically conjugated counterpart of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), as well as several anti-HER-2 ADCs including trastuzumab-maytansine, the counterpart of trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla). ADCs generated in this manner were found to display in vitro cell killing activities indistinguishable from the classic conjugates. Further, when tested in vivo in a HER-2-overexpressing ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model, enzymatically generated trastuzumab-maytansine was found to lead to complete regression of established tumors, similar to Kadcyla.\n## Introduction\nAll ADCs currently applied in the clinic, or in clinical trials, have been manufactured using chemical conjugation involving linkers that covalently attach the toxic payload to either primary amino groups of lysine residues in the antibody structure, or to free thiol groups that are usually generated by mild reduction of intra-chain disulphide bridges of the antibody [14,15].

Currently, there are 12 FDA-approved ADCs, eight of which have been approved within the last five years, with numerous candidates in clinical trials. The promising clinical perspective of ADCs has led to the development of not only novel conjugation techniques, but also antibody formats, linkers, and payloads. While the majority of currently approved ADCs relies on cytotoxic small molecule warheads, alternative modes of action imparted by novel payloads and non-classical antibody formats are gaining attention. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art of ADC technologies, as well as comprehensively examine alternative payloads, such as toxic proteins, cytokines, PROTACs and oligonucleotides, and highlight the potential of multi-specific antibody formats for the next generation of therapeutic antibody conjugates.",

Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

Stengl\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are rapidly becoming a cornerstone in targeted therapies, especially for the treatment of cancer. Currently, there are 12 FDA-approved ADCs, eight of which have been approved within the last five years, with numerous candidates in clinical trials. The promising clinical perspective of ADCs has led to the development of not only novel conjugation techniques, but also antibody formats, linkers, and payloads. While the majority of currently approved ADCs relies on cytotoxic small molecule warheads, alternative modes of action imparted by novel payloads and non-classical antibody formats are gaining attention. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art of ADC technologies, as well as comprehensively examine alternative payloads, such as toxic proteins, cytokines, PROTACs and oligonucleotides, and highlight the potential of multi-specific antibody formats for the next generation of therapeutic antibody conjugates.\n## Linking up: Advances in Site-Directed Conjugation and Linker Design\nNotably, the TTL has a broad substrate tolerance and thus allows the incorporation of a variety of bioorthogonal handles [111] for subsequent site-specific toxin-conjugation. \n\nApart from these well-established methods several more site-specific conjugation concepts, like pi-clamp [112] or CD38 domain-tag [113], and conjugation to native lysines by using affinity peptides, e.g., as guides [114,115] have been published in the context of ADC generation and are comprehensively covered elsewhere [60,116]. Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

Drug dose escalation to therapeutically active levels is often impossible with chemotherapeutic drugs due to this toxicity. The selectivity of the treatment was improved with the introduction of monoclonal antibody drugs that are directed against targets that are selectively expressed in tumor cells [1-5]. Because antibodies bind specifically to their cognate antigen on the surface of cells, they can also be used as vehicles to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to the cancer cells. The class of therapeutic drug products where monoclonal antibody is conjugated with cytotoxic drug (pay load) are called Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) [6]. ADCs are powerful cancer therapeutics which provides high selectivity and efficacy towards cancer cells, and reduced toxicity to healthy cells [6,7].",

Drug dose escalation to therapeutically active levels is often impossible with chemotherapeutic drugs due to this toxicity. The selectivity of the treatment was improved with the introduction of monoclonal antibody drugs that are directed against targets that are selectively expressed in tumor cells [1-5]. Because antibodies bind specifically to their cognate antigen on the surface of cells, they can also be used as vehicles to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to the cancer cells. The class of therapeutic drug products where monoclonal antibody is conjugated with cytotoxic drug (pay load) are called Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) [6]. ADCs are powerful cancer therapeutics which provides high selectivity and efficacy towards cancer cells, and reduced toxicity to healthy cells [6,7].\n## Conjugation of MAb to payload via Linkers\nA variety of Linkers can connect MAb to the drug of our choice. Linker conjugation mechanism influences stability of ADCs and drug antibody ratio (DAR) of the ADC therapeutics. In general, linkers used in ADCs should be stable and avoid prerelease of the payload during circulation in the blood. At the same time linkers should be amenable to release the payload after internalization into tumor cells [13]. The number of drug molecules bound to antibody (DAR) and their position would greatly influence the ADCs binding affinity to antigen, aggregation, efficacy, and even safety [14]. \n\nThe most commonly used linkers conjugate the drug to antibody via a covalent bond with either thiol group of cysteines or eplison amine group of lysine on antibody. The presence of four inter-chain disulphide bridges in IgG antibody provides eight maximum possible conjugation sites [15]. Therefore, a drug conjugated via cysteine can have a DAR (No of drug molecules/antibody as measured by chromatography and mass spectrometry) up to 8 depending on the number of cysteine sites conjugated with payload [16][17][18]. In contrast to cysteine conjugation site, conjugation at lysine would generate highly heterogenous mixtures of ADCs with variable DAR ratio since antibodies have up to 30 lysine amino acids available for conjugation.

The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a.

The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].",

It relies on periodate oxidation of naturally present glycans of immunoglobulin G, followed by oxime ligation and, optionally, copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition for conjugation with a toxic payload. The introduction of highly absorbing cyanine dyes into the linker allows for facile determination of the drug\u2013antibody ratio. We applied this methodology to the synthesis of cytotoxic conjugates of an antibody against the tumor-associated antigen PRAME with doxorubicin and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resultant conjugates retained their affinity to a large extent, yet their cytotoxicity in vitro varied dramatically: while the doxorubicin-based conjugate did not produce any effect on cells, the MMAE-based one demonstrated specific activity against PRAME-expressing cancer cell lines. Importantly, the latter conjugate constitutes the first reported example of a PRAME-targeting ADC.",

                    "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of antibodies with the potency of small molecules. Despite the simplicity of the concept, designing clinically successful ADCs is rather challenging: after 50 years of research and development there are currently about a dozen approved ADC medicines, and over one hundred are in clinical trials [1,2]. The linker connecting the antibody with the toxic payload is pivotal for the stability of the ADC in systemic circulation and key to the efficient and selective release of the payload at the tumor site [3][4][5][6]. The methodology of antibody modification and ADC linker chemistry is a vast subject crucial for ADC development [7][8][9][10]. \n\nOur goal was to develop linkers and a methodology suitable for site-specific modification of standard monoclonal IgG antibodies without the need for engineered glycans or amino acids. Acylation of \u03b5-amino side chains of lysine leads to nonspecific modification, occasionally affecting antigen-binding domains [11]. Controlled reduction of cysteine followed by reaction with maleimide or disulfide rebridging reagents is a common technique for ADC assembly [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This approach can be considered site-selective because interchain disulfides are more susceptible to reduction than intra-chain ones, and their number is well-known and strictly defined for each IgG subtype. In addition, they are located far from the antigen-binding site. However, this approach requires careful optimization to prevent the loss of integrity of IgG [11,19]. In addition to these classic well-known methods, there is also a whole class of new methods that allow for the introduction of functional groups into IgG with exceptional precision, but which require manipulation of its structure through genetic engineering. Such methods include genetically engineered introduction of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) [20] with biorthogonal functional groups [21], as well as the introduction of various peptide tags for subsequent selective enzymatic ligation [4,[22][23][24]. These methods are complicated and do not allow using an \"off the shelf\" antibody.",

Lyzhko, A. Barmashov, A. Misyurin, A. Ustinov, V. Alferova, V. Korshun\n## Abstract\nA universal approach to the construction of antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) has been developed. It relies on periodate oxidation of naturally present glycans of immunoglobulin G, followed by oxime ligation and, optionally, copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition for conjugation with a toxic payload. The introduction of highly absorbing cyanine dyes into the linker allows for facile determination of the drug\u2013antibody ratio. We applied this methodology to the synthesis of cytotoxic conjugates of an antibody against the tumor-associated antigen PRAME with doxorubicin and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resultant conjugates retained their affinity to a large extent, yet their cytotoxicity in vitro varied dramatically: while the doxorubicin-based conjugate did not produce any effect on cells, the MMAE-based one demonstrated specific activity against PRAME-expressing cancer cell lines. Importantly, the latter conjugate constitutes the first reported example of a PRAME-targeting ADC.\n## Introduction\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of antibodies with the potency of small molecules. Despite the simplicity of the concept, designing clinically successful ADCs is rather challenging: after 50 years of research and development there are currently about a dozen approved ADC medicines, and over one hundred are in clinical trials [1,2]. The linker connecting the antibody with the toxic payload is pivotal for the stability of the ADC in systemic circulation and key to the efficient and selective release of the payload at the tumor site [3][4][5][6]. The methodology of antibody modification and ADC linker chemistry is a vast subject crucial for ADC development [7][8][9][10]. \n\nOur goal was to develop linkers and a methodology suitable for site-specific modification of standard monoclonal IgG antibodies without the need for engineered glycans or amino acids. Acylation of \u03b5-amino side chains of lysine leads to nonspecific modification, occasionally affecting antigen-binding domains [11]. Controlled reduction of cysteine followed by reaction with maleimide or disulfide rebridging reagents is a common technique for ADC assembly [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This approach can be considered site-selective because interchain disulfides are more susceptible to reduction than intra-chain ones, and their number is well-known and strictly defined for each IgG subtype. In addition, they are located far from the antigen-binding site. However, this approach requires careful optimization to prevent the loss of integrity of IgG [11,19]. In addition to these classic well-known methods, there is also a whole class of new methods that allow for the introduction of functional groups into IgG with exceptional precision, but which require manipulation of its structure through genetic engineering. Such methods include genetically engineered introduction of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) [20] with biorthogonal functional groups [21], as well as the introduction of various peptide tags for subsequent selective enzymatic ligation [4,[22][23][24]. These methods are complicated and do not allow using an \"off the shelf\" antibody.",

While selection of the appropriate antibody (A) and drug payload (D) is dictated by the pharmacology of the targeted disease, one has a broader choice of the conjugating linker (C).

            "text": "One area that has received much attention in ADC development is the chemistry of drug attachment. Factors important here include selection of a linker attachment site that retains antibody activity, linker length and composition and the design of drug analogs for attachment to the linker [51,53,54,82,90]. Two methods are commonly used for conjugating drugs to antibodies: alkylation of reduced interchain cysteine disulfides through an enzymatically non-cleavable maleimido or simple and cleavable disulfide linker (Figure 1a) and acylation of lysines by cleavable linear amino acids (Figure 1b). Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells [54], Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course There are 8 interchain cysteines and up to 100 lysines available for conjugation on IgG1 antibodies and conjugation to these sites results in heterogeneous mixtures. Cysteine conjugates provide a greater degree of uniformity than lysine-based conjugates [91,92] while recombinant methods in which cysteines are introduced into the antibody backbone at specific sites result in still more uniform conjugation [93,94]. In some instances, it has been observed that the location of the conjugated drug is not as important as the stoichiometry of drug attachment, although this is difficult to ensure [91,93]. ADCs with two to four drugs per antibody are generally superior to more heavily loaded conjugates that tend to be cleared very rapidly from the circulation [95].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are therapeutic modalities composed of a target-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) connected via a chemical linker to a small molecule drug (payload) that has cell-killing (cytotoxic) activity. 1 The production of these therapeutic modalities relies on the chemical conjugation of a linker-payload (LP) to a specific natural or unnatural amino acid on the antibody. 2 Depending on the conjugation chemistry and site of LP attachment, the molecular structure of the ADC could be very complex and heterogeneous. 3 urthermore, the linker chemistry can be \"cleavable\" or \"noncleavable\". ADCs with cleavable linkers rely on protease cleavage, 4 acid hydrolysis 5 or other mechanisms to release the unmodified payload as active species, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers 6 rely on the degradation of antibody to release the active species. Both the cleavability as well as the sites of conjugation have a substantial effect on the analytical strategy for ADC characterization. \n\nConventional conjugation chemistries typically involve cysteine or lysine residues. Cysteine conjugation is well established, [7][8] and usually the hinge-region cysteines that are used for the formation of interchain disulfide bonds are targeted for conjugation. There are four interchain disulfide bonds in the IgG1 molecule and, after partial reduction, conjugation can occur randomly at any of these cysteine residue pairs ranging from zero LP additions to a maximum drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Typically, these hinge-region cysteine-conjugated ADCs have an even-number distribution of LP moieties with an average DAR of approximately 4. Even with missing interchain disulfide bonds, the molecule is held together by noncovalent bonds.",

Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints.

Their clinical success has been demonstrated by the 4 ADCs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 60 promising ADCs now in clinical trials. Further advancement of this novel molecular platform could potentially revolutionize current strategies and regimens for treating cancers. The linker structure and antibody-linker conjugation modality critically contribute to ADC homogeneity, circulation stability, pharmacokinetic profiles, tolerability, and overall treatment efficacy. Despite extensive efforts to improve these parameters, most ADC linkers used to date possess linear structures, and therefore accommodate only single payloads. The clinical potential of branched ADC linkers, enabling the installation of two payload molecules, remains unexplored because of the lack of efficient conjugation methods. In addition, according to a recent report, the stability of enzymatically cleavable linkers in mouse circulation is another crucial factor for the successful evaluation of ADCs in preclinical studies. In this review, I present my research group's effort to develop both branched linkers and efficient conjugation methods for constructing dual-loading ADCs with high homogeneity and enhanced potency. I also present a novel tripeptide ADC linker with enhanced stability in mouse circulation.

            "text": "The chemical conjugation of the antibody and the cytotoxic payload has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and the therapeutic index of ADC-based therapies [12]. A linker is the required covalent connection between the cytotoxic compound and the antibody. The linker influences the stability and drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of the therapeutic agent. These parameters are critical for the overall success of an ADC-based design. With the high potency of the payloads chosen, linkers must be stable within the bloodstream to limit early payload release and allow tumour site targeting to occur. However, this stability must be context-dependent: once inside the cell, these linkers must be efficient in releasing the payload to induced the cytotoxic effect [13].\n\nConventional ADC conjugation involves methods of alkylation of reduced interchain disulphides and alkylation or acylation of lysine residues [9]. These conjugation methods generate heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs with variable drug per antibody ratios (DARs). This varies between zero and eight conjugated payloads per antibody [14]. T-DM1, for example, has on average a DAR of 3.5 [15]. The position and number of payloads bound to the antibody can have profound effects on the binding to the antigen, the aggregation of the ADC, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the antibody construct, and even the safety profile of the ADC [16].\n\nImproving the antibody site for linker conjugation has been greatly enhanced through advancements in protein engineering. Antibody site-specific alterations enhance linker conjugation and result in homogeneous ADCs. These alterations can be mediated through enzymatic conjugation or insertion of reactive cysteine or chemoselective functional groups of unnatural amino acid residues into the antibody protein sequence [17]. The covalent connection between drug and antibody has been traditionally mediated through the thiol group of cysteine or the epsilon amino group of lysine residues [18].\n\nThe majority of ADCs in clinical trials attach the linker to a cysteine of the antibody. Cysteines are present within the intra and inter",

            "text": "The third component in modern ADC synthesis is the conjugation process itself. This has been improved in terms of linker/spacer moiety, conjugation specific site, and stoichiometry. The conjugation process should theoretically maintain the mAb and drug components in their native forms, and the product must remain intact during storage in aqueous solution or during the lyophilization/sterilization process, to allow convenient formulations. Furthermore, from the pharmaceutical development standpoint, the conjugation process must produce homogeneous batches and must be scalable, in order to satisfy the regulatory authorities. Several types of cleavable linkers have been evaluated, and the related approaches and evolution will be addressed below. \n\nRegarding the mAb component, there are three common reactions for conjugation: alkylation of reduced interchain disulfides, acylation of lysines, and alkylation of genetically-engineered cysteines. Because up to 100 lysines are available for acylation on one IgG1, conjugation to these sites results in heterogeneous mixtures. Eight interchain cysteines are available, and thus conjugates with a greater degree of uniformity than those based on lysine [92] can be obtained, while recombinant methods, in which cysteines are specifically introduced into the mAb backbone, provide even more uniform conjugates. \n\nIn some instances, it has been observed that the location of the conjugated drug is not as important as the stoichiometry of drug attachment [92,93]. ADCs with two to four drugs per antibody are generally superior to more heavily loaded conjugates, which clear very rapidly from the circulation [94]. In any case, using -random\u2016 chemical derivatization methods, it has proven difficult to prepare ADCs with only 2 drugs/mAb, because a large fraction of the mAb will not be conjugated to any drug. \n\nThe strategy concerning the toxic moiety and its ability to maintain high activity after derivatization requires an in-depth understanding of the organic-chemistry aspects of the process. Before illustrating the different synthetic approaches, it is necessary to have a clear view of the principal classes of toxic moiety.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugation has gained significant momentum during the past few years with more than ten antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) being approved by regulatory agencies for cancer treatment in clinics [1][2][3][4][5]. As hybrid molecules containing biologics and highly toxic low-molecular weight chemotherapeutic drugs, ADCs leverage the advantages of both targeting specificity of antibodies and high potency of cytotoxic compounds or synthetic cytotoxins. To synthesize ADCs, the antibodies are coupled with drug-linkers using different conjugation chemistries. The therapeutic index of the ADCs depends on many attributes including the expression profiles of selected cancer antigens, the qualities and specificities of antibodies, the properties of the synthetic cytotoxins (potency, mechanism of action, loading, cleavable or non-cleavable linkers), and the conjugation chemistries used [6]. The conventional conjugation approaches rely on non-specific/stochastic coupling of drug-linkers to lysines (about 40 residues per IgG1) or hinge cysteines (8 residues per IgG1). They often result in a heterogeneous profile of ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2 or 4, leading to difficulties in characterization and process control. To overcome these disadvantages, next generation site-specific antibody-drug conjugation methods have been developed. These methods have been reviewed in many excellent publications [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. \n\nIn addition to using synthetic cytotoxins, there is increased interest in coupling other payloads with site-specific antibody conjugation. These payloads include non-cytotoxic compounds that are not cytotoxic to human cells, as well as proteins/peptides, glycans, lipids, and nucleic acids. The review herein highlights the progress in site-specific conjugation of these payloads other than synthetic cytotoxins to antibody molecules after presenting a brief overview of advances in developing next generation antibody conjugation methods.",

Figure 4a shows the structures of two different linker-drugs, compound 4 has a linear linker and a maytansinoid payload, to make DAR2 ADCs, while compound 5 with a branched linker and MMAE payload, to make DAR4 ADCs. Figure 4b is a plot aggregation against time of ADCs based on antibodies trastuzumab or brentuximab and with linker-drugs4 or 5, in each case showing a pronounced enhanced aggregation profile in case azidosugar GalNAz is used versus use of azidosugar 6-azidoGalNAc. \n\nanionic surfactants (37.5 mM sodium decanoate or 11 mM sodium deoxycholate) or zwitterionic surfactant CHAPS (12 mM) with only 10% DMF co-solvent, using branched linker-drug 5 (for DAR4 ADC) at minimal stoichiometry (2-3 equiv.), and DARs were determined (Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure S24). A clear beneficial impact of anionic surfactants, but not CHAPS, was noted versus control (no additive), enhancing the DAR from <3 to close to 3.6 with only 2 equivalents of 5. Upon increase of linker-drug stoichiometry to 3 equivalents, DAR further improved to >3.6 in particular for sodium deoxycholate. The optimal conditions (10% DMF, 11 mM sodium deoxycholate) seamlessly translated to other payloads such as calicheamicin-based linker-drug 14 (Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure S25-26) to consistently provide the desired ADCs with high yield and DAR. Finally, we were keen to evaluate the in vivo potential of GlycoConnect\u2122/HydraSpace\u2122 ADCs in comparison to a marketed ADC.",

Despite the simplicity of this concept, generation of clinically successful ADCs has been very difficult. Over the past several decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the constraints on antibodies, linkers, and drugs as they relate to successful construction of ADCs. Once these components are in hand, most ADCs are prepared by nonspecific modification of antibody lysine or cysteine residues with drug-linker reagents, which results in heterogeneous product mixtures that cannot be further purified. With advances in the fields of bioorthogonal chemistry and protein engineering, there is growing interest in producing ADCs by site-specific conjugation to the antibody, yielding more homogeneous products that have demonstrated benefits over their heterogeneous counterparts in vivo. Here, we chronicle the development of a multitude of site-specific conjugation strategies for assembly of ADCs and provide a comprehensive account of key advances and their roots in the fields of bioorthogonal chemistry and protein engineering.",

            "text": "The chemical linker that connects the antibody to the cytotoxic payload plays a crucial role in ADC design. Various factors, such as the chemistry of the linker, the conjugation strategy, and the site of conjugation, critically influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the ADC. Several approaches can be used for coupling the linker to the antibody, including site-directed linkage to specific amino acids-which is the most commonly used in clinical practice and approved ADCs-and random conjugation to lysine or cysteine residues. Lysine linkage is based on the coupling of an amine from the mAb and an activated carboxylic acid of the payload, while the cysteine-based coupling of mAb reacts cysteine residues with a thiol-reactive functional group in the payload. These two methods generate random conjugates with different DAR and low homogeneity, since the payloads can couple on numerous residues along the mAb. However, other approaches exist to incorporate non-natural amino acids through genetic engineering into the antibody peptidic sequence with specific residual groups that favor site-directed conjugation [32,33]. The coupling of the payload to the mAb can also be generated by enzymatic strategies leading to tightly controlled DARs, as they show high site-specificity. The main enzymemediated strategies are transpeptidation using sortase A, microbial transglutaminase or N-Glycan engineering [34][35][36]. Protein conjugates, particularly in the production of bispecific antibodies, represent a rapidly advancing field of interest, with evolving technologies poised to advance conjugation techniques. This advancement enables the creation of sitespecific ADCs without necessitating extensive antibody engineering. Recent applications have demonstrated the successful generation of potent bispecific antibodies, underscoring the versatility of chemical methods and their potential in advancing targeted therapeutic development. Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are Trojan horses of medicinal chemistry: they are a targeted approach to treat cancer allowing selective delivery of effector molecules (payloads), such as cytotoxic or immune-modulating therapeutics, to malignant cells, thereby sparing healthy cells. The advancements in the ADC field and the role of organic chemistry in ADC development were recently highlighted in a review. [1] 2a] ADCs are utmost complex to develop [2b-d] and comprise three components: a disease-selective monoclonal antibody (mAb), a smallmolecule therapeutic payload (drug), and a linker which connects the two parts. 3a-c] To attach a drug-linker moiety to a mAb, a bioconjugation procedure is applied. Generally, the conjugation step is key for every ADC technology, since it not only dictates the nature and characteristics of the bioconjugate, but also the efficiency of the conjugation, that is, the percentage of the offered drug-linker moiety that is effectively coupled to the antibody. An efficient conjugation reaction will strongly contribute to the ultimate success of any ADC. \n\nTypical conjugation approaches are the stochastic (random) conjugation to lysine (Lys) residues and the conjugation to reduced cysteine (Cys) residues in the hinge region of the mAb, along with a variety of more recently developed techniques. [4] 5a] However, even modern site-specific conjugation procedures using, for example, genetically engineered amino acids or enzymatic approaches [6] mainly focus on the efficacy of the resulting ADCs or improvement of their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. Surprisingly, little attention is paid to the overall conjugation efficiency and manufacturability of the developed procedures. Therefore, desired conversions are typically achieved by addition of a large excess of a druglinker reagent, just to ensure a complete conjugation.",

Drugs and linkers have been the current focus of ADC development, in addition to antibody and target selection. Recently, however, the importance of conjugate homogeneity has been realized. The current methods for drug attachment lead to a heterogeneous mixture, and some populations of that mixture have poor in vivo performance. New methods for site-specific drug attachment lead to more homogeneous conjugates and allow control of the site of drug attachment. These subtle improvements can have profound effects on in vivo efficacy and therapeutic index. This review examines current methods for site-specific drug conjugation to antibodies, and compares in vivo results with their non-specifically conjugated counterparts. The apparent improvement in pharmacokinetics and the reduced off target toxicity warrant further development of this site-specific modification approach for future ADC development.",

            "text": "The simplified picture presented in Figure 1b might lead to the false understanding that taking an antibody and a toxic payload connected through some simple linker would give a drug. The facts that the first ADC (Mylotarg) was approved in 2000 (and following withdrawal in 2010 reapproved in 2017) and that the second ADC (Adcetris) received accelerated approval in 2011 and full approval in 2015 (Table 1) suggest otherwise. The third (Kadcyla) and fourth (Besponsa) ADCs were approved in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The slow start is proof of a long and complex learning phase, but the sustained efforts of the pharmaceutical industry seem to bear fruit. Since 2019, the number of approved ADCs more than doubled with five approvals in 2019-2020, signifying a better understanding of both the biology and chemistry of ADCs. Although in the present review we focus on conjugates bearing small molecules, it is important to note that conjugates with peptide toxins are also of therapeutic value exemplified by the approved drugs listed at the end of Table 1. \n\nThere are several changing parts in an ADC and apparently there is no generic formula to succeed. Thus, questions remain concerning: how to select the right antibody, where and how to attach the linker to the antibody, what kind of chemical linker to use to connect the antibody to the drug payload, how many drug molecules to attach per antibody, how to connect the linker and the drug payload, and what is the optimal drug payload like? Presuming that the biological background is robust, if we want to succeed in ADC development, we need to get the answer to all the above questions right, resulting in a unique combination of A-antibody, D-drug payload, and C-linker. In the following chapters, we review some of the key challenges and recent learnings focusing on the diverse aspects of ADC development where chemistry plays an important role.",

Approach A involves a reaction of the oxidized antibody 1 with conjugate 2 comprised of the linker dye oxyamine and Val-Cit-PABC-doxorubicin. Unfortunately, this approach proved incompatible with drug loads containing a carbonyl group, such as doxorubicin. To overcome this limitation, we developed approach B consisting of oxime ligation between oxyamine-azide dyecontaining linker 4 and oxidized antibody 1 followed by a copper-catalyzed click reaction with reagent 6. However, reagent 6 was not soluble enough in aqueous buffers, which made it unsuitable for conjugation. In approach C, payload solubility was markedly improved by the incorporation of a hydrophilic dye into azide linker 10. The oxidized antibody 1 was modified with alkyne linker 8, which was followed by CuAAC with 10. In approach D, for better stoichiometry control at the first step, we decided to introduce an additional fluorescent dye (sCy5) into alkyne linker 12. Oxime ligation with oxidized antibody 1 and subsequent CuAAC with 10 yielded the desired conjugate. Thus, we were able to control the stoichiometry of the assembly of the ADC with oxime ligation and CuAAC at every step. Finally, we used approach A to synthesize a more toxic 6H8-MMAE conjugate, 32.

As an indication of great success, 9 ADCs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and nearly 100 are in clinical trials 118 . \n\nThe ADC molecules work by relying on binding-initiated internalization and subsequent release of the cargo molecule 117 . As such, there are certain features required for the linker/ conjugation chemistry. If the conjugation is too labile, then the attached drug may release prematurely. If it is too stable, then it presents a challenge to the timely release at the desired location. Further, the conjugation chemistry needs to be compatible with the often-fragile nature of antibodies. Traditionally, the most commonly used method is tethering through a lysine amino or a cysteine sulfhydryl group of the antibody. However, the chemistry needed for such modifications often results in heterogeneous products and instability that affect the therapeutic efficacy of ADCs 119 . The synthesis of ADCs requires special chemical ligation tools so that the functional characteristics of both elements are preserved. Considering the mild conditions of click chemistry, it is an ideal tool for modification of antibodies without compromising their binding affinity towards cell surface antigens. \n\nFor site-specific conjugation of an antibody with a drug molecule to obtain homogenous, stable, and potent ADCs, noncanonical amino acids have been used for expression into an antibody. For example, an azido-modified amino acid was inserted into an antibody 120 . This allowed specific click conjugation with an alkyne tethered to a drug molecule. As a proof of concept, the 4D5 antibody against HER/neu (a wellknown target in tumor) was modified with auristatin F (AF) or a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) on four different sites: two positions (H274, H359) in the heavy chain and two positions in the light chain (L70, L81). These four sites were selected because they are distant from the binding site and hinge region but are part of the Fc receptor domain.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutic agents that are comprised of a monoclonal antibody tethered to a potent cytotoxic molecule through a chemical linker. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several ADCs has provided tremendous impetus to research in this field. Most ADCs approved or in clinical development employ traditional conjugation methods that are either lysine-amide coupling or cysteine-maleimide conjugation to tether the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. These methods, though simple to use, produce heterogeneous conjugates complicating analytical characterization and batch reproducibility. The cysteine-maleimide conjugation strategy faces an additional problem of serum instability [1]. To address the shortcomings of classical conjugation, the ADC field is gradually moving towards site-specific conjugation approaches. The site-specific approaches improve the homogeneity of ADC products, the manufacturability and the ease of characterization [2,3]. Further, in certain cases, site-specific conjugates have been reported to show improved efficacy, stability and safety [4][5][6]. \n\nTo date, numerous site-specific conjugation approaches have been developed, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Despite the availability of a plethora of site-specific conjugation approaches, most methods developed to date lead to a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of only two. Branched linkers based on site-specific conjugation approaches may be used for loading multiple payload molecules onto an antibody but have not been fully explored. These linkers may lead to site-specific high-DAR antibody-drug conjugates with minimal disruption to the antibody structure and may even enhance ADC efficacy. To date, only a handful of branched linkers have been described in the literature that could lead to a high DAR in a site-specific manner. Anamiet et al. developed branched linkers utilizing microbial transglutaminase-mediated site-specific conjugation to provide a platform for attaining a DAR of 4 [7].",

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that site-specific conjugation offers significant advantages over conventional conjugation chemistries used to make antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs). Site-specific payload placement allows for control over both the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and the conjugation site, both of which play an important role in governing the pharmacokinetics (PK), disposition, and efficacy of the ADC. In addition to the DAR and site of conjugation, linker composition also plays an important role in the properties of an ADC. We have previously reported a novel site-specific conjugation platform comprising linker payloads designed to selectively react with site-specifically engineered aldehyde tags on an antibody backbone. This chemistry results in a stable C\u2013C bond between the antibody and the cytotoxin payload, providing a uniquely stable connection with respect to the other linker chemistries used to generate ADCs. The flexibility and versatility of the aldehyde tag conjugation platform has enabled us to undertake a systematic evaluation of the impact of conjugation site and linker composition on ADC properties. Here, we describe the production and characterization of a panel of ADCs bearing the aldehyde tag at different locations on an IgG1 backbone conjugated using Hydrazino-iso-Pictet-Spengler (HIPS) chemistry. We demonstrate that in a panel of ADCs with aldehyde tags at different locations, the site of conjugation has a dramatic impact on in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior in rodents; this advantage translates to an improved safety profile in rats as compared to a conventional lysine conjugate.",

            "text": "ADCs hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer treatment by increasing antitumour efficacy while overcoming the collateral damage associated with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs via targeted delivery. Although the approvals of ado-trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin in this decade have set the tone for the future of ADCs, 1 adverse effects are known to occur before the optimal therapeutic dose is reached with these drugs, hence limiting their clinical outcome. In order to widen the therapeutic window, strategies involving target selection, innovative linker technologies and payload potency need to   evolve to design the ideal \"magic bullet\". Here we report a novel Pt(II) based linker that re-bridges the antibody chains post reduction and provides a facile alternative to address the key issues of ADC linkers. The presence of strong interactions between the antibody chains in the Pt-based ADC preserves the higher order structural stability when compared to the maleimide-based ADC, in which non-covalent forces exist as elucidated with three different antibodies. The labile C-S bond in the case of maleimide, is overcome by the strength of the Pt-S interaction imparting the necessary stability to the ADC. Additionally, for any IgG1, the location of inter-chain cysteines is conserved and hence, the attachment of the linker-drug is site-speci\ue103c and the high efficiency of the Pt-S reaction ensures that the resulting ADC is homogeneous.\n\nWhile the premature release of the linker-drug from the antibody would result in off-target effects, a very stable linker would be non-efficacious. Thus, careful selection and subsequent optimization of the payload and linker-payload combination is required to generate ADCs with maximal therapeutic efficacy. Another crucial factor for achieving success at the clinic is the requirement for the production of homogeneous ADCs, which may even become a prerequisite for future FDA approvals. However, ADCs prepared through conventional linker technologies, such as conjugation to lysines of the antibody, exhibit heterogeneity with multiple species, which is addressed by the Pt-based re-bridging of the disul\ue103des on de\ue103ned cysteines. On the other hand, conjugation to cy",

Moreover, a previous study comparing cysteine-linked ADCs derived from IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 antibodies showed similar tolerability and toxicity profiles between the IgG1 and IgG2 ADCs. 18 n-depth characterization of the drug substance and drug product is an important aspect during clinical development of therapeutic candidates, as deeper understanding of molecular attributes enhance the quality and batch consistency of the drug product. 0][21] Nevertheless, limited structural and biophysical information is available regarding IgG2 ADCs because these molecules have not been a popular choice for clinical development.

They have garnered widespread interest in drug discovery, particularly in oncology, as discrimination between healthy and malignant tissues or cells can be achieved. Nine ADCs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 80 others are currently undergoing clinical investigations for a range of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Extensive research over the past decade has highlighted the critical nature of the linkage strategy adopted to attach the payload to the antibody. Whilst early generation ADCs were primarily synthesised as heterogeneous mixtures, these were found to have sub-optimal pharmacokinetics, stability, tolerability and/or efficacy. Efforts have now shifted towards generating homogeneous constructs with precise drug loading and predetermined, controlled sites of attachment. Homogeneous ADCs have repeatedly demonstrated superior overall pharmacological profiles compared to their heterogeneous counterparts. A wide range of methods have been developed in the pursuit of homogeneity, comprising chemical or enzymatic methods or a combination thereof to afford precise modification of specific amino acid or sugar residues. In this review, we discuss advances in chemical and enzymatic methods for site-specific antibody modification that result in the generation of homogeneous ADCs.",

We show that these ADCs are synthesised almost exclusively as DAR 4 species (by HIC and mass spec), have stability in blood serum and are selective and potent against HER-2 expressing tumour cells. Moreover, we demonstrate for the \ue103rst time that both NGM-and PD-based ADC potency and selectivity translate well into therapeutic efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. Both ADC formats showed excellent tumour regression. \n\nBoth NGM and PD based ADCs are prepared by a common and simple method (Scheme 1). The four solvent accessible disul\ue103de bonds in an IgG1 are reduced using tris-2carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), followed by functional rebridging with either a NGM or a PD molecule. Conjugation with NGM is followed by hydrolysis to stabilise the conjugate, whereas PD conjugates themselves are stable. \n\nWe chose trastuzumab as our antibody platform to demonstrate disul\ue103de modi\ue103cation with PDs. Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u2122) is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting HER2 and is used for breast cancer therapy both as antibody alone 39 and as the antibody component of ADC Kadcyla\u2122. 40 We chose anti-cancer drug MMAE as a suitable payload for ADC design. 9,38,41 Lastly, we chose to  compare cleavable and non-cleavable linker designs. The cleavable linker design is the widely used cathepsin B labile valine-citruline linker. 8,9,38,42,43 t has been suggested that MMAE requires release as a free drug from the antibody linker conjugate to reach anywhere near its full potency inside the target cell. 44 However, our previously reported NGM-MMAE ADC 1 showed high potency in vitro despite using a non-cleavable linker. 26",

            "text": "A big challenge when studying ADCs is the often very high potency of the payload drug requiring the use of strict safety protocols and controlled environments. Thus, the safest alternative for preliminary studies particularly for analytical method development is to use a nontoxic model with payload molecules that mimic the structure/ behavior of the real drug-linker which facilitates the safe study of all the key steps from starting material preparation to final purification of conjugated products. The drug mimic used here was selected to be similar (e.g., solubility, absorptivity) to common drug-linkers used in marketed ADCs but avoided toxicity issues. We used a molecule composed of valine, citruline, PAB-OH, with an active maleimide terminal group, which is a common commercial ADC linker (Joubert et al., 2020). We selected a nonfluorescent small molecule because we wanted to minimize interference, and only measure the changes in protein fluorescence (Supporting Information: Figures S2 and S3). \n\nConjugates were prepared by partial reduction of IgG disulfide bonds with TCEP. HCl for 2 h followed by alkylation with an excess of the \"drug\" linker for 2 h, at 20\u00b0C. The two-step reactions were conducted in 1 \u00d7 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes with slow stirring (using a flea magnetic follower in the cuvette with the sample holder stirrer) in the spectrometer (Supporting Information: Figure S3). A total of 24 reactions were performed, using 8 reducing agent TCEP concentrations from 0 to 50 molar excess (0, 1.25, 2.50, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 25, and 50) in triplicate. For all reactions, the same amount of \"drug\" linker (20-fold excess compared to mAb concentration) and NAC quencher (12-fold excess with respect to linker concentration) was used. The reaction mixtures were measured by absorbance and pEEM spectroscopy at 45-minute intervals during the reaction (designated Red1-/2-/3-IgG, Alk1-/2-/3-/4-IgG).",

Of particular importance has been the use of site-selective chemical conjugation methodology to address a critical cause of limited efficacy and safety: heterogeneity. The development of new methodologies and the optimization of old has inspired a generation of homogenous ADCs. These ADCs, such as one developed by Senter and co-workers, have proven to be therapeutically effective even with a relatively high DAR of 8upending the idea that a DAR of 2 to 4 is optimal and suggesting that selective, controlled conjugation of more drug molecules increases therapeutic potential. 61 Thus, the introduction of homogeneity via selective chemical conjugation is crucial in re\ue103ning the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, antigen affinity/selectivity, and drug release properties of ADCs. \n\nChemical site-selective conjugation methodologies not only provide a path to ADCs with a higher DAR, they could also enable the construction of multifunctionalized adductsthat is, a single antibody bearing two cytotoxic molecules. Recently, Chudasama, Caddick and co-workers inserted pyridazinediones bearing orthogonal 'clickable' handles into the native disul\ue103de bonds of trastuzumab. 68 Two orthogonal transformations allowed for the introduction of both a drug (Dox-N 3 ) and a \ue104uorophore (sulfo-Cy5-N 3 ). This work established the principles for the synthesis of dual-modi\ue103ed ADCs. Now, the creation and in vivo evaluation of ADCs bearing a double payload are required for development of next-generation ADCs. \n\nThe application of chemical site-selective conjugation strategies to the construction of ADCs has improved not only the stability and homogeneity but also the \ue104exibility of ADCs. Thus, ADCs remain at the vanguard of targeted therapeutics, offering the promise of a novel, effective treatment for cancer.",

By merging the specific binding properties of antibodies to the potency of small molecules, ADCs are designed to selectively deliver cell-killing agents to targeted pathogenic tissues, while limiting systemic toxicity. Most of the ADCs developed so far are potential anticancer agents and nine of them were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various types of cancer (Table 1). Many other ADCs are currently in advanced clinical trials not only for anticancer applications [1][2][3][4][5] but also to treat intracellular Staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection [6], for the targeted delivery of kinase inhibitors [7], as well as ADCs with anti-inflammatory properties [8,9]. \n\nIn most approved and clinical-stage ADCs, the toxic payloads are microtubule disruptors or DNA-damaging agents [10,11]. In the first and second generations of ADCs, those payloads were conjugated to antibody component in a stochastic manner, leading to heterogeneous mixtures of chemically distinct molecules varying in both drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and conjugation sites [1]. This last decade, with the aim to better control the position and the number of drug loads, new conjugation strategies were developed to access a new generation of ADCs with improved homogeneity [1,2,12,13]. Those site-specific reactions rely on the insertion of engineered cysteine residues [14] or unnatural amino acids within the antibodies core [15,16], enzymatic conjugation [17][18][19], cross-link of the reduced interchain disulfides with rebridging chemical reagents [20], and glycan-mediated conjugation [21]. The conjugating linkers between payload and antibody are generally classified into cleavable and noncleavable ones, which can behave quite differently in a biological system [22].",

The success of the ADC is partly based on the stability and successful cleavage of selective linkers for the delivery of the payload. The current research focuses on overcoming intrinsic shortcomings that impact the successful development of ADCs. This review summarizes marketed and recently approved ADCs, compares the features of various linker designs and payloads commonly used for ADC conjugation, and outlines cancer specific ADCs that are currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. In addition, it addresses the issues surrounding drug resistance and strategies to overcome resistance, the impact of a narrow therapeutic index on treatment outcomes, the impact of drug\u2013antibody ratio (DAR) and hydrophobicity on ADC clearance and protein aggregation.",

Furthermore, the long half-life of the acidic tripeptide linkers, as seen for EVCit and DVCit probes 1c, d, will be useful for constructing small molecule-based drug conjugates for targeted therapy 49,50 .",

For instance, ADCs bearing anti-mitotic drugs have demonstrated increased therapeutic efficacy. 4 Nonetheless, developing successful ADCs requires many considerations including antigen target, antibody, linker design, and payload. 5\u22129 Additionally, conjugation strategies, which dictate factors such as drug loading and stability, can greatly influence therapeutic outcomes. In particular, ADCs synthesized by conjugation to reduced interchain cysteine (Cys) sulfhydryl groups or lysine sidechain amines yield heterogeneous conjugates that have been associated with aggregation, inconsistent pharmacokinetic profiles, and toxicity. 10\u221213 One approach that can potentially overcome many of these limitations is the site-specific conjugation of antibodies that have been engineered to contain Cys residues within the heavy or light chains (THIOMABs). 14 These THIOMABs can be labeled to homogeneity without disruption of the immunoglobulin architecture. 12,14\u221219 Antibody engineering methods have been required to identify suitable maleimide\u2212thiol linkage sites because local structural and chemical environments dictate reactivity and conjugate stability. 15,16,19 Further, maleimide\u2212thiol linkages are susceptible to hydrolysis and the retro-Michael reaction which can lead to thioether exchange with free Cys, glutathione, and the serum protein albumin. 6,16,20\u221223 For example, conjugation of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to anti-HER2 (trastuzumab) THIOMABs has illustrated the importance of the relationship between conjugation site and therapeutic efficacy ( Figure 1A). 16 These studies showed that THIOMAB conjugate stability was inversely correlated with predicted fractional solvent accessibility, as THIOMABs labeled in regions with high-predicted fractional solvent accessibility (Fc-S396C) demonstrated poor pharmacokin",

The main idea is to generate bi or tri-functionalized linkers, in which orthogonal reactions allow the incorporation of different payloads using covalent bonds (Levengood et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2018;Zhang L. et al., 2021;Yamazaki et al., 2021). Levengood et al. (2017) prepared a linker with sequential Cys residues with orthogonal protection to enable site-specific conjugation of each drug and conjugated to IgG1 through the reduced interchain disulfides of the antibody and stable maleimide linkage. In 2018, a novel heterotrifunctional linker was developed by Kumar et al. (2018), providing a flexible platform that allows the coupling of two different drugs via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and via oxime linkage using ketone as starting functional group, but also the conjugation to the antibody through cysteine-maleimide reaction.",

            "text": "Over the past ten years, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have made considerable progress in the field of cancer therapy. ADCs utilize the high binding specificity and affinity of antibodies to target antigens and specifically direct potent cytotoxic payloads into cancer cells [62]. The structure of an ADC contains four components: the monoclonal antibody, cytotoxic payload, linker, and conjugation site [63]. The linker used in the construction of ADCs is responsible for the formation of stable conjugates in the systemic circulation and the release of the payload after the ADC internalization at the target site [64]. Currently, there are three methods commonly used to bind linkers to antibodies, namely through chemical coupling strategy, using enzyme catalysis [63], and using antibodies with added cysteine residues or designed to be doped with unnatural amino acids [65]. Structural modifications to antibodies may lead to changes in antibody activity, such as the targeting ability, and also pose a challenge for scaled-up antibody production. \n\nTherefore, an alternative approach to the production of homogeneous ADCs using unmodified antibody scaffolds would be advantageous [66]. As discussed in the previous sections, there are many moieties with high Fc affinity. It is simpler and easier to conjugate drugs to these moieties to form Fc-binding moieties-drug conjugates than to chemically conjugate payloads to antibodies. The drug payloads could be non-covalently conjugated into antibodies by means of the high binding affinity between the Fc affinity ligand and Fc region of the antibody. A significant advantage of this approach is that it can quickly conjugate drugs to site-specific Fc regions to obtain homogeneous non-covalent conjugates. Given the relatively conserved sequence of IgG Fc regions, it is a potentially scalable or broad-spectrum strategy [66]. \n\nAs shown in Table 3, several studies have used different affinity ligands to generate non-covalent ADCs. Gupta et al. [6] have developed multivalent and affinity-guided antibody empowerment technology (MAGNET) to engineer the non-covalent ADC.",

In this period chemistry enabled the enrichment of the pool of available payloads by establishing a collection of linking methods to connect drug payloads. This process was also aided by the increasing collection of molecular modelling tools that were adapted to this compound class [161,162]. Medicinal chemists have also studied systematically the relationship between the chemical nature of the link between the antibody and the drug, and the properties of the ADC, which led to an improved design of new ADCs. Finally, the recently developed selective chemical modifications of monoclonal antibodies resulted in an improved control of the ADC composition, which in turn ensures a better control of ADC properties. In spite of this significant progress in the chemistry of antibodies-drugs conjugation modalities there is still a lot to learn and explore regarding the conversion of this knowledge into better antibody-drug conjugates.",

The former two conjugation methods produce heterogeneous products containing a mixture of different molar ratios of drug (0-8 drugs) to antibody linked at different conjugation sites. 5,6 In contrast, ADCs derived from engineered cysteines (THIOMAB platform) result in homogenous preparation with defined stoichiometry (2 drugs per antibody). 7 He showcased several examples of in vivo efficacy and safety studies on conventional ADCs and their corresponding engineered ADCs in his presentation. Despite having a lower drug load, engineered ADCs with 2 drugs per antibody showed similar in vivo efficacy compared with conventional ADCs with an average of 3.5 drugs per antibody. This was reasoned to be due to improved PK properties of engineered ADCs compared with conventional ADCs.7 Engineered ADCs in the context of a non-cleavable maytansine (MCC-DM1) or a cleavable auristatin-based linker drug (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) displayed reduced liver and bone marrow toxicity compared with conventional ADCs. 7,8 r. Junutula highlighted the role of the conjugation site in the in vivo stability and therapeutic activity of ADCs. He summarized the data on engineered ADCs using three trastuzumab THIOMAB variants that differed in solvent accessibility and local charge. These three variants had similar in vitro properties (binding to target antigen and in vitro potency), but differed in their in vivo efficacy and PK properties. A detailed biochemical mechanism on the stability of cysteine-maleimide-based antibody conjugates in plasma in vitro and in vivo was dissected and discussed.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging novel anticancer drugs consisting of three components: a tumor-specific antibody or antibody fragment, a cleavable or non-cleavable chemical conjugate and a potent cytotoxic molecule. Due to the targeting advantages of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule drugs, ADCs are emerging as a new cancer treatment option [95,96]. \n\nTwo main types of conjugation are commonly used in ADC design: conventional conjugations and site-specific conjugations [97]. For a long time, the conventional approach to ADCs has used lysine or cysteine residues that are exposed on the surface as anchoring sites to join drug molecules. This choice is based on the fact that thiol groups are widely present in living organisms and have a high capacity to interact with other biomolecules such as proteins and enzymes. For instance, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is one of the four approved ADCs on the market that utilizes side-chain lysines to link the potent microtubule protein inhibitor DM1 to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer [98]. While this approach is easy to apply, these conventional conjugation methods result in multiphase byproducts with different drug distributions for each mAb, unspliced and overspliced mAbs. In contrast, site-specific concatenation using genetically engineered sites is an effective method for achieving more homogeneous ADCs. This method mainly links medications and antibodies particularly by employing glycans, short peptide tags, unnatural amino acids, or specific amino acids [99]. For instance, the homogenous anti-HER2 ADC ARX788, which was created in 2020, produces a drug-to-antibody ratio of 1.9 by means of a non-removable abelastatin (AS269) drug junction and a special unnatural amino acid affixation technique.",

The antibody and the chemotherapy or payload are attached by a chemical structure called the linker. The strategy for the development of this type of drug was based on several rational pillars, including the use of a very potent payload and the use of specific antibodies acting only on antigens expressed on tumoral cells. In this article, by using data from all approved ADCs that have received regulatory approval, we analyze the potential contribution of each ADC component to preclinical activity. We suggest that payload potency and the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) have a less relevant role in relation to efficacy than previously considered. Additionally, we have observed that some ADCs have been developed against antigens also present in non-transformed tissues, which could suggest that TAA specificity is not a mandatory requirement. Finally, we have identified that ADCs with payloads harboring more favorable physicochemical characteristics showed better potential activity. In this article, we also review other aspects that should be taken into consideration for ADC design, including linker structure, stability, conjugation type, pharmacokinetics, receptor internalization, and recycling. Based on currently available data, our study summaries different concepts that should be considered in the design of novel ADCs in the future.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are mAbs that are chemically linked to cytotoxic agents. Although the concept exists for decades, only recent advances in linker, drug, and antibody technology have turned ADCs into valuable therapeutic agents as illustrated by the recent approvals of brentuximab-vedotin (Adcetris) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, marketed as Kadcyla). In addition to these approved ADCs, more than 30 other ADCs are currently in clinical trials of which the majority are based on linker-drugs (LD) that are similar to those used in brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 (1,2). Like many ADCs in development, both brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 carry tubulin binders (an auristatin and a maytansinoid, respectively) that inhibit tubulin polymerization and cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of the targeted cell. Linkers are either cleavable linkers, for example, peptide linkers (such as the di-peptide valine-citrulline used in brentuximab-vedotin) or non-cleavable linkers, for example, amide or thioether linkers (as used in T-DM1) that depend on complete degradation of the mAb in the lysosome and subsequent release of the cytotoxic agent.\n\nAlthough the marketed ADCs have an improved therapeutic index (TI) compared with classical nontargeted chemotherapeutic agents, there is still room for improvement. Brentuximab-vedotin, for example, reaches its MTD in human patients at 2.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is determined by induction of peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (3)(4)(5). Similarly, the MTD of T-DM1 is 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is also driven by unacceptable thrombocytopenia and hepato-toxicity at higher dosages, and is accompanied by peripheral sensory neuropathy as well",

ADCs are comprised of a drug with cytotoxic activity cross-linked to a monoclonal antibody, targeting antigens expressed at higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells. By providing a selective targeting mechanism for cytotoxic drugs, ADCs improve the therapeutic index in clinical practice. In this review, the chemistry of ADC linker conjugation together with strategies adopted to improve antibody tolerability (by reducing antigenicity) are examined, with particular attention to ADCs approved by the regulatory agencies (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for treating cancer patients. Recent developments in engineering Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and antibody humanization have greatly reduced some of the problems of the first generation of ADCs, beset by problems, such as random coupling of the payload and immunogenicity of the antibody. ADC development and clinical use is a fast, evolving area, and will likely prove an important modality for the treatment of cancer in the near future.",

            "text": "In this review, we have described the most important and recent examples of antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs) containing metal-based and nature-inspired payloads. Particular emphasis has been placed on the different synthetic strategies that can be employed to conjugate the antibody with the selected payload, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Conventional methods, such as maleimide and succinimide conjugation methods, as well as classical condensation reactions, are the ones most commonly used for both metallodrugs and bioactive natural compounds payloads. However, alternative strategies, such as photoconjugation reactions, are rapidly evolving. These non-conventional methods allow for milder conditions and render the formation of target ADCs more selective, thereby limiting the side reactions and/or mixtures of ADCs, which are difficult to separate and identify. \n\nIn addition to the different synthetic pathways, we have summarized the therapeutic/diagnostic properties of ADCs bearing metal-based and nature-inspired payloads, as reported by the various authors. Most of the reviewed contributions highlighted that ADCs exhibit a more selective therapeutic activity towards cancer cells/tissues compared to non-conjugated payloads, as well as reduced side effects in animal models. \n\nIn summary, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a rapidly evolving frontier in oncology and targeted therapy, with a future that promises significant advancements in cancer treatment. The innovative design of ADCs, which combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, offers a targeted approach which can be used to destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. This precise mechanism of action has already shown impressive clinical efficacy in treating various malignancies, and ongoing research and development efforts suggest an even more transformative impact in the coming years. The future of ADCs looks particularly promising due to several key factors: (i) Advances in linker technology, which connects the antibody to the drug, are expected to enhance the stability and controlled release of the cytotoxic agent.

However, the mainstay of an effective ADC lies in its linker-the glue that couples the drug and the antibody together until the ADC reaches the cancer cell. Conventionally, linker-drugs have been coupled to either lysines on the antibody, as in ado-trastuzumab emtansine, 3 or to cysteines via maleimide chemistry, as in brentuximab vedotin (Scheme 1a and b). 2 Both technologies have major limitations, such as the former producing heterogeneous ADCs 4,5 and Scheme 1 Comparison of conventional linker technologies with a Pt(II)-linker. (a) Conjugation to lysines results in a heterogeneous mixture.

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Another modification, using cysteine bridging bifunctional groups is to reduce the maximum number of cytotoxic drugs attached to a mAb from eight to four. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed to obtain site-specific conjugations where sites of attachment of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody are precisely defined. These technologies are as follows: (a) applying engineered cysteine (such as THIOMAB enabling site-specific conjugation on only the heavy chain of the antibody) [38]; \n\n(b) introducing unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis to proteins and antibodies (such as incorporating p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine into an IgG1) [39]; (c) using enzymatic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate site-specific conjugations (such as using engineered glycotransferases, transglutaminases, transpeptidase sortase, or formyl glycine generating enzymes to form the site-specific functionalization of antibodies) [40][41][42][43][44][45]; and (d) using tubulin-tag labeling strategies [46][47][48].",

            "text": "Then, it catalyzes the linking of glycine-derived payloads to the newly generated C-terminus, generating a peptide bond at physiological temperature and pH [140]. This approach was applied to different antibodies such as anti-CD30 and anti-Her2 with penta-glycine tagged linkers containing maytansine and MMAE [141]. Both ADCs display in vitro cell killing activity comparable to the classic conjugates. The enzymatically generated trastuzumab-maytansine tested in vivo led to complete regression similar to Kadcyla. In another example anthracycline-based antibody-drug conjugates were generated by sortase-mediated conjugation [142]. The ADCs were synthesized using a highly potent anthracycline toxin derivative PNU-159682, and a non-cleavable peptide linker conjugated to the two previously described mAbs. Interestingly, the conjugation efficiency through this technology was even higher than for Adcetris and Kadcyla analogues. Consequently, the conjugation efficiency depends on the nature of the linker-payload structure. In addition, Stefan et al. demonstrated that the obtained PNU-159682 ADC had high in vitro and in vivo stability and exhibited potencies exceeding those ADCs that contained tubulin-targeting payloads. \n\nAnother emerging new methodology is the site-specific antibody labelling through a tyrosine tag genetically fused to the C-terminus of the mAb light chains (Figure 60d) [143]. Given the inaccessibility of the native tyrosine, Bruins and coworkers used an engineered tetra-glycyltyrosine residue as a tag. It offered an easy reachable site for coupling, where mushroom tyrosinase oxidized the tyrosine to 1,2-quinone allowing a strain-promoted cycloaddition with various bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) derivatives. This approach worked efficiently with an MMAE containing BCN There are accumulating evidences that the enzymatic methods enable easily achieved amino acid modifications.",

The mAbs carry ADCs to target cells by affinity binding to antigens expressed on cell surface, and subsequently become internalized, undergo degradation followed by the release of toxic payloads within target cells. This design confers increased specificity and reduced toxicity compared to conventional pharmaceutics such as genotoxic drugs 1e3 .\n\nAs a novel class of therapeutics, ADCs are embracing everevolving technologies in linker and payload chemistry. Specifically, linkers can be classified as cleavable chemical spacers involving hydrozone, disulfide and di/tri/tetra-peptide bonds and noncleavable spacers such as thioether and pyrophosphate diester 4 . The differences in chemical stability conferred by linkers lead to varied catabolic profiles and hence ADC therapeutic efficacies in target cells or organelles. Moreover, highly potent cytotoxic agents with defined mechanisms of action such as maytansinoid and auristatin with microtubule inhibitory functions or DNA double-strand breakers, cross-linkers and alkylators are often selected as payloads 5 . In addition, the site of conjugation, lysine or cysteine residues, also affects ADC catabolic and pharmacokinetic liabilities 6 . Collectively, the plethora of choices offered by conjugation site, linkers and payloads confers versatile combinations, leading to currently over 100 ADCs in clinical trials and numerous ADCs as preclinical candidates 7,8 . Therefore, the concomitant task of druggability screening and quality assessment for ADC candidates becomes challenging, necessitating an approach that efficiently and comprehensively evaluates ADC attributes before proceeding to expensive and time-consuming in vivo experiments 8,9 . Nevertheless, conventional in vitro assaying techniques such as cytotoxicity assay merely provides a final functional readout while lacking a comprehensive evaluation of how each step ranging from antigen binding, internalization, trafficking to lysosomal proteolysismediated payload release functions and affects payload release and the ensuing cell killing effect 4 .

[1][2][3][4] By harnessing cell killing agents to the specific targeting ability of antibodies, antibody conjugates Ivyspring International Publisher maximize the anti-tumor activity of these agents while minimizing exposure to normal tissue. Because of their exceptional potency and selectivity, eleven ADCs (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Brentuximab vedotin, Trastuzumab emtansine, Inotuzumab ozogamicin, Polatuzumab vedotin, Enfortumab vedotin, Trastuzumab deruxtecan, Sacituzumab govitecan, Belantamab mafodotin, Moxetumomab pasudotox, and Loncastuximab tesirine) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of various types of cancer. Production of these small molecule-antibody conjugates has relied exclusively on either the random acylation of antibody lysine residues with highly reactive esters or the random alkylation of antibody cysteine residues with maleimides. [1,3,5] Both of these methodologies inevitably yield heterogeneous products with variable drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) and mixed pharmacological properties, which can be challenging for the manufacturing control. [6][7][8] Furthermore, a recent study indicates that ADC with a fixed DAR has optimal potency and safety profile. [9] Thus, site-specific conjugation methods for producing homogeneous ADCs with constant DAR are highly desired. \n\nAdvances in antibody engineering and bioorthogonal chemistry have made it possible to prepare homogeneous site-specific antibody conjugates that exhibit enhanced stability, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have begun to fulfil their promise as targeted cancer therapeutics with ten clinical approvals to date. As the field matures, much attention has focused upon the key factors required to produce safe and efficacious ADCs. Recently the role that linker-payload reagent design has on the properties of ADCs has been highlighted as an important consideration for developers. We have investigated the effect of incorporating hydrophilic macrocycles into reagent structures on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of ADCs. Bis-sulfone based disulfide rebridging reagents bearing Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE linker-payloads were synthesized with a panel of cyclodextrins and crown ethers integrated into their structures via a glutamic acid branching point. Brentuximab was selected as a model antibody and ten ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 were prepared for biological evaluation. In vitro, the ADCs prepared showed broadly similar potency (range: 16\u201334 pM) and were comparable to Adcetris\u00ae (16 pM). In vivo, the cyclodextrin containing ADCs showed greater efficacy than Adcetris\u00ae and the most efficacious variant (incorporating a 3\u2032-amino-\u03b1-cyclodextrin component) matched a 24-unit poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing comparator. The ADCs bearing crown ethers also displayed enhanced in vivo efficacy compared to Adcetris\u00ae, the most active variant (containing a 1-aza-42-crown-14 macrocycle) was superior to an analogous ADC with a larger 24-unit PEG chain. In summary, we have demonstrated that hydrophilic macrocycles can be effectively incorporated into ADC reagent design and offer the potential for enhanced alternatives to established drug-linker architectures.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are IgGs conjugated with cytotoxic small molecules through chemical linkers. By specifically targeting cancer cells and selective delivery of highly cytotoxic drugs, ADCs fundamentally revolutionized the way of cancer immunotherapy and chemotherapy (125). Currently, four ADCs (Adcetris \u00ae , Kadcyla \u00ae , Besponsa \u00ae , and Mylotarg \u00ae ) have been approved by FDA with more than 80 ADCs under clinical evaluations (126). The mode of action of ADCs involves antigenmediated endocytosis, followed by the release of drugs by either lysosomal degradation or hydrolytic/proteolytic cleavage (127). The methods for conjugating the small molecule drugs onto IgG represent one of the key technologies in ADC development. The conventional conjugation approaches involve random addition of drugs onto Lys or reduced Cys residues by amide coupling and maleimide alkylation chemistry, which leads to highly heterogeneous mixtures with different drug-antibody ratios and inconsistent yield (128). This heterogeneity negatively impacts the in vivo efficacy, stability, PK of ADCs (129). Thus, site-specific conjugation methods are highly pursued (130). Conjugation through IgG-Fc N-glycans represents one of the most widely used site-specific conjugation methods (131). Glycosite-specific conjugation proceeds with the introduction of a chemically active moiety onto the Fc N-glycans followed by reacting with payloads carrying another chemically active group. In this method, native IgG with heterogeneous N-glycans is deglycosylated by a wild-type endoglycosidase followed by the transglycosylation of a chemical group capped homogenous N-glycan substrate. The transglycosylation is catalyzed by an endoglycosynthase (a mutant of endoglycosidase) that lacks hydrolytic activity but possesses transglycosylation activity (132). Subsequently, the drug payload can be conjugated by biocompatible chemical reactions such as click chemistry and oximation.",

            "text": "Based on this, they developed the GlycoConnect coupling technology, which can use natural glycosylation sites to achieve site-specific coupling [148]. The technique is based on 2 processes: first, enzyme remodeling (modification and labeling with azide), and then the linking of payloads based on copper-free click chemistry. The monoclonal antibody can be converted into a stable conjugated ADC in just a few days. MedImmune, a division of AstraZeneca that develops ADC drugs, has developed a family of ADC drug candidates through the CuAAC click chemical link. In the series of ADC candidate drugs, monoantimicrobials targeting HER2/neu (a member of the EGFR family) are modified with an azide group, and auristatin F (a cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor) is modified with a terminal alkyne (Fig. 19B) [149]. This technology has been expanded to generate fully functional and highly stable ADCs that exhibit optimized pharmacokinetic, biological, and biophysical properties. \n\nThe development of ADCs has advanced substantially in the past decade, driven by improvements in payloads, linkers, and coupling techniques [150,151]. Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles [151,152]. Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance [153]. The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors [154]. However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms [155]. Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156].",

            "text": "Antibodies are attractive drug delivery vehicles because their binding specificity allows them to deliver payloads with minimal off-target toxicity. As such, a variety of methods have evolved to directly link a drug of interest to an antibody, thus forming antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Conventional chemical conjugation of drug payloads typically utilize the amines of lysine or thiols of cysteine residues present in the amino acid sequence of the antibody (Qasba 2015;Tang et al., 2019). This approach results in heterogeneous ADCs with greater susceptibility to aggregation, decreased antibody stability, or cytotoxicity that together pose barriers to effective clinical use and increase regulatory scrutiny. \n\nThese pitfalls have spurred researchers to create active, homogenous ADC populations with one such class of these drugs known as glycosite-specific ADCs (gsADCs) (Tang et al., 2019). These glycoengineering strategies take advantage of the conserved, biantennary N-glycosylation site present at the asparagine 297 residue of the CH2 regions of the Fc domain. One strategy uses metabolic glycoengineering to install thiol-modified fucose in Fc domain glycans (Figure 6A), which can be used as a chemical handle for drug conjugation (Figure 5A, (Okeley et al., 2013)). Another chemical method for site-specific chemical conjugation to Fc glycans involves mild periodate oxidation (Jourdian et al., 1971;Peters & Aronson Jr 1976), which selectively introduces aldehyde groups into sialic acids (Figure 5B); a downside of this approach is the low sialylation of Fc glycans, often 2% or lower. A strategy using non-natural  B, C, and D). (A) Thiols can be installed into non-natural fucose using metabolic glycoengineering and used as \"chemical handles\" to ligate drug molecules to the Fc domain glycans of antibodies using thiol-reactive maleimides (Okeley et al., 2013).",

One attractive aspect of this modality is that a new linker leads to the registration of a new biologics entity in terms of intellectual property rights, 190 allowing a huge advantage in patent space and novelty. \n\nNanobodies, 191 non-Ig-Based protein scaffolds such as DAR-Pins, 192 and peptide aptamers 193 are rising as alternatives to monoclonal antibodies with their competitive advantages (higher affinity binding, lower cost, and lower immunogenicity relative to mAbs). A wider toolbox of native amino acid conjugation methods which are orthogonal thus complementary to existing ones' synthetic scopes will open wider avenues to prepare biomolecule conjugates. \n\nOrthodox bioconjugation methods are rooted in the nucleophilicity of substituents on amino acids and therefore, the functionalisation of non-nucleophilic amino acids, such as valine, leucine, or phenylalanine, remains a challenge. An extension of metal-free, rapid and aqueous synthetic methodologies in C-H activation will provide a wider pool of potential designs for antibody conjugation linkers. \n\nWhile many reactions are reported for native amino acid functionalisation to produce antibody or protein-payload conjugate, only few has succeeded to do it in nearly 100% aqueous medium, within a short enough duration, without any potentially denaturing agents. Last but not least, atom-economy is highly important for the antibody conjugation efficiency. While disul\ue103de rebridging linker is emerging as a promising approach to control Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR), a recent preclinical study suggests that a strict control of DAR may not be the most critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy. 58 It seems that more thorough and detailed studies on different combinations of antibody, drug, linker's chemistry and conjugation site are required in order to better understand ADC's therapeutic pro\ue103le.

Additionally, the targeted antigen should be highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells in copy numbers sufficient to enable delivery of a cytotoxic dose, and it must internalize via a mechanism that permits drug access to its intracellular target. The drug must be extremely potent, and its physical properties must allow the attachment of several molecules to the antibody without inducing aggregation of the ADC. Finally, the linker must help to solubilize the often-hydrophobic drug (a molecule containing the drug and linker is typically prepared and then conjugated to an antibody under aqueous conditions), must be stable during circulation so that the drug is not prematurely released, and, depending on the application, may require intracellular cleavage to facilitate release of the free drug. 7 Much work has been directed toward optimizing these details of ADC composition and manufacturing over the last 50 years. However, until the past decade, the fundamental conjugation chemistries used to connect the protein and drug-linker moiety remained essentially unchanged. Nonspecific acylation of lysine residues with activated esters and alkylation of cysteine thiols with maleimides are two classic bioconjugation methods that were used to make the first generation of ADCs. For example, both Mylotarg and Kadcyla are produced by nonspecific conjugation to lysine residues, 8,9 whereas Adcetris is constructed by alkylation of cysteine thiols that are exposed by prior reduction of the conserved hinge region disulfide bonds. 10 These conjugations are problematic, however, because they produce products that are heterogeneous in two regards illustrated here for lysine conjugation ( Figure 1A): 11 first, the product population contains conjugates with a variable drug-toantibody ratio (DAR). Second, any two conjugates with the same DAR are likely regioisomers, as many surface-accessible lysine residues (as well as the N termini of the light and heavy chains) are potential candidates for modification.

Lysine conjugation results in 0-8 conjugated molecules per antibody (Fig. 5), and peptide mapping has determined that conjugation occurs on both the heavy and light chain at ~20 different lysine residues (40 lysines per mAb). Therefore, greater than one million different ADC species can be generated. 6,[39][40][41] Cysteine conjugation occurs after reduction of four inter-chain disulfide bonds, and the conjugation is thus limited to the eight exposed sulfhydryl groups. Linkerdrugs per antibody can range from 0-8 (Fig. 5), generating more than one hundred different ADC species. 42 The diversity in heterogeneity of an ADC mixture is 2-fold because these ADC species differ in drug load and conjugation site. Therefore, each species may have distinct properties, which may result in a wide range of in vivo PK properties. In addition, batch-to-batch consistency in ADC production can be challenging and may require diligent manufacturing capabilities. Site-specific conjugation, in which a known number of linker-drugs are consistently conjugated to defined sites, is one way to overcome these challenges. 43,44 Heterogeneity is minimized and ADC properties are more predictable, with consistent conjugate production from batch to batch. Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is precisely controlled and can be tailored to various linkerdrugs, producing either 2-or 4-DAR site-specific ADCs ( Table  1). Thus, site-specific conjugation is a major improvement to ADC drug development and it is no surprise that researchers have focused on a number of methods to achieve sitespecific conjugation.",

            "text": "Despite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

            "text": "In this paper, a process of computational construction of ADCs has been described, choosing surface lysines as the antibody conjugation sites. For this purpose, drug PDB files from the Open National Cancer Institute Database, antibody PDB files from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and the PDB file of the non-cleavable linker molecule C 15 N were used. Between the linker and the drug, as well as between the antibody lysine and the linker-drug conjugate, hydrogen bonds were formed. The change in the configuration of the molecules was accomplished using the affine transformation. \n\nThe method described in this paper represents one of the many ways a drug can be conjugated with an antibody. Parameters such as the amino acid participating in the conjugation, the DAR, the type of linker and drug used, as well as the chemical bonds formed between the components of the conjugate can vary. Besides lysine, other natural or synthetic amino acids such as cysteine, selenocysteine, or acetylphenylalanine can be connected with a linker-drug conjugate. In addition, other non-cleavable or cleavable linkers can be used, while maytansinoids, auristatins, calicheamicins, and duocarmycins can be used as cytotoxic substances. \n\nAn example of a different conjugation technique is the formation of a covalent bond between an amino acid and a reactive functional group pendent to the linker-drug conjugate.

            "text": "All ADCs currently applied in the clinic, or in clinical trials, have been manufactured using chemical conjugation involving linkers that covalently attach the toxic payload to either primary amino groups of lysine residues in the antibody structure, or to free thiol groups that are usually generated by mild reduction of intra-chain disulphide bridges of the antibody [14,15]. Because antibodies contain many lysine and cysteine residues, this approach produces heterogeneous mixtures of drug substances that present challenges with respect to analytical characterization and manufacturing. Despite their average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 3.5 to 4, currently approved ADCs comprise individual components with DARs ranging from 0 to 8 [14], each behaving differently with respect to their pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles [16]. \n\nIn addition to the inherent heterogeneity of ADCs generated by this standard chemical conjugation, the maleimide-based linkers used in all ADCs currently in clinical trials and on the market have been found to exhibit instability in human serum. The maleimide-linker reaction can be reversed by the free thiol group of cysteine-34 in human serum albumin by a retro-Michael reaction [17]. This leads to a certain level of premature and systemic release of toxic payload from the ADCs, before they have reached their cancer targets. This is likely to have a negative impact on the efficacy and side-effect profile of such maleimide linker-containing ADCs. \n\nAs a result of these short-comings of traditional chemical conjugation, there is currently great interest in the further development of drug conjugation technologies, not only on sitespecific payload conjugation to generate homogeneous ADC drug substances [14,18], but also on novel linkers that avoid maleimide-based chemistries with suboptimal in vivo stability 19]. \n\nOne possible solution to both problems with current ADC formats is the enzymatic conjugation of payloads [14,18], e.g. by using sortase enzymes.",

We have developed branched ADC linkers that enable site-specific and quantitative installation of two identical payload molecules onto a single antibody through orthogonal strainpromoted azide-dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) cycloaddition 27,28 . To enable assembly of dual-drug ADCs using this technology, we designed and synthesized new branched linkers bearing azide and methyltetrazine groups as orthogonal clickable handles ( Fig. 1 and see Supplementary Notes for chemical structure and synthesis details). We chose methyltetrazine-trans-cyclooctene (TCO) as the secondary click chemistry pair for the following reasons: (1) methyltetrazine-TCO cycloaddition does not cause cross conjugation between the azide-DBCO click chemistry pair; (2) methyltetrazine-TCO cycloaddition is a fast bioorthogonal reaction (k 2 = 820 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 29 with excellent biocompatibility; and (3) unlike unsubstituted tetrazine, methyltetrazine is stable enough to withstand degradation throughout the linker synthesis and ensure a long shelf life of the final products. A similar dual conjugation strategy was reported, while we were conducting this study; however, construction of dual-drug ADCs was not attempted 30 . As click reaction counterparts, we designed payload modules consisting of either DBCO or TCO as a click pair, polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, glutamic acid-valine-citrulline (GluValCit) cleavable linker, p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) group, and payload (MMAE or MMAF). The GluValCit linker system developed by our group ensures ADC in vivo efficacy while minimizing premature linker degradation in human and mouse plasma 31 . Dual conjugation of MMAE and MMAF was selected to make ADCs capable of killing a broad range of breast cancer cells.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now established as an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There are currently seven FDA-approved ADCs, with at least 60 more in clinical development. 1 The success of ADCs arises from the combination of the exquisite cell-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule chemotherapies. However, for the mAb and drug to exert their maximum therapeutic potential, the covalent linker between the two groups must exhibit the following properties: (1) high plasma stability; the long circulatory lifetimes (t 1/2 > 1 week) of ADCs places stringent stability requirements on the linker to avoid off-target payload release. (2) High aqueous solubility to aid bioconjugation of lipophilic payloads and avoid antibody aggregation. (3) Release of a potent cytotoxin from the antibody in the target cell. 2 The majority of ADCs employ antibodies that target internalising antigens, overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon antibody-antigen binding at the target cell, the ADC is endocytosed and trafficked to the highly hydrolytic lysosomal compartments, where the antibody is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 3 In the case of a non-cleavable linker, the active intracellular cytotoxin is released as the linker-payload with the terminal amino acid from the mAb still attached. 4 Conversely, a cleavable linker is designed to release the unmod-i\ue103ed drug at this point, or upon subsequent entry to the cytosol.\n\nCleavable linkers are generally preferred to non-cleavable linkers in ADC research for a number of reasons. 5 First, traceless drug release allows the unmodi\ue103ed payload to perform its intracellular function without an unwanted linker appendage, thereby maximising cytotoxicity. Second, the unmodi\ue103ed payload can be uncharged, allowing it to diffuse into 'bystander' tumour cells that may not be expressing the target antigen. This 'bystander effect' provides an important mechanism for eradicating tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression. 6 Enzyme",

This review describes the analytical methods that have been used in their physicochemical characterization. The selection of the most appropriate methods for a specific ADC is heavily dependent on the properties of the linker, the drug, and the choice of attachment sites (lysines, inter-chain cysteines, Fc glycans). Improvements in analytical techniques such as protein mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis have significantly increased the quality of information that can be obtained for use in product and process characterization, and for routine lot release and stability testing.",

In general, linkers used in ADCs should be stable and avoid prerelease of the payload during circulation in the blood. At the same time linkers should be amenable to release the payload after internalization into tumor cells [13]. The number of drug molecules bound to antibody (DAR) and their position would greatly influence the ADCs binding affinity to antigen, aggregation, efficacy, and even safety [14]. \n\nThe most commonly used linkers conjugate the drug to antibody via a covalent bond with either thiol group of cysteines or eplison amine group of lysine on antibody. The presence of four inter-chain disulphide bridges in IgG antibody provides eight maximum possible conjugation sites [15]. Therefore, a drug conjugated via cysteine can have a DAR (No of drug molecules/antibody as measured by chromatography and mass spectrometry) up to 8 depending on the number of cysteine sites conjugated with payload [16][17][18]. In contrast to cysteine conjugation site, conjugation at lysine would generate highly heterogenous mixtures of ADCs with variable DAR ratio since antibodies have up to 30 lysine amino acids available for conjugation.

            "text": "The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology platform uses an antibody, linkers, and chemical drugs. Chemical drugs are conjugated to an antibody by chemical linkers to deliver the chemical drugs to the target [1]. Target-specific binding of a monoclonal antibody and highly potent, cytotoxic, chemical drugs are the major characteristics of ADCs for chemotherapy [2,3]. Seven ADCs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): inotuzumab emtansine (BESPONSA), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (KADCYLA), brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MYLOTARG), polatuzumab vedotin (POLIVY), enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (ENHERTU) [4][5][6][7]. The remarkable developments on ADC platform were achieved by means of the advancement on its components, including antibody engineering, site-specific conjugation, and new cytotoxic drugs. Approximately eighty ADCs were at various clinical phases in 2019 and many more ADCs are at preclinical phases [8]. Most of them have a heterogeneous characteristic, which makes manufacturing and processing as well as the analysis of pharmacokinetic profiles very challenging. Even some deleterious (or undesired) effects (higher aggregation, faster clearance, etc.) are observed in the heterogeneous ADCs. In order to overcome limitations originating from the heterogeneity, several site-specific ADCs have recently been developed. The site-specific ADC described in this paper is LCB14-0110, an ADC drug developed by LegoChem Biosciences Inc. that develops ADC linkers and toxins via the ConjuALL\u2122 platform technology.",

            "text": "We examined seven potential ADC targets for the treatment of NHL, and in all cases, the cleavable-linker ADC SPP-DM1 was  effective in xenograft models. Our observation that SPP-DM1 ADCs have activity even when the antibodies to the targets are poorly internalized seems to be a general characteristic of cleavable-linker ADCs with membrane-permeable drugs. For example, CD21 is poorly internalized (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3), yet anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was effective in our model. Similarly, others have shown an anti-CD20-AcBut-calicheamicin, which also recognizes a poorly internalized target (Fig. 3) and uses an acidcleavable linker, is effective in a xenograft model, whereas anti-CD20-amide-calicheamicin with an uncleavable linker is not (27). A likely mechanism that would explain why cleavable linkers are broadly effective and less sensitive to the biology, particularly the trafficking, of the target, is that following antibody binding, the linker is cleaved in the extracellular space and free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach it's target. One line of evidence for this mechanism is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1; anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE is efficacious, but substitution of MMAF for MMAE on this conjugate results in an inactive ADC. MMAF is a more potent drug than MMAE, but is charged and relatively membrane-impermeable (7); thus, the efficacy of the MMAE conjugate in this experiment must be due to extracellular cleavage of the linker followed by cell permeation of the liberated drug. Although the data presented suggest that cleavable linkers are broadly active, our data also show that the cleavable linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5).",

Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications.

            "text": "Presented in this review are methods for conjugation of reporter molecules and therapeutics to antibodies in a site-specific and controlled manner. These methods are based on molecules with inherent affinity for parts of the antibody that are outside of the paratope and provide the means to label any off-the-shelf antibody without modifying it first. These methods are important new tools, for making both detection antibodies and ADCs. Many of the aforementioned examples have shown the benefits of site-specific labeling compared to the traditional random conjugation methods that rely on side chain modifications, which may impair both the antibody structure and binding site. The possibility of using these methods to label antibodies even when present in complex mixtures makes them broadly applicable to many different types of samples, possibly even including cells and tissues in vivo. Thus, these antibody conjugation molecules are very important tools available for the many research fields utilizing antibodies. We believe that the use of these affinity ligands will continue to contribute to the field of antibody conjugation and ADC development in the future as they will continue to develop. Future endeavors should focus on improving the labeling efficiency as well as stability and to evaluate different combinations of ligands to increase the number of labels per antibody. This will be important both for development of ADCs with a higher drug-to-antibody-ratio (DAR) and for signal amplification during detection, to achieve more robust tools and more potent drugs. The traceless approaches mentioned above, where the affinity ligand works only as a catalyst holds great potential for simple and nonimmunogenic conjugates.",

            "text": "8 ADC prepared with the hydrophobic drug-linker val-cit-monomethylauristatin F was taken up by Kupffer cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, likely contributing to the accelerated plasma clearance in rats (6). This uptake was greatly diminished when using drug-linkers designed to minimize hydrophobicity, and the resulting ADCs exhibited plasma pharmacokinetics similar to that of the unconjugated antibody.\n\nAlthough an effective drug-linker for ADCs (8), drug-linker 1 (Fig. 1) has limitations. The physicochemical properties of the drug-linker limit the optimal drug-loading to approximately 4 drugs per antibody when conjugated as a distribution across four reducible native antibody cysteine disulfides. Early work with drug-linker 1 demonstrated that higher loaded DAR 8 conjugates, while more potent than lower loaded ADCs in vitro, were inferior in vivo due to accelerated plasma clearance (9). In this work, we sought to achieve greater ADC potency and homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates by stably conjugating MMAE via a hydrophilic PEGylated glucuronide linker system. The glucuronide linker system represents a hydrophilic alternative to the val-cit dipeptide, and exploits lysosomal b-glucuronidase (10) to initiate drug release. The glucuronide linker has been used to mitigate aggregation issues with lipophilic payloads like minor groove binders (11) and camptothecins (12). Glucuronide-MMAE linker 2 was found to provide ADCs at 4-drugs/Ab with in vitro and in vivo properties similar to val-cit-MMAE linker 1 conjugates (13). More recently, we have shown that incorporation of a PEG 24 solubilizing moiety in a side chain configuration (drug-linker 3), but not as a tether between the maleimide and drug, enabled ADCs loaded at 8-drugs/Ab with greater plasma exposure and improved in vivo performance relative to non-PEGylated drug-linker 2 controls (6)",

We present a highly efficient phosphonamidate-based conjugation handle that combines a discrete hydrophilic PEG-substituent, an established linker-payload and a cysteine-selective electrophile in one compact building block. This reactive entity provides homogeneous ADCs with a high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8 in a one-pot reduction and alkylation protocol from non-engineered antibodies. The compact branched PEG-architecture introduces hydrophilicity without increasing the distance between antibody and payload, allowing the generation of the first homogeneous DAR 8 ADC from VC-PAB-MMAE without increased in vivo clearance rates. This high DAR ADC exhibits excellent in vivo stability and increased antitumor activity in tumour xenograft models relative to the established FDA approved VC-PAB-MMAE ADC Adcetris, clearly showing the benefit of the phosphonamidate based building-blocks as a general tool for the efficient and stable antibody-based delivery of highly hydrophobic linker-payload systems.",

In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period.

These glycoproteins present an insufficient clinical activity themselves and ADCs emerged to empower their antiproliferative effect [75,76]. Thereby, such conjugates are produced with the objective of selectively ablating cancer cells by combining the action of a highly potent cytotoxic compound with antibody specificity for a target antigen, with these two compounds being conjugated through a linker [24,75]. In this way, after binding it, the ADC-antigen complex is internalized and transported to cellular organelles (generally lysosomes) where the release of the attached drug can take place [75]. To improve its therapeutic activity without compromising safety, ADCs must limit the exposure of normal tissues to the transported drugs and only deliver the payload to the tumor cells that express the chosen antigen [75,76]. For this reason, linker technologies that ensure an adequate stability of the drug in ADCs are required so that the drug release does not occur in circulation [76]. Besides, the method employed in ADC conjugation conditions the drug loading stoichiometry and homogeneity and determines its anti-tumor activity, efficacy, and tolerability [76,77]. \n\nFor such conjugations, at the beginning of ADC development, acid-labile hydrazone linkers that can be cleaved in the acid environment of endosomes and thus allow the release of the ADC payload in these organelles were selected. However, disulfide-based linkers demonstrated later to be a better choice because they were more stable at a physiological pH, and nowadays they are normally preferred to anchor cytotoxic compounds to antibodies [75].",

A(P)DCs have three major components, antibody (targeting protein), linker and payload, the cytotoxic drug. Recently, advances in identifying targets, selecting highly specific mAbs of preferred isotypes, optimizing linker technology and improving chemical methods for conjugation have led to the approval of two ADCs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more than 30 ADCs in advanced clinical development. However, the complex and heterogeneous nature of A(P)DCs often cause poor solubility, instability, aggregation and eventually unwanted toxicity. This article reviews the main components of A(P)DCs, and discusses the choices for drugs, linkers and conjugation methods currently used. Future work will need to focus on developments and strategies for overcoming such major problems associated with the A(P)DCs.",

ADCs combine the cell-killing potency of a toxic drug with the target selectivity of an antibody towards overexpressed receptors on cancer cell membranes. Their relevance is demonstrated by two FDA-approved ADCs already in the market, brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u2122) and trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla\u2122), and over 40 ADCs undergoing clinical trials. 1,2 7][8] Maleimide conjugation to cysteines of an interstrand reduced IgG1 exploits the lower abundance of solvent accessible disul\ue103des to reduce heterogeneity. This is exploited in the synthesis of Adcetris\u2122 by \ue103rst reducing the solvent accessible disul\ue103des in the antibody, followed by conjugation to a maleimide-functionalised drug-linker construct. 9 1][12][13][14] The existence of high drug to antibody ratio (DAR) species has been recognised to lead to physical instability, faster clearance and lower therapeutic index, highlighting the need to carefully control drug loading during ADC synthesis. 8,10,11,15 ][18] The linker joining the drug to the conjugation site must be stable in circulation and enable drug release following internalisation into the target cell, with the linker stability being recognised as a major challenge.

            "text": "The conventional processes to conjugate linker-drugs to antibodies (lysine conjugation or conjugation to cysteines derived from reduction of inert-chain disulfide bonds) produces ADCs with heterogeneous mixtures of multiple species with different drug loads: DAR of 0-8 (10). \n\nEach of these DAR species could potentially have distinct PK properties and activities (28,38). While in vitro potency could increase with increase in drug load per antibody, it does not always follow that in vivo efficacy and safety profiles will also improve (28). Hambelet et al. (28), made ADCs with an anti-CD30 antibody (cAC10) conjugated to MMAE with the MC-vc-PAB linker with either two, four, or eight drugs per antibody. ADCs with lower drug loads (DAR of 2 or 4) had slower clearance values, longer half-lives and were better tolerated in mice compared to an ADC with a higher drug load (DAR of 8). In addition, the DAR4 ADC showed equivalent in vivo antitumor activity to the DAR8 ADC at equal antibody doses despite having half the amount of MMAE. Similar results were seen in a rat study with trastuzumab-MCvc-PAB-MMAF conjugates (DAR of 2, 4, and 6), where the ADCS with the higher drug loads cleared faster and were less tolerated compared to conjugates with lower drug loads (39). \n\nThe next generation ADC efforts have focused on eliminating this heterogeneity by using site-specific conjugation methods to produce a more homogenous ADC to improve stability, PK, and therapeutic index, as shown in several recent studies (17,29,40,41). These conjugation strategies include the use of engineered cysteines, unnatural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation through glucotransfersases and transglutaminases (10). A recent study at Genentech using site-specific conjugation with engineered cysteines (THIOMAB\u2122 technology) showed that chemical and structure dynamic of the conjugation site can influence the stability of the ADC (17).",

            "text": "We have improved antibody conjugate stability by employing a sulfone linker for site-specific modification rather than  conventional maleimide chemistry. Labeling of engineered Cys and Sec residues in anti-HER2 THIOMABs and an anti-ROR1 SELENOMAB, respectively, was achieved using a phenyloxadiazole sulfone fluorescein compound. 21 Neither chemoselective conjugation nor antigen binding was impaired with the sulfone linker. Studies utilizing cytotoxic payloads will be essential for validating the use of sulfone linkers in preparing ADCs. Conjugation of cytotoxic agents increases the local hydrophobic character at the site(s) of labeling which can lead to aggregation, particularly for ADCs with high drug-toantibody ratios. 36,37 However, ADCs site-specifically labeled at engineered cysteine residues have shown much improved physical stability. 13 The stability of antibody conjugates was also evaluated in human plasma. In general, LC-V205C conjugates were more stable compared to Fc-S396C conjugates. However, the Fc-S396C sulfone conjugate was much more stable than the corresponding maleimide conjugate. We suspect that further enhancements in stability are possible via conjugation at sites with intermediate conjugate stability, such as HC-A114C. Moreover, the kinetics of sulfone labeling can be exploited to generate conjugates with expanded valency, which may prove to be valuable in gaining selective tumor targeting, increased internalization, or more potent cytotoxicity. These results indicate that sulfone linker chemistry provides a new synthetic route for developing antibody conjugates with improved serum stability.\n\n\u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Experimental procedures; comparison of THIOMAB labeling using phenyloxadiazole, benzothiazole, and phenyltetrazole fluorescein-linked compounds; flow cytometry histogram of the dose-dependence for HER2 antigen binding by trastuzumab on BT-474 cells; trastuzumab and THIOMAB conjugate binding to HER2-Fc by ELISA;",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) typically consist of monoclonal antibodies covalently bound to cytotoxic drugs or noncytotoxic payloads via a chemical linker. 1,2 Combining the specific targeting capabilities of a monoclonal antibody with the cancer-killing ability of a cytotoxic drug allows ADCs to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue and potentially widens the therapeutic window by reducing toxicities. 3,4 sing a site-specific conjugation strategy, homogeneous ADCs with a defined drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) can be produced by reaction at engineered cysteine residues at specific sites in antibodies without disruption of interchain disulfide bonds. ADCs with site-specific conjugation, which are also called THIOMAB TM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs), have demonstrated an improved therapeutic index in preclinical settings. 5,6 In order to further improve the therapeutic window, a new generation of conjugates that incorporates different linkers and cytotoxic agents is being developed to improve the safety and efficacy profiles. 8][9] This is especially important for drug conjugates such as ADCs and TDCs, which contain linker-drugs that may be susceptible to chemical or enzymatic modifications (e.g., enzyme hydrolysis). 10 rug conjugates bring the payload to the site of the tumor via the circulatory system. To be efficacious, they must retain the drug in circulation long enough to reach the targeted cell, internalize, and release the drug inside the cell to induce cell death. Therefore, understanding the stability of both the linker and drug is valuable when identifying factors for rational conjugate design. As we explore and evaluate different sites of attachment of the linker-drugs to the antibody, various linkers and a variety of drugs with alternative mechanisms of action, the ability to better predict in vivo stability in a timely manner becomes crucial. 2][13][14] Plasma stability has been shown to play an important role in the discovery and development of both small and large molecule drugs. 15,16",

Some rat antibodies showed additional conjugation sites in the light or heavy chain besides Q295 resulting in a higher conjugation ratio (Table 1). \n\nADCs are a highly interesting class of therapeutics for the selective delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells. We thus investigated the flexibility of our peptide linkers to generate ADCs with different and well-defined drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) and also, if different payloads could be coupled using a combination of bio-orthogonal chemistries in a simple manner. Recent data suggest that co-delivering multiple payloads with an antibody may overcome tumor drug resistance. [29,30] Based on peptide 1 and its excellent conjugation efficiency, we designed different linker structures that allow attachment of two of the same payloads using strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) or two different payloads by combining SPAAC and maleimide-thiol coupling through incorporating a cysteine residue into the linker (Figure 2A, structures 2-5). As payloads we chose the highly potent cytotoxic payloads Maytansine 6 (similarly to the FDA-approved ADC T-DM1) and \u03b1-Amanitin 8 as well as the metal chelator NODAGA 7 (Figure 2A). Native trastuzumab could be readily and completely functionalized within 20 h with the azido-containing peptide 2 RAK\u00c0 K(N 3 ), resulting in the antibody-linker conjugate ALC1 (Figure 2B and 2C).

            "text": "Chemotherapy is one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment. Chemotherapy is often associated with a low therapeutic window due to its poor specificity towards tumor cells/tissues. Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology may provide a potentially new therapeutic solution for cancer treatment. ADC technology uses an antibody-mediated delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the tumors in a targeted manner, while sparing normal cells. Such a targeted approach can improve the tumor-to-normal tissue selectivity and specificity in chemotherapy. Considering its importance in cancer treatment, we aim to review recent efforts for the design and development of ADCs. ADCs are mainly composed of an antibody, a cytotoxic payload, and a linker, which can offer selectivity against tumors, anti-cancer activity, and stability in systemic circulation. Therefore, we have reviewed recent updates and principal considerations behind ADC designs, which are not only based on the identification of target antigen, cytotoxic drug, and linker, but also on the drug-linker chemistry and conjugation site at the antibody. Our review focuses on site-specific conjugation methods for producing homogenous ADCs with constant drug-antibody ratio (DAR) in order to tackle several drawbacks that exists in conventional conjugation methods.",

            "text": "Regarding the proportion of conjugation sites, although the degree of ionization of different peptides is different, this is only a relative proportion. According to the statistical analysis of 27 sites, four batches of T-DM1 drug candidates have consistent conjugation ratios, except for slight differences in the conjugation ratios at one site, their conjugation ratios of the remaining sites are consistent, and the consistent chemical stability of the interbatch conjugation sites was also demonstrated in the thermal stability studies. Unconjugated linkers are the main side-reaction products during the conjugation process. For four batches of ADCs, the percentage of coupled linkers ranges from 4.3 to 5.1%. We identified four forms of unconjugated linkers, and in particular, the two forms of crosslinks that would affect the advanced structure of drug molecules. The above information shows that under the strict control of the conjugation process, each lysine site results in the same conjugation ratio and the same side reaction level, and the interbatch consistency of ADCs can be ensured. \n\nOver time, for all lysine-linked ADC conjugation sites, the identification of lys residues as conjugation sites for small molecules increased from 47 to 90%. Thus, we believe that, unlike the traditional concept, the attachment of small molecules may be distributed over all lys residues, and the ratio of solvent exposure at each site is directly related to the efficiency of the site conjugation and shedding rate. With the development of mass spectrometry techniques, it is possible to identify small fractional conjugations at all lys sites. ADCs are an emerging technology relative to antibody drugs. However, more efforts and time are needed to overcome technical barriers. Only when industry and regulators learn from each other, a more effective platform process can be developed and applied in parallel with the regulatory framework.",

Site-selective disul\ue103de bridging with small molecules \ue103ts these requirements. 4][35][36][37] Godwin and co-workers have also pioneered bis-sulfones as reagents for disul\ue103de bridging and ADC synthesis. 17,38 ecently, we have shown the use of NGMs for ADC synthesis, 30 and have shown the ADCs to have good selectivity towards creating DAR 4 conjugates and to have stability in blood serum, as well as in vitro potency. 26 NGMs require stabilisation against thiol scavenging conditions by hydrolysing to maleamic acid conjugates under basic pH. 25,26,28 PD-conjugates on the other hand are stable to hydrolysis, less reactive in thiol scavenging conditions and also stable against retro Michael. Thus, PDs do not require any additional modi\ue103cation beyond conjugation to deliver stable ADCs; although (prior to this communication) they were only shown to be stable in blood plasma mimicking conditions. 37 In addition, PDs have been shown to be amenable to forming 2-in-1 reagents for both disul\ue103de reduction and stapling to reduce ADC heterogeneity as well as to be amenable to making controlled DAR 2 ADCs. 34 The PD scaffold has also been shown to incorporate dual click handles, which enables controlled modi\ue103cation of each PD bridged disul\ue103de with two distinct agents. 37 However, to date, there has been no in vivo data on PD conjugates and no serum stability or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) analysis. \n\nHerein, we demonstrate the synthesis and evaluation of PDbased ADCs with an industry relevant drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a therapeutic modality that aims to improve payload delivery specificity and reduce systemic toxicity. Considering the complex structure of ADCs, various bioanalytical methods by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ligand binding assay (LBA) and hybrid LBA-LC-MS approaches have been established for ADC characterization and quantification. LCMS-based assays enable drug-antibody ratio (DAR) sensitive quantification of the conjugated payload. Typically, for quantitative, DAR-sensitive, assessment by LC-MS/MS,the conjugated payload is enzymatically liberated and quantified. Despite recent advances in ADC bioanalytical methods, the DAR-sensitive quantification of noncleavable linker ADCs by LC-MS/MS remains challenging. Thus, we developed a novel digestion-free middle-down mass spectrometry (DF-MDMS) using a collision-induced dissociation approach for absolute quantification of conjugated payload from four different ADCs in a biological matrix with minimum sample preparation. These results demonstrate that ADCs with different linker-payload structures can be quantified, including a noncleavable linker ADC, trastuzumab emtansine. It also shows that the assay sensitivity is comparable to the conventional ADC quantification method by linker-payload cleavage using enzyme, while the assay dynamic range depends on factors including payload ionization and dissociation efficiency, DAR and its distribution, and species abundance. By demonstrating absolute quantification of both cleavable and noncleavable linker ADCs, this novel middle-down ADC approach demonstrates its potential application in bioanalysis and analytical characterization, especially for early discovery where high-throughput screening is required as the new approach saves time and resources by not requiring enzymatic digestion for cleavable ADCs or development of anti-payload antibodies for noncleavable linker ADCs.",

With the development of ADCs, a series of linkers had already been exploited. The linker that connects a cytotoxic drug to a ligand should be relatively stable in circulation to limit the damage caused to healthy tissues by highly active agents before they are delivered to the target site. Once the chemically conjugated targeted drug is internalized, however, the linker should facilitate efficient drug release. Based on the chemical structure and properties of the conjugated drug, three types of linkers can be selected: chemically labile linkers, enzyme-labile linkers and non-cleavable linkers.",

The majority of ADCs follow a similar mode of action that involves antibody mediated receptor binding, ADC internalization, and subsequent payload release and execution of cytotoxicity (Figure 1). The success of ADCs relies on several critical factors: 1) target antigens (e.g., CD30, HER2, CD22, CD33 CD79b, Nectin 4, trophoblast-cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), CD19), 2) type of antibody (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, nanobody, bispecific antibody), 3) type of payload (e.g., monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), DM4, calicheamicin, DM1, monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF)), 4) type of linker (e.g., valine-citrulline, Sulfo-SPDB, hydrazone linker), 5) conjugation platform (e.g., lysine-, cysteine-, and site-specific conjugation), 6) target indications (e.g., breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, urothelial cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer).

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

This drug-linker format is used in three FDA-approved ADCs: brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) and enfortumab vedotin (Padcev); all having an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of ~ 4 3,18 . For drug conjugation to the ON, we applied a thiol-conjugation technology previously developed in our group, which is based on selective and irreversible thiol tagging with 3-arylpropiolonitriles (APN) [19][20][21][22] . Thus, a thiol-modified 37-mer ON was conjugated to APN-VC-MMAE to afford a conjugate cON-MMAE which was purified by HPLC in good yield. Remarkably, this drug payload was completely soluble in water at micromolar range and was at least 138 times more soluble than APN-VC-MMAE (see SI, APN-VC-MMAE synthesis), thus demonstrating the applicability of DNA linker to increase the solubility of hydrophobic drugs. cON-MMAE was used to anneal with AOC T-ON-Cy5 to yield ADC T-DNA-MMAE, which was then purified by gel filtration chromatography to remove excess of DNA payload. To compare this ADC to classical covalently linked ADC, T-MMAE was prepared with an average DAR of 1.9 by reacting T-N 3 with BCN-VC-MMAE (Fig. 2A).",

In particular, linker design plays a critical role in modulating ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency in the tumors, which thus affects ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads. We also propose to conduct dose fractionation studies to gain guidance for optimal dosing regimens of ADCs in pre-clinical models.",

Prodrugs are inactive or less active derivatives of drug molecules and undergo enzymatic or chemical transformation to regenerate the active forms. ADCs are designed to be superior to either antibody therapeutics or chemotherapy alone by overcoming their limitations while preserving the merits from both. The antibody connected to the cytotoxic warhead (drug) via a linker serves as targeted delivery system to the tumor expressing the antigen/target recognized by the antibody. Ideally, in blood, after systemic administration, this prodrug is nontoxic. Upon binding of the antibody to the targeted tumor antigen and internalization of the complex into the cancer cell, the drug is then released in its active form and in sufficient quantity to kill the cell. On top of the careful choice of a target/antigen expressed in specific tumor indication, it requires finding the best combination between the antibody, the linker, and the drug, which, besides its own characteristics and constraints, are linked and impact each other (Bander, 2013).\n\nThe combination of nanoparticles and antibodies can offer versatility together with specificity ( Fig. 25.4), allowing a huge potential market.",

(2016) discovered a self-immolating disulfide linker (b-mercaptoethyl-carbamate, -SCH2CH2OCO-) that can be directly attached to cysteine thiols of antibodies with cysteine residues engineered into IgG light or heavy chains (called THIOMAB) (Junutula et al., 2008(Junutula et al., , 2010;;Shen et al., 2012).This linker can protect a cytotoxin from early release to circulation but could release a cytotoxin in tumors in a right form to a proper concentration.",

There is probably no universal conjugate-linkage strategy optimal for all antibody-drug conjugates. It is necessary that each pair of antibody/drug be optimized to obtain the best therapeutic outcome. New linkers can be designed to improve water solubility (e.g. PEGylation) and tumor selectivity (e.g. enzymatic-cleavable, photocleavable, proton cleavable) [72]. This will substantially reduce the heterogeneity of ADCs and toxicity. Based on current development of the ADCs using DNA-damaging agents, we summarize that the ideal properties for a linker are as follows: (1) stable during circulation and (2) cleavable after binding to the target or internalization.",

Among such biomolecule conjugates, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) need a linker that provides a stable linkage between cytotoxic drugs and antibodies, whilst conjugating in a biologically benign, fast and selective fashion. This review focuses on how the development of novel organic synthesis can solve the problems of traditional linker technology. The review shall introduce and analyse the current developments in the modification of native amino acids on peptides or proteins and their applicability to ADC linker. Thereafter, the review shall discuss in detail each endogenous amino acid's intrinsic reactivity and selectivity aspects, and address the research effort to construct an ADC using each conjugation method.",

            "text": "Unique challenges exist when formulating an ADC compared to a naked mAb. As detailed earlier, sample complexity plays a major role in making formulation of a non-site-specific ADC exceptionally difficult due to the diverse array of post conjugation species. In addition, the drugs that are attached to ADCs and the linker by which the drug is attached also instill added complexity to formulate an ADC [65,66]. The drugs associated with ADCs often have less than desirable aqueous solubility characteristics themselves. These drugs have the propensity to cause inter-antibody aggregation through either exposure of protected aggregation-prone regions within the antibody backbone upon conjugation or through drug-drug mediated interactions [67][68][69]. This greatly limits longitudinal stability as well as high concentration formulation capabilities. The drugs that are conjugated to form ADCs are also not the same from ADC to ADC making generalizable formulation protocols difficult to establish [3,4]. \n\nThe means by which the drugs are attached to the antibody is also a unique hurdle that needs special attention when considering formulation of an ADC compared to a naked mAb. Linkers vary in chemical composition providing the ADC with differing cleavable capabilities. Cleavable linkers fall into two primary categories that allow for cleavage either enzymatic digestion or exposure to pH extremes [70][71][72][73][74][75][76]. There is an ever growing list of linker chemistries with distinctive capabilities that are being tested in diverse ADC applications [77]. These desirable delivery characteristics subsequently make the drug and linker susceptible to premature degradation and cleavage during storage which limits the potential formulation compositions considerably when compared to that of formulation of a naked mAb [75,78]. Depending upon the selected linker and the method of conjugation of the linker to the antibody, critical antibody characteristics that directly affect solubility, including surface charge and zeta-potential, can be negatively impacted. For these reasons, drug, linker composition and antibody target are all critical components specifically selected to address the unique demands of the intended therapeutic application and unfortunately result in significantly more complex formulation demands.",

In recent years, booming research pipelines together with various FDA approved ADCs, such as moxetumomab pasudotox, polatuzumab vedotin and famtrastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki, implicate that this drug delivery platform can be used for next-generation of oncotherapy. 65,66 Among the three components of ADCs, the linker chemistries determine the therapeutic window. Successful linker technology should prevent the premature release of the toxic payload in bloodstream and at the meantime ensure that the free toxic payload is released at the intended disease site at an adequate rate. Therefore, tremendous effort has been invested in the conjugation and linker chemistries in ADC \ue103eld. 65 Based on different mechanisms for release of the toxic payload, the linker strategies fall into two main classes: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. Disul\ue103de bond within the linker, due to its relative stability in circulation and efficient free drug release rate at tumor site, is one of the most recognized and attractive strategies for cleavable linkers in ADC design, along with hydrazone.

            "text": "In conclusion, the field of anticancer therapeutics has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with a particular focus on the development of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) as a promising approach. These ADCs consist of a three-component structure: an antibody that selectively binds to a target antigen, a highly potent drug (payload) that induces targeted cell death, and a linker that connects the antibody to the drug. This combination offers several advantages, including high target specificity, prolonged half-life in the body, and reduced side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. \n\nThe evolution of ADCs can be categorized into three generations, each addressing specific limitations and challenges. First-generation ADCs faced issues related to drug binding sites on antibodies, efficiency, and side effects. Second-generation ADCs employed advanced techniques, such as controlling the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and selective conjugation of drugs to specific antibody sites, to enhance their efficacy and safety. The latest third-generation ADCs aim for uniform drug binding to antibodies without compromising antigen-antibody binding. \n\nThe growth of ADCs aligns with the rising prominence of biopharmaceuticals in the pharmaceutical market, with anticancer drugs projected to dominate global drug consumption. In particular, the ADC market is expected to expand significantly, reaching multi-billion-dollar figures. The recent surge in ADCs candidates and approvals reflects the growing interest and investment in this therapeutic approach. \n\nResearch efforts have predominantly focused on targeting antigens like HER2 and EGFR, showing promise in various cancers. Clinical studies have further demonstrated the potential of ADCs, with a substantial number of trials in progress, particularly for HER2-targeted ADCs. The choice of linkers and payloads in ADCs design plays a critical role in their stability and efficacy, with Val-Cit linkers and microtubule polymerization inhibitors being common choices. \n\nIn summary, Antibody-Drug Conjugates represent a rapidly evolving and promising avenue in the field of anticancer therapeutics. As research continues to uncover novel targets, linkers, and drug payloads, the potential for ADCs to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes remains high. The future of anticancer therapeutics is undeniably intertwined with the continued growth and innovation of ADCs.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have gained substantial attention due to their potential for targeted delivery of cytotoxins to cancer cells. This approach minimizes systemic toxicity, enhances therapeutic efficacy, and ultimately broadens the therapeutic index. 5][6] Second-generation ADCs, inspired by THIOMAB\u2122, feature precise control over the location and number of payloads, demonstrating an improved therapeutic index in preclinical studies. 7,8 4][15][16] Various emerging single-agent conjugate modalities, including bispecific ADCs, probodydrug conjugates, immune-stimulating ADCs, and proteindegrader ADCs have been reviewed as next-generation ADC platforms to tackle these challenges. 17,18 Several excellent reviews have outlined the rationale for combining different classes of cytotoxic compounds and immune-activating molecules and other compounds targeting diverse signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. 19,20 In contrast to combining chemotherapies or a single-payload ADC with chemotherapy, or the combination of two single-payload ADCs, a dual-payload ADC leverages two payloads with distinct mechanisms of action (MOA) to target tumor cells simultaneously, enhancing therapeutic efficacy by overcoming drug resistance mechanisms and activating immune response 17,18,[21][22][23][24][25] (Figure 1). This review examines various reported methodologies for achieving site-specific dualpayload conjugation, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach in terms of flexibility for achieving different drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) of individual and two combined payloads. It also discusses process development complexities and the potential advantages of dual-payload ADCs. \n\nHomogeneous dual-payload conjugation has been exemplified by the introduction of additional orthogonal chemistry through linker design or combinations of orthogonal, sitespecific, single-payload conjugation methods. The methods for creating homogeneous dual-payload ADCs can be divided into three classes, as shown in Figure 1, based on the methods of introduction of orthogonality.",

The resulting ADCs are shown in  In the second step of the two-step conjugation method, the antibody-linker conjugates were reacted with a maleimide payload. We chose AZ13601508 (AZ-1508), a tubulysin warhead and maleimide-based linker for demonstrating the proof of concept (Figure 3) [17]. Our antibody-linker conjugates carry multiple diene units designed to conjugate maleimide payloads via the Diels-Alder reaction at a broad pH rage [16]. Antibody-linker conjugates were incubated with AZ-1508 payload to convert them into ADCs. As maleimides at high concentrations have a propensity to target hinge disulfides of an antibody at elevated pH (pH \u2265 7.2), and to prevent their hydrolysis, the conjugation of the payload with antibody-linker conjugates was performed at lower pH (pH~6.0). Antibody conjugates of the D4, D6 and D8 linkers used 8, 12 and 16 equivalents of AZ-1508, respectively, to complete the reaction in 3 h. Purification of the conjugation mixture was performed by CHT and the poled fraction was determined to be over 95% monomer by size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Information). Conjugation efficiency of the CHT-purified ADCs was determined to be greater than 95% by LC-MS. The results also showed addition of AZ-1508 on the heavy chain, while the light chain remained unaffected (detailed protein mass spectrum available in the Supplementary Information). No difference in rate or conjugation efficiencies for the reaction between antibody-linker conjugates and AZ-1508 was detected.",

For example, in trodelvy, used in a treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, the linker may release the drug prior to internalization. (3) Payload: The payload may be a subunit used in cellular tracking, imaging, or most commonly toxic drug therapeutics. The overall goal of ADCs is to deliver the payload directly to target cells via the antibody without affecting normal, healthy tissue. \n\nImportantly, the use of antibodies in modern medicine is not restricted solely to ADCs and cancer therapy. For example, mABs now find routine use in the context of radionuclide (PET) imaging agents, informing therapeutic decision-making [6,7]. \n\nAntibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, antibody-enzyme conjugates, antibody-polymer conjugates, antibody-nanomaterial conjugates, antibody-catalyst conjugates, and antibodies involved in protein degradation also play critical roles in biomedical research and therapies [2]. \n\nIn whatever capacity, the use of antibodies applied to medicine is critically dependent on the ability to anchor them to operative payloads in a highly precise manner [8][9][10]. Many researchers are tackling the challenge of new strategies for chemoselective synthetic modifications of biomolecules, including antibodies [11]. In the case of ADCs, conjugation of the linker/payload to the antibody must not drastically alter the pharmacokinetics or physicochemical properties of the antibody [12,13]. Typically, zero to eight payloads are attached to the antibody. Heterogeneous ADCs may thus be a mix of both unconjugated and \"overloaded\" antibodies. Unconjugated antibodies compete with antibodies containing payloads for binding, which can diminish the effectiveness of the antibodypayload materials. On the other hand, excessive loading of the antibody can lead to antibody aggregation, increased toxicity, decreased stability, and/or a shorter ADC half-life [14]. Optimization of the drug/antibody ratio (DAR) and payload distribution/location thus becomes significant for ideal ADC design.",

Thus, new antibody formats are being engineered, site-specific linkers are being designed, and highly toxic molecules, like RNA polymerase inhibitors, are starting to be used for conjugation. These molecules were previously considered extremely toxic and could not be used as chemothera- peutic drugs. In this review, we will present an overview of current cancer treatments and their limitations, and the logic that has led to the generation of ADCs. Their mechanism of action will be outlined, and the most recent novelties in linker design and optimization will be discussed, along with present and near future discoveries in the current ADC research pipeline.",

            "text": "Various conjugation chemistries have been developed for small molecule drug attachment to antibodies, predominantly to recombinantly expressed human IgG1s. Early ADCs, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg \u00ae ), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae ) and Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa \u00ae ), used non-site-specific attachment strategies, specifically amine reactive succinimidyl esters (NHS esters), which can react with solvent exposed lysine side chains. This approach enables conjugation to antibodies without requiring engineering or disruption of their native structures. This strategy results in a heterogeneous mixture of antibody conjugated with varying amounts of drug, with the reported drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) being an average of the different species. This method not only creates heterogeneity in the ADCs with regard to the number of drugs conjugated per antibody, but also with the location of those drugs, as a standard IgG1 contains approximately 20 solvent exposed lysines [28].\n\nAll other approved ADCs utilize interchain disulfides (four for an IgG1) for conjugation using thiol-reactive maleimide containing linkers. While not truly site-specific, conjugation to these cysteines results in a dramatic improvement in conjugate homogeneity over lysine conjugation strategies. A standard IgG1 antibody can accommodate up to eight conventional maleimide linker-drugs. While the calculated DAR is still an average of differently loaded species, the limited number of possible conjugation sites limits the drug load distribution.\n\nConjugation to the interchain disulfides of the antibody is accomplished after limited reduction with an excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine or dithiothreitol. Maleimides can then react with these free thiols through a Michael addition forming a thiosuccinimide. This reaction is quick, specific, and can proceed at pH values as low as 5 and as high as 8, making it amenable to a wide range of antibody formulations [29]. Similar to lysine",

            "text": "The linker drug molecule preferentially attaches to lysines on the heavy chain. The same lysine conjugation as well as drug and linker moieties is used in the other ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) targeting CD33 which was approved in 2000 by FDA but voluntarily withdrawn in 2010. Both inotuzumab ozogamincin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin use a hydrazone linker connecting through the cytotoxic drug N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin to the antibody, in which the hydrazone is first cleaved in the acidic intracellular environment followed by the reduction of disulfide bridge in the calicheamicin [63]. Overall, in the case of conjugation through lysine residue, the cytotoxic drug attachment to the antibody typically occurs at a relatively very few \u03b5-amino groups of any of the ~80 lysine residues present in the antibody, because the preferential surface accessibility for the lysine side chains to chemical modification is limited. ADCs with the DAR value of more than certain value, for example more than five, are usually hydrophobic and can lead to solubility problem. Currently, the widely used chemical method for lysine conjugation involves the formation of a stable amide bond using activated ester of the drug molecules, and several methods for the preparation of ADCs through lysine conjugation were described [64]. \n\nTherefore, both conjugation methods described above are useful and resulting in several ADCs, two of which were approved by the FDA and others are in late clinical development. However, the complexity of ADCs often leads to heterogeneous distribution of drug molecules conjugated to antibodies and unfavorable physicochemical properties including increased aggregation with higher number of DARs, poor aqueous solubility and low stability in circulation.",

The greatest advantage Linkers are classified according to different categories in terms of the mechanism of drug release and their stability in circulation, including cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers [32,42]. Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease. The optimal linkers designed to conjugate the cytotoxic drugs to monoclonal antibodies must meet the particular requirements imposed by the factors described above.",

            "text": "The ligation of a linker bearing a cytotoxic drug to a mAb is an essential step in the construction of ADCs. Early strategies to establish this conjugation involved the direct functionalization of abundant solvent-accessible Lys residues using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester derivatives. 4][15] For these reasons, the construction of chemically-de\ue103ned conjugates has emerged as a key goal of ADC design, leading to the development of methodologies that enable the site-selective chemical modi\ue103cation of mAb. In one example, Junutula and co-workers demonstrated that an ADC labelled non-speci\ue103cally at Lys residues resulted in a lower efficacy when compared to the same mAb labelled site-selectively at an engineered Cys (as indicated by a greater reduction in tumour volume). 9 ys is now the primary residue target to achieve site-selective conjugation of drugs to mAbs, due to low Cys abundance and the enhanced nucleophilicity of its sul\ue098ydryl side chain. 16 Such methods o\ue09den rely on the engineering of additional free Cys by site-directed mutagenesis and/or reduction of existing disul\ue103de bridges and their further use for conjugation. 17 Nevertheless, alternative approaches for the construction of homogeneous conjugates are now being pursued, namely the chemical modi\ue103cation of non-canonical amino acids genetically introduced into the mAb's structure. 12 Finally, full-length IgG mAbs display a glycan at the conserved asparagine (Asn) 297 residue in the CH2 domain. A number of glycoengineeringbased strategies have also been pursued for the attachment of drugs to the antibody through this motif. 12 No matter the method of chemical modi\ue103cation, the conjugation of the linkerdrug moiety to the mAb should proceed rapidly under mild conditions (neutral pH, buffered solution, room temperature) and lead to the formation of a homogenous ADC while retaining the structural integrity and antigen binding capacity of the mAb. \n\nIn the sections below, we review strategies that have been used to conjugate drugs to mAbs and highlight technologies that may \ue103nd utility in the generation of homogenous and plasma stable ADCs in the future.",

Preventing deconjugation in the circulation reduces off-target toxicity and increases delivery of the drug to the tumor. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been explored, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

            "text": "linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5). Indeed, the only marketed ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has an acid-cleavable linker (28). We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that, indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release as well as differing properties of the metabolites.\n\nAlthough cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the same target can sometimes",

The success of the platform is attested by the upwards of 80 ADCs currently in clinical trials, 1,3 and the eight ADCs that have been granted marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration-the most recent being sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy\u00ae, Immunomedics) in April 2020 for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Notwithstanding, many of the commonly adopted approaches to antibody conjugation have significant limitations. Common methods of attachment involve nucleophilic conjugation through multiple lysine or cysteine residues (generated by reduction of interchain disulfide bonds). Such stochastic modification strategies predominantly produce heterogeneous mixtures of conjugated antibody products, which accordingly suffer from unpredictable and inconsistent pharmacological profiles. [4][5][6] Other approaches to attaining homogeneous constructs have been developed, such as the incorporation of engineered cysteine residues, unnatural amino acids, enzymatic modification, chemical linchpins, and affinity peptides-however may involve additional complexity. [7][8][9][10] Site-selective disulfide rebridging has emerged as an alternative strategy towards the production of homogeneous ADCs. 11 This method involves reduction of the interchain disulfides, followed by treatment with a linker which crosslinks the reactive thiols from the reduced disulfides, thus reforming the covalent bridge between the protein chains. Significant progress has been made in recent years in the development of disulfide rebridging linkers, with the toolbox of available reagents now including bissulfones, 12 next generation maleimides, [13][14][15][16] and pyridazinediones.

This approach utilizes sequential unmasking of cysteine residues with orthogonal protection to enable site\u2010specific conjugation of each drug. In addition, because the approach utilizes conjugation to native antibody cysteine residues, it is widely applicable and enables high drug loading for improved ADC potency. To highlight the benefits of ADC dual drug delivery, this strategy was applied to the preparation of ADCs containing two classes of auristatin drug\u2010linkers that have differing physiochemical properties and exert complementary anti\u2010cancer activities. Dual\u2010auristatin ADCs imparted activity in cell line and xenograft models that are refractory to ADCs comprised of the individual auristatin components. This work presents a facile method for construction of potent dual\u2010drug ADCs and demonstrates how delivery of multiple cytotoxic warheads can lead to improved ADC activities. Lastly, we anticipate that the conditions utilized herein for orthogonal cysteine unmasking are not restricted to ADCs and can be broadly utilized for site\u2010specific protein modification.",

Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are complex biopharmaceuticals produced by chemically attaching a highly-active small molecule drug (payload) via an appropriate linker to an antibody or antibody fragment [1][2][3][4] (Fig. 1). The antibodies used in ADCs typically possess high affinity and specificity for antigens preferentially expressed on tumor cells compared to regular tissues and direct the attached payloads to the tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. While attached to the antibody, cytotoxic payloads behave as inactive prodrugs while in circulation and display their activity when liberated from their antibody or linker. To date, nine ADCs have been approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are in clinical development 5) (Table 1). \n\nTraditionally, ADCs are synthesized through stochastic payload conjugation onto natural amino acid residues, usually lysine or reduced interchain cysteine residues, via chemically stable linkers. These conjugation approaches lead to ADCs with varying levels of heterogeneity that may be limited in their efficacy and therapeutic index due to this heterogeneity. 6) ith the rapid growth of the ADC field in recent years, analytical characterization to measure drug-antibody ratio (DAR) continues to play an important role in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of ADCs. 7) Regulatory bodies such as FDA and European Medicines Agency require the biopharmaceutical industry to analyze antibody-small molecule bioconjugates similarly to both large-molecule and small-molecule drugs, and the complex nature of ADCs require well-thought analytical strategies. 8,9) Although many analytical chemists have reported unique methodologies in the scientific literature that are geared toward the establishment of a gold standard technique for DAR characterization, challenges remain because of the structural complexity, diversity and heterogeneity of ADCs. 7,10) In addition to heterogeneity due to conjugation methodology as described above, there is antibody-related issue to be considered. Naked antibodies, starting material of ADCs, are usually produced as complex mixtures of Fc glycoforms.",

Anti-CD30 and anti-CD19 antibodies, cAC10 and hBU12, respectively, were conjugated as previously described (17). Briefly, a solution of antibody around 10 mg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmol/L EDTA was treated with 12 equivalents of tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to achieve full reduction of the four interchain disulfides. Reduction progress was monitored by reversed-phase chromatography and additional TCEP was added as needed to complete the reaction. Upon reaction completion, the reduced antibody solution was purified by three rounds of 10-fold dilution and centrifugation at 4,000 \u00c2 g through a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filter.\n\nFully reduced antibody as a PBS solution containing 1 mmol/L EDTA and buffered with 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate to pH 7.4 was conjugated with 10 molar equivalents (25% excess) of drug-linker as a 10 mmol/L DMSO stock. The resulting solution was vortexed and left at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. The extent of conjugation was assessed by reversed-phase chromatography and additional drug-linker was added as needed. Once all eight available mAb cysteines were alkylated, the crude ADC solution was purified by three rounds of 10-fold dilution with PBS and centrifugation at 4,000 \u00c2 g through a 30-kDa MWCO filter. The extent of aggregation was assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and in all cases, monomeric ADCs were obtained with less than 2% aggregation. The SEC chromatograms revealed a shift to shorter retention times as the PEG length in the drug-linker increased, indicative of an increase in apparent ADC size ( Supplementary Fig. S1). The resulting DAR MC-PEG 24 n = 1, n = 0, 8 homogeneous ADCs were sterile-filtered through a 0.22-mm centrifugal filter and stored at \u00c080 C.",

            "text": "As discussed in the sections above, considerable advancements in next generation ADCs are anticipated to further explore both the chemical and biological design elements for ADCs. This includes, but is not limited to, antibody engineering to facilitate direct site-specific conjugation, modification of conjugation chemistry and introduction of novel linker compositions to confer enhanced stability, as well as, the exploration of additional existing and novel chemical entities/modalities as conjugates to increase the pharmacological applications of ADCs. Many of these advancements to design better molecules are intricately interdependent with optimizing or improving the ADME drug-ability properties of ADCs, such as linker-payload stability, distribution, and pharmacokinetics (PK). This is because defining the exposure-response relationship for both safety and efficacy has been intimately tied with ADC peripheral PK, target tissue or site of action concentration and the disposition of the payload at the intended site. The criticality of understanding the exposure-response relationship and therapeutic index (TI) for ADCs is exemplified by Mylotarg \u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) which is composed of a CD33 mAb linked to the cytotoxic drug calicheamicin via an acid-liable hydrazine linker. While initially approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2000, it was pulled from the market at the request of regulatory agencies in 2010 due to safety concerns and the failure to reproduce the clinical benefit connected to linker stability in AML patients. Following additional interrogation of exposure-response relationships, examining alternative lower dosing and scheduling, Mylotarg found a path back to the market and received a new FDA approval for newly diagnosed CD-33 positive acute AML patients in 2017. \n\nDissecting the ADME properties of ADCs is a complex endeavor given the unique properties of each component within the molecules. ADC ADME involves delineating the intertwined properties of linker-payload stability, pharmacokinetics, clearance, metabolism, and disposition of mAb, conjugate (i.e., small molecule chemical entity for traditional ADCs), as well as, the ADC entity itself.",

As anticipated by the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of monoclonal antibody drugs [4,5], where high-affinity mAb binding to cell membrane proteins enables the localization of a substantial fraction of mAb to the targeted cell populations, the chemical conjugation of the payload to the anti-cancer mAb increases the selectivity of the delivery of the payload to the cancer cells, and thereby increases the therapeutic index of the payload [6].",

            "text": "The chemical linker is a critical component of the ADC that joins the mAb and the cytotoxic payload. The linker facilitates ADC stability in circulation until the ADC reaches the target cell and the payload is released. 143 There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. 144 Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. 145 This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

Decreases in platelet counts were observed 5 days post-dosing in the group given anti-CD22-SPP-DM1 and 12 days post-dosing in the group given anti-CD22-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE ( Fig. 5B; Table S1). In contrast, the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, MCC-DM1 and MC-MMAF, caused no significant hematologic effects compared with the control group, suggesting that they are much better tolerated than ADCs with cleavable linkers. All other clinical pathology variables (see Materials and Methods) in the ADC-dosed groups were no different from the vehicle-dosed control group.\n\nPharmacokinetics of cleavable and uncleavable linker ADCs. We hypothesized that the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 and anti-CD22-MC-MMAF, were better tolerated because they released smaller amounts of free drug or small molecule metabolites. Another possible reason is that the uncleavable linker ADCs were cleared faster resulting in less exposure to the ADC and metabolites. To test these ideas, we performed pharmacokinetic assays on the four ADCs, measuring total antibody (which includes both the ADC and the unconjugated antibody) and drug-conjugated antibody. We found that the total antibody clearance was similar for both cleavable and uncleavable conjugates, suggesting that the type of linker has a minimal effect on the metabolism of the antibody (Fig. 5C and D). However, whereas the (drug-loaded) uncleavable linker conjugates cleared with similar kinetics as the total antibody, the cleavable linker conjugates lost drug more quickly, particularly SPP-DM1. This suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (",

            "text": "The most commonly used methods for tethering mAb to a payload and linker are based on chemical and enzymatic conjugation. Traditionally, ADCs (e. g., Mylotarg, Cadcyla and Adcetris) were constructed by utilizing accessible amino acid residues (e. g., lysine or cysteine) on antibodies for controlled chemical conjugation with activated linker moieties. [14] However, these strategies generated heterogeneous ADC species with variable antibody-drug ratios (DARs) and conjugation sites, which can lead to reduced efficacy. In addition, ADCs with high DAR can result in a decrease in potency, risk of aggregation, reduced half-life, and premature systemic release of payload. [15] Nevertheless, these limitations were overcome by the insertion of non-natural amino acids through genetic engineering. [16] Enzymatic conjugation strategies have been used to install a unique handle on native or engineered mAb that allows sitespecific conjugation to the payload. For example, bacterial transglutaminase is an enzyme that catalyzes the acyl transfer reaction between specific glutamine (Q295) [17] within the antibody and the linker containing primary amine at one end, resulting in the generation of ADC with a defined DAR of 2, and a DAR of 4 can be reached with N297Q. [18] The N-glycan at N297 in the Fc-domain of antibody provides another attractive site for payload conjugation without the need for genetic engineering. [19] For example, the core fucose, galactose, or sialic acid residues on N-glycan have been modified with the desired tag for site-specific conjugation of payloads. [20] Our development of homogeneous antibodies with in vitro glycoengineering allows us to develop a robust approach for site-specific conjugation of payload to the Fc-glycan of antibody. [21]",

            "text": "Among the studies of drug conjugates and cancer therapeutics, the use of antibodies has been attracting widespread interest due to its active targeting activity along with ready availability and cost-effective production [89]. Monoclonal antibody (mAb), as the targeting agent, offers several distinct advantages compared to other conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as great selectivity and long half-life [1]. Its application dates back to 1997, when the first mAb, rituximab, attained approval. Since then, there are currently more than 20 approved monoclonal antibodies available for various therapeutic use [90]. \n\nOne of the most promising applications, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), the original concept of the magic bullet, has already evolved through three generations, with 7 ADCs approved in the market, and around 70 ADCs are on clinical trial [13,91,92]. The first generation of ADC utilizes acid-labile linkers such as carbonate and hydrazone bonds. The examples of this generation ADC in the market are Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (Mylotarg \u00ae ) and Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (Besponsa \u00ae ) [93]. However, Mylotarg was withdrawn from the market in 2010, mainly due to the instability of hydrazone linkers, which offers no significant benefits to outweigh the other toxic effects such as infusion reactions, pulmonary and hepatoxicity [91]. Mylotarg also suffered from its low chemical, manufacturing, and control (CMC) properties, as well as low drug to antibody ratio (DAR). Other first-generation ADC, such as BR96-doxorubicin and KS1/4-methotrexate utilizing non-cleavable linker, did not show promising data, with potency lower than their free drug counterparts [1,91].",

The development of new ADC formats to enable site-selective antibody modi\ue103cation, including the incorporation of engineered cysteine residues 13 and unnatural amino acids 22,23 into the antibody sequence and the use of various enzymatic processes, [24][25][26] have produced ADCs with precise DAR and de\ue103ned attachment points. While effective, these methods are complicated and generally inefficient. 27 Recently, disul\ue103de-bridging linkers have emerged for ADC production: a bis-reactive linker moiety undergoes reaction with both thiol residues derived from a reduced cysteine disul\ue103de bond, leading to covalent re-bridging of the protein. Such linkers are capable of generating ADCs with more precise DAR and drug distribution as well as reforming covalent bonds between the antibody chains. Signi\ue103cant progress has been made in the \ue103eld with this class of linker by Baker, Caddick and Chudasama and their co-workers, amongst others. [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] Despite these impressive advances, new methods are still required for the production of stable and homogeneous ADCs from nonengineered antibodies. We sought to develop a new disul\ue103de bridging linker platform, which generated highly stable ADCs with precise DAR and drug distribution. Vinylpyridines have previously been used to modify proteins via cysteine conjugation. 37 Glythera has recently developed a monovinylpyridinebased linker platform for ADC construction with such conjugates demonstrating excellent stability (Fig. 1a). We envisaged that divinyl-functionalised hetero-aryl linkers could be used to achieve cysteine re-bridging, generating inherently stable constructs whilst also achieving precise control of DAR and siteof-attachment with native antibodies.\n\nHerein, we report upon our investigations in this area and development of a novel divin",

The heterogeneity inherent to ADCs not produced site-specifically may not only be detrimental to the quality of the drug but also is less-desirable from the perspective of regulatory science. An ideal method or unified approach used to measure the DAR for ADCs, a critical aspect of their analysis and characterization, has not yet been established in the ADC field and remains an often-challenging issue for bioanalytical chemists.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of therapeutic treatments. The combination of a selective antibody and cytotoxic payload in the form of an ADC has been hailed as a \"magic bullet\" given their promise to dramatically improve treatments [1,2]. While a variety of different modalities, including site-specific ADCs, are under development and in clinical trials, all ADCs that have received FDA approval fall into the categories of either cysteine-or lysine-linked ADCs [3]. The use of either reduced cysteines or solvent-accessible lysine residues as conjugation sites adds heterogeneity to the antibodies, increasing the challenges of characterization. Recent advances in mass spectrometry techniques have resulted in enhanced structural characterization of ADCs as well as improved differentiation of positional isomers with middle-down techniques [4,5]. However, the translation of these methods to lysine-linked ADCs has been limited. \n\nThe complexity of an ADC and the difficulty associated with its characterization arises largely from the modality of the payload-to-antibody linkage. The least complex cases are site-specific or next-generation ADCs, which utilize modified amino acid residues, typically on the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the heavy chain (HC), to link the payload to a small number (two or four) of specific amino acids [6]. Cysteine-linked ADCs typically contain an average of four payloads attached to interchain disulfide bonds, resulting in eight possible conjugation sites per ADC [6]. Finally, lysine-linked ADCs are derived from linker conjugation to random lysine residues along the entire amino acid sequence of the antibody [6]. The large number of lysine residues on antibodies, typically around 90 in total, increases the challenge of characterizing lysine-linked ADCs. \n\nDespite the challenges, significant strides have been made to improve the characterization of ADCs.",

Consisting of antibodies conjugated to small drug molecules through a variety of linkers, ADCs are chemically complex analytes. Here we present a unique experimental comparison of four techniques for ADC analysis: hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC-UV/Vis), reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS), using either a QToF or an Orbitrap analyser, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Four different ADCs consisting of Trastuzumab, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and a peptidic linker moiety differing in their respective stoichiometric ratios in regard to drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) were used for the comparison. We found that the determined DAR from all techniques was comparable, while the accuracy of the molecular weights for the conjugated light and heavy chain differed more extensively. This indicates that the choice of a mass analyser is more crucial for determining the accurate weights of the light and heavy chains than to evaluate the DAR of a given batch. However, ambiguous DAR assignment in HIC-UV/Vis or bias for either the light or heavy chain fragments in the mass spectrometry-based techniques can influence the obtained average DAR value and the use of complementary techniques is advisable. Out of the four techniques evaluated, HIC-UV/Vis and MALDI required less time to obtain an average DAR value and would therefore be good for initial screenings in the early stages of the discovery phase of new ADCs.",

            "text": "In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates have become valuable assets in the field of molecularly targeted medicine. Antibody-drug conjugates are complex biological entities that combine a surface receptor-targeting antibody with a cytotoxic chemical [24]. This reduces the adverse effects on healthy cells/tissue that expresses minimal or no levels of the targeted antigen and enables the targeted distribution and internalization of a toxic payload by tumor cells that express the antigens targeted by the ADC (Fig. 2) [25]. Additionally, the chemical structure of the linker imparts distinct qualities to the various ADCs [24,25]. Antigen-depleting drugs featuring noncleavable thioether linkers necessitate internalization and degradation by lysosomes to exhibit their antitumor properties without causing harm to adjacent antigennegative cells [25]. In contrast, ADCs including cleavable linkers have the potential to discharge a portion of their lethal payload into the tumor microenvironment, resulting in the death of antigen-positive target cells as well as adjacent antigen-negative cells through the bystander effect. A multitude of tumor-antigens that are differently expressed in ovarian cancers are amenable to this innovative approach [26]. ADCs consist of three constituent elements: a synthetic chemical linker, a cytotoxic payload, and an antibody. Each component of an ADC contributes to a distinct characteristic, namely tumor selectivity, cytotoxicity, and biodistribution. The selection and formulation of individual components are critical in determining the therapeutic efficacy of an ADC.",

This article aimed to describe three new methods for ADC synthesis, and it came out that all these three methods have high quality and can be used as a common technology to produce ADC. Also, the safety of ADC and several examples of clinical use for ADC were introduced. It provides a reference for ADC synthesis in a relatively simple chemical process for future research.

            "text": "ABSTRACT Antibody-drug conjugation strategies are continuously evolving as researchers work to improve the safety and efficacy of the molecules. However, as a part of process and product development, confirmation of the resulting innovative structures requires new, specialized mass spectrometry (MS) approaches and methods, as compared to those already established for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and the heightened characterization practices used for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in order to accurately elucidate the resulting conjugate forms, which can sometimes have labile chemical bonds and more extreme chemical properties like hydrophobic patches. Here, we discuss practical approaches for characterization of ADCs using new methodologies and ultrahigh-resolution MS, and provide specific examples of these approaches. Denaturing conditions of typical liquid chromatography (LC)/MS analyses impede the successful detection of intact, 4-chain ADCs generated via cysteine site-directed chemistry approaches where hinge region disulfide bonds are partially reduced. However, this class of ADCs is detected intact reliably under non-denaturing size-exclusion chromatography/MS conditions, also referred to as native MS. For ADCs with acid labile linkers such as one used for conjugation of calicheamicin, careful selection of mobile phase composition is critical to the retention of intact linker-payload during LC/MS analysis. Increasing the pH of the mobile phase prevented cleavage of a labile bond in the linker moiety, and resulted in retention of the intact linker-payload. In-source fragmentation also was observed with typical electrospray ionization (ESI) source parameters during intact ADC mass analysis for a particular surface-accessible linker-payload moiety conjugated to the heavy chain C-terminal tag, LLQGA (via transglutaminase chemistry). Optimization of additional ESI source parameters such as cone voltages, gas pressures and ion transfer parameters led to minimal fragmentation and optimal sensitivity. Ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) MS, combined with reversed phase-ultrahigh performance (RP-UHP)LC and use of the FabRICATOR\u00ae enzyme, provides a highly resolving, antibody subunit-domain mapping method that allows rapid confirmation of integrity and the extent of conjugation.

            "text": "In addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].",

From the clinical trials of ADCs, application of available lysines or reduced cysteine disulfides to form the conjugates is the predominant approach. The lysine and cysteine as the natural amino acids exist in the antibodies with different contents and are treated with diverse methods to prepare ADCs, including heterogeneous ADCs and homogeneous ADCs [87]. The heterogeneous ADCs were generally synthesized by utilizing the thiol groups from reduction of cystines and primary amino group of lysines directly. However, the heterogeneity of ADCs resulted in pharmacokinetic limitations. Comparing with heterogeneous ADCs, homogeneous ADCs through antibody engineering and other techniques to provide the specific sites are more stable and have better activities in vivo [86,88,89]. \n\nGenerally, lysines with free amines are more prevalent than cysteines with disulfides and are less uniformly distributed in the antibody. The primary amine in the lysines easily reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters incorporated into the drug-linker to form stable amide and a great number of commercial linkers depend on this method (Figure 14) [55,90]. Meanwhile, the amine of lysine also was applied to make an amidine with a pendant thiol for connection to a linker or payload via 2-imiothiolane (Traut's reagent). \n\nGenerally, lysines with free amines are more prevalent than cysteines with disulfides and are less uniformly distributed in the antibody.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) seek to combine the exquisite specificity of an antibody to its cognate antigen with the cytotoxic potency of the drug payload. Advances in ADC technology have paved the way for two FDA-approved ADCs: CD30targeted brentuximab vedotin for relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and ALCL (1), and HER2-targeted ado-trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-expressing breast cancer (2). There are many design factors crucial to the development of effective ADCs (3)(4)(5), and plasma pharmacokinetics has emerged as an important parameter on ADC pharmacology (6).\n\nPayload conjugation to antibodies can impart significant hydrophobicity to the resulting conjugate, which can lead to ADC aggregation and/or accelerated plasma clearance in vivo, often limiting the drug-to-antibody ratio. As a consequence, the majority of ADCs in clinical development are loaded with an average of only 2 to 4 drugs per antibody (7). This limitation is due not only to the intrinsically hydrophobic character of the cytotoxic agent used as the drug payload, such as the antimitotic monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) in Fig. 1, but also to the linker technology employed to ensure the release of the drug in a chemically unmodified form. For example, self-immolative cleavable linker systems like the valine-citrulline (val-cit) dipeptide (drug-linker 1) and glucuronides (drug-linkers 2-10) rely on a [1,6]-fragmentation across a hydrophobic aryl spacer to achieve drug release, adding additional hydrophobicity to the conjugate. Recently, we reported that a DAR 8 ADC prepared with the hydrophobic drug-linker val-cit-monomethylauristatin F was taken up by Kupffer cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, likely contributing to the accelerated plasma clearance in rats (6). This uptake was greatly diminished when",

            "text": "Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

            "text": "Optimising conjugation chemistry is critical in improving ADC efficacy. Chemical conjugation and enzymatic conjugation are the two main traditional stochastic methods used to bind antibodies to their payloads [20]. Chemical conjugation involves a reaction between amino acid residues on the antibody and a reaction site on the linker [20]. Examples of chemical conjugation methods include lysine amide coupling (used in T-DM1), and cysteine coupling, where the payload is bound to lysine or cysteine residues on the antibody, respectively [20]. These methods typically generate heterogeneous ADC species with variable DARs, which are as suboptimal as ADCs with broad DAR distributions and are less efficacious than those with narrow DAR distributions [20,26]. For instance, on a typical antibody, there are approximately 10 chemically accessible lysine residues; hence, lysine coupling can lead to variable ADC species with a broad DAR distribution [27]. Cysteinebased coupling involves a reaction between reduced interchain cysteine residues on the antibody and thiol groups on the payload, and is superior to lysine coupling, as the number of conjugation sites is more limited, generating ADCs with more homogeneous DARs [20]. \n\nAnother key limitation of traditional coupling methods is that the site of the payload attachment to the antibody is stochastically distributed [28]. This stochastic distribution leads to unpredictable pharmacokinetic effects, as for example, binding of the payload to sites on the antibody that participate in antigen binding can substantially alter the pharmacokinetics and biological activity of the ADC [28]. In vitro assays and pharmacokinetic analyses in xenograft models have introduced cysteine conjugation at various antibody positions and compared this to enzymatic conjugation using microbial transglutaminase on the light chain or heavy chain [29]. ADCs produced using enzymatic conjugation to the light chain or position Q295 on the antibody had superior pharmacokinetic behaviour, as did those engineered with cystine conjugation to the L328 position [29].",

In order to attach the potent anticancer drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to Tmab, they reduced the antibody native interchain disulfide-bonds with tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP). Next, they performed a functional re-bridging with either an NGM or a PD molecule and conjugated NGM-MMAE and PD-MMAE to Tmab, obtaining efficient ADCs [84,85]. In addition, in an anterior study these authors followed the same strategy with NGMs to synthesize a Tmab-ADC with loaded doxorubicin, anticipating that the NGM platform could have considerable utility for the development of ADCs [86]. \n\nAt last, Shen et al. also built Tmab-ADCs loaded with MMAE but, to assess the impact of the conjugation site, they engineered cysteines at three different Tmab sites, differing in solvent accessibility and local charge. Once obtained, they attached MMAE to them through maleimide chemistry with a maleimido-caproyl-valine-citruline-p-amino-benzyloxy carbonyl (MC-vc-PAB) linker, and showed not only the linker choice conditions ADC biological activity, but also the conjugation site [77]. \n\nSince, in some studies, it has been shown that the location of attached compounds is not as relevant as their stoichiometry and that heavily loaded conjugates are quickly removed from the circulation, recombinant methods have begun to acquire more importance in this nanotechnology field [24,76].",

In this review, we summarized the methods that are currently used to design and synthesize antibody-drug conjugates, including heterogeneous ADCs and homogeneous ADCs, via various functional groups such as thiols, amines, alcohols, aldehydes and azides.

The coupling activity of MTGase was applied to synthesize antibody-drug conjugates [83][84][85]. For example, Dennler et al. [83] afforded a highly homogeneous trastuzumab-MMAE conjugate with DAR of 2 using this enzymatic conjugation strategy. In this work, an azide-containing linker, which involves a primary amine, was coupled to Q295 of the deglycosylated antibody by MTGase. This enzymatic reaction was followed by a SPAAC reaction with the DBCO-containing auristatin drug. \n\nCell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system was also efficiently applied to produce monoclonal antibodies that contain unnatural amino acids for antibody-drug conjugate generations.",

To date, eight ADCs that have been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg, Pfizer, Inc.), brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris, Seattle Genetics, Inc.), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, Genentech, Inc.), inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa, Pfizer, Inc.), polatuzumab vedotin-piiq (Polivy, Genentech, Inc.), enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (Padcev, Seattle Genetics, Inc.), trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.) and sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy, Immunomedics, Inc.) and more than 100 in active clinical trials [1]. \n\nThough antibodies in ADCs rarely have antitumor activities by themselves, their specificity to target antigens often makes them useful delivery vehicles of payloads targeting tumor cells [2]. The toxic payloads used in most approved and clinical-stage ADCs are microtubule disruptors (e.g., maytansinoid and dolastatin analogs) or DNA-damaging agents (e.g., duocarmycins, pyrrolobenzodiazepines, and calicheamicins). The conjugating linkers in ADCs are generally classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones, which behave quite differently in a biological system, and produce distinct in vivo forms of released toxin.",

The linkers of antibody-drug conjugates profoundly impact their potency and safety. Recently, a variety of methods have been developed to conjugate drugs to antibodies. In this review, we summarized the methods that are currently used to design and synthesize antibody-drug conjugates, including heterogeneous ADCs and homogeneous ADCs, via various functional groups such as thiols, amines, alcohols, aldehydes and azides. Heterogeneous ADCs were usually synthesized through the thiols of cysteine residues and the amines of lysines, however, the heterogeneity diminished their activities and promoted antibody aggregations, and increased toxicities in the circulation. Homogeneous ADCs made through the catalysis of site-specific conjugation enzymes such as AGT, BTG, aaRS and Sial T are more stable and have comparable or even better activities than those conventional analogs in vivo. We believe that a growing number of methods will be developed to synthesize ADCs in the near future, and more and more ADCs, especially site-specifically modified ADCs, will be produced.",

Finally, we applied conjugation conditions optimized in earlier work (pH 5.5, 4\u00b0C), 24,25 resulting in 95% conversion with only 2.5 equiv of BCN-lissamine per reactive Tyr residue (5 equiv per antibody), and completion of the reaction overnight.\n\nAfter these promising results, we were keen to explore the suitability of the PNGase F-enabled tyrosinase-mediated click reaction for direct conjugation of cytotoxic linker-drugs to an antibody Fc-domain as a novel approach to conveniently generate functionalized ADCs. To this end, a range of linker\u2212 payload constructs was synthesized (Scheme 1) by covalent attachment of cytotoxic payloads PBD dimer (5) or MMAE (6 and 7) to BCN derivatives 4a via a Val-Cit-PABC cleavable linker (shown in red) or to 4b via Val-Ala-PABC. Notably, in each case we also inserted a carbamoyl-sulfamide unit (shown in green), a highly polar linker from medicinal chemistry programs and marketed as HydraSpace technology, 39 in order to impart better solubility to the BCN-linker-drugs and to improve the putative therapeutic window. In addition, for MMAE we prepared both a linear linker-drug bearing one payload (6) as well as a linker-drug with a branching unit and two payloads (7), in order to generate the respective ADCs with drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2 or 4, respectively. Next, each linker-drug 5\u22127 was individually conjugated to deglycosylated trastuzumab in the presence of mushroom tyrosinase, thereby providing the desired ADCs in each case with >90% efficiency, resulting in the clean formation of DAR2 or DAR4 ADCs as illustrated by MS, HIC, and HPLC analysis (SI Figures S9\u2212S14).

            "text": "The linker of an ADC simultaneously serves several purposes. An important one is to physically join the antibody and small-molecule payload with a stable linkage that persists during ADC circulation in the bloodstream. Furthermore, the chemical ligation of linker to payload must be achieved without compromising biological potency. In this regard, the payload's structure (and any known structure-activity relationship [SAR] information) will dictate which reactive chemical groups may be used for ligation. Primary and secondary amines are most commonly accessed. Reactions using alternate functional groups are rare, either because they are difficult to achieve or because the resulting products are unstable. Two interesting papers from 2016 described significant progress towards broader functional group accessibility. Staben et al. [47] developed a chemoselective ligation approach that targets tertiary and heteroaryl amines coupled through a so-called ''traceless'' cleavable linker. After proteolytic cleavage of the linker, an adjacent self-immolating unit cyclizes upon itself and releases the payload in an unmodified form. An additional benefit of the ligation approach is that the quaternary amine produced from the reaction offers added solubility to the overall construct. This is a very desirable feature and is particularly useful when ligating hydrophobic payloads, such as those often found in ADCs. Kolakowski et al. [48] created a self-immolating linker (methylene alkoxy carbamate [MAC]) that can attach to alcoholic payloads. The authors coupled the MAC unit with a b-glucuronidasepromoted release system, allowing for payload liberation upon ADC internalization. ADCs made using this linker system were stable over 7 days in mouse plasma and were highly efficacious in a mouse xenograft model. \n\nPayloads that lose biological potency when the core chemical structure is modified require the use of traceless linkers. These systems comprise a cleavage event (the trigger) followed by the self-immolation event that releases the free payload. The kinetics of both cleavage and immolation can vary according to the structure of the linker/payload.",

This combination leverages the precise targeting capabilities of antibodies with the potent cell-killing effects of drugs to effectively eliminate cancer cells. The antibody component binds to speci\ue103c antigens on tumor cells, facilitating targeted drug delivery. As a result, ADCs offer the therapeutic bene\ue103ts of chemotherapy while reducing systemic toxicity. 28 DCs have emerged as a hotspot in cancer drug development. Since the FDA's approval of Mylotarg\u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) in 2000, 14 ADCs have received market authorization globally. Currently, more than 100 ADC candidates are undergoing clinical trials. These novel anti-cancer therapeutics, o\ue09den referred to as \"biological missiles,\" are ushering in a new era of targeted cancer treatment. 29 atansever and colleagues 28 explored the creation of new ADCs using a CuAAC reaction between a metal-chelating azide attached to the drug and an alkyne integrated into the antibody (Fig. 6). They reported that the metal-chelating azide incorporated into the antibody requires speci\ue103c reaction conditions, potentially leading to increased heterogeneity in the synthesized ADCs. Such heterogeneity can result in reduced activity and possible toxicity. In contrast, alkyne-incorporated antibodies do not have this limitation and are more accessible and cost-effective to produce. To validate their hypothesis, the researchers used Pertuzumab as a model antibody. They reduced it and then incorporated alkyne and 2-azidopyridine linked to the cytotoxic payload. The payload-antibody linkage was efficiently achieved under the standard click reaction conditions and the entire ADC synthesis process furnished excellent yield in short time, con\ue103rming that the CuAAC reaction is suitable for rapid and efficient ADC production. 28,30 atansever et al. 31 illustrated the bene\ue103ts of combining an antibody alkyne with a metal-chelating drug azide by developing a catch-and-release synthesis method, 31 as depicted in Fig. 7.",

A ligand that already contains a payload can attach to the antibody and noncovalently self-assemble on specific, conserved amino acid residues in the antibody to form the ADC. This strategy is also a homogeneous preparation method that can be enacted quickly and increase plasma stability of the ADC (Gupta et al., 2019).\n\nAntibody-oligonucleotide drug conjugates are a new type of ADC derivative, for example trastuzumab-DNA-MMAE (Dovgan et al., 2020). In these conjugates, an oligonucleotide-linked payload and an oligonucleotide-linked antibody can combine to form an antibody-DNA-drug conjugate in a short time and under mild conditions based on hybridization of the oligonucleotides (Dovgan et al., 2020). The presence of the oligonucleotide in antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates can also improve water solubility and decrease precipitation in blood.\n\nSeveral homogeneous preparation methods have been developed, but most only produce ADCs with a DAR of two (Kumar et al., 2020). Higher DAR approaches may improve therapeutic efficacy. One branched linker strategy can supply a DAR of four, six, or eight. The linkers in this series were connected to antibody cysteine residues by a sulfhydryl-specific iodoacetyl linkage and carried payloads linked by cyclic diene through the Diels-Alder reaction (Kumar et al., 2020). Additionally, another strategy involves the incorporation of unAAs containing dienes into the antibody. This allows for Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions, providing a rapid and convenient method for homogeneous ADC preparation (St Amant et al., 2018). One example of this strategy incorporates an unAA containing a spiro ( [2.4]hepta-4,6-diene structure) or a cyclopropene derivative into the antibody. These antibodies could be coupled with a dihydropyridazine linker-payload via the Diels-Alder reaction in quantitative one-step reactions (Oller-Salvia et al., 2018;St Amant et al.,",

These two components are joined by a covalent linker, whose nature is critical to the efficacy and safety of the ADC. Enzyme-cleavable dipeptidic linkers have emerged as a particularly effective ADC linker type due to their ability to selectively release the payload in the lysosomes of target cells. However, these linkers have a number of drawbacks, including instability in rodent plasma and their inherently high hydrophobicity. Here we show that arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers are cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes to tracelessly release their payload, while circumventing the instability problems associated with dipeptide-linkers. When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers.",

As a  result of linker-drug conjugation to an antibody, not only do the common degradation pathways of antibodies remain, the added moieties bring more degradation pathways and instability. 92 For example, the partial reduction step prior to Cys-based conjugation may change the quaternary structure and binding properties of IgG1 antibodies. 93 The hinge-region cysteine of IgG1 may racemize during storage. 94 In addition, the lysine activation step introduces a risk of cross-linking of the activated species. 83 The conjugation step to link a hydrophobic drug molecule to largely hydrophilic surface patches of an antibody often requires addition of significant amounts of organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) to maintain solubility of the hydrophobic drug and linker. Under these conditions, antibody may aggregate severely, resulting in significant reductions in yield. For example, the conjugation step for Mylotarg requires up to 20% DMF, which causes up to 50% aggregate formation measured by SEC. 95 This can be alleviated to a certain extent by additives such as glycerol, propylene glycol, and octanoic acid, which have been shown to attenuate the aggregation propensity and permit the use of lower DMF concentrations during conjugation reactions. 92 Generally speaking, as the DAR increases, the propensity to form aggregates increases, and it is more pronounced in higher ionic strength solutions. 86,96 Reported results also suggest that partial unfolding of the CH2 and hinge regions of antibody caused by conjugation is responsible for aggregate formation. 85 The increased hydrophobicity imparted by higher DARs may negatively affect in vivo performance of ADCs due to the higher propensity to aggregate or other structural destabilization effects, as reported in a recent study by Lyon et al. showing that the efficacy of auristatin ADCs can be improved by using more hydrophilic linker design or attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. 96 The moieties added in an ADC via the drug and linker may introduce more liability to light-",

The general mechanism of action for an antibody-DM1 conjugate is binding of the ADC to its target antigen followed by internalization of antigen-ADC complex and subsequent degradation of ADC in lysosomes. Subsequently, the active metabolite Lyslinker-DM1 is released from lysosomes and then binds to microtubules preventing polymerization and leading to mitotic arrest (2,18). Maytansinoid conjugates containing either cleavable (reducible disulfide bonds, SPP and SPDB) or noncleavable (nonreducible thioether, MCC) linkers are currently being tested in the clinic. Although ADCs with reducible linkers show tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models on a broad range of tumor targets, ADCs with nonreducible MCC linker showed activity with only tumor targets that have rapid internalization properties (10,13). In addition, ADCs with nonreducible linkers exhibit significantly less antigenindependent toxicity in rat safety evaluation studies compared with an ADC with a reducible SPP linker. The improved safety profile observed with the nonreducible linker ADCs may be due to a decreased release of free drug or toxic catabolites into circulation, which is manifested by a longer in vivo half-life observed with the MCC-DM1 conjugates compared with the SPP-DM1 conjugates in mice (10,13). The TMAb-mcc-DM1 ADC with a nonreducible MCC linker was chosen as the clinical candidate based on both its improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics, and its reduced toxicity over the reduciblelinker form of trastuzumab ADC (10).\n\nWe recently reported a THIOMAB technology platform that produces a more homogeneous preparation of antibody drug conjugates (19).

            "text": "Efficacy of ADCs depends on each of these elements and their specific features [7]. mAbs incorporated in ADCs are mainly based on the igG1 isotype because of its higher immunogenic properties and easier production if compared to the other igG2 and igG4 subtypes [8]; the drug to antibody ratio (DAR) is usually between 2 and 8. \n\nLinkers affect all pharmacokinetic properties of ADCs and can be cleavable or noncleavable; non-cleavable linkers are more stable and are cleaved only by the complete proteolytic degradation of the ADC in lysosomes [9]. Instead, cleavable linkers release the payload in response to tumor-associated factors, such as acid pH (acid-labile linkers), reduction-oxidation conditions (disulfide-linkers), abundance of proteolytic enzymes (protease-cleavable linkers), allowing the diffusion of the payload through neighbouring cells not expressing the target (bystander effect) [10]. \n\nLastly, payloads derive from DNA-damaging agents (duocarmazine), antimicrotubule compounds (mertansine, vedotin, amberstatin) or topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, govitecan), and are characterized by an extremely unfavourable therapeutic index, if administered systemically as free drugs [8]. \n\nTrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first ADC approved in solid tumors in 2013 [11], in particular, in patients with HER2-positive mBC [12], according to the OS benefit demonstrated in a clinical trial enrolling patients progressing on trastuzumab and chemotherapy; it is an ADC targeting HER2, conjugated through a non-cleavable linker to an anti-microtubule compound (mertansine or DM1), with a DAR of 3.5 and it is characterized by a multiple mechanism of action, from the selective deliver of the payload to HER2 signalling inhibition and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by trastuzumab [13,14].",

            "text": "Despite recent technological advances in quantifying antibody drug conjugate (ADC) species, such as total antibody, conjugated antibody, conjugated drug, and payload drug in circulation, the correlation of their exposures with the efficacy of ADC outcomes in vivo remains challenging. Here, the chemical structures and concentrations of intratumor catabolites were investigated to better understand the drivers of ADC in vivo efficacy. Anti-CD22 disulfide-linked pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD-dimer) conjugates containing methyl- and cyclobutyl-substituted disulfide linkers exhibited strong efficacy in a WSU-DLCL2 xenograft mouse model, whereas an ADC derived from a cyclopropyl linker was inactive. Total ADC antibody concentrations and drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) in circulation were similar between the cyclobutyl-containing ADC and the cyclopropyl-containing ADC; however, the former afforded the release of the PBD-dimer payload in the tumor, but the latter only generated a nonimmolating thiol-containing catabolite that did not bind to DNA. These results suggest that intratumor catabolite analysis rather than systemic pharmacokinetic analysis may be used to better explain and predict ADC in vivo efficacy. These are good examples to demonstrate that the chemical nature and concentration of intratumor catabolites depend on the linker type used for drug conjugation, and the potency of the released drug moiety ultimately determines the ADC in vivo efficacy.",

            "text": "Zhao et al. have incorporated sulfonate-or PEG-containing hydrophilic linkers into antibody maytansinoid conjugates to achieve high DAR without aggregation and low non-specificity [132]. Lyon et al. have exploited a hydrophilic glucuronide linker in PEGylated ADCs to decrease the hydrophobicity of ADC and to extend its in vivo half-life [133]. \n\nThe one-pot chemical conjugation of mAb and drug reactants usually produces heterogeneous ADC products. In the case of thiol-maleimide chemistry, the extent to which the inter-chain disulfide bonds were reduced determined the quantity of drugs attaching to mAb, which led to the ADC species with different DARs ranging from 0 to 8. DAR constitutes a major concern for designing ADC therapeutics, since DAR tightly impacts the aggregation propensity, in vivo potency and serum stability of ADC. ADC with high DAR usually has higher aggregation propensity due to the increased hydrophobicity conferred by the hydrophobic drug molecules. Guo et al. have found that their ADC with DAR6 species may exist in a multimeric state, while DAR2 and DAR4 species likely exist in monomeric forms under ambient conditions [127]. Beckley et al. have reported that their ADC aggregate mainly contained the high DAR species of 6-8 [124]. Meanwhile, ADC with high DAR was reported to be subjected to more structural perturbations, causing the destabilization of mAb, as exampled by Adem et al. showing that high DAR species readily experienced aggregation and fragmentation under stress conditions, such as high ionic strength buffer, due to the fewer inter-chain disulfide bonds [134]. The destabilized structure of high DAR species could probably reconcile its fast plasma clearance [133] when encountered with protease degradation. Besides, Pan et al. have reported that ADC bears distinct conformation at the C H 2-C H 3 interface compared to the parent antibody [135], which may disturb its interaction with FcRn and impact the serum half-life of ADC.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies targeting antigens found on tumor cells have elicited much interest as cancer therapeutics, but have historically shown moderate single-agent activity. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are hybrid biotherapeutics that combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with potently cytotoxic small molecules. 1,2 4][5] Properly designed, ADCs retain the binding activity of the parent antibodyand thus any inherent anti-tumor activityand add to it the cell-killing activity of the conjugated small molecules. The chemical linkage between antibody and small molecule is intended to remain intact while the ADC is circulating, with release only after receptor-mediated endocytosis and catabolism of the antibody. \n\nA widely used and clinically proven ADC format utilizes thiol-functionalized maytansinoids as the effector molecules. 4,6,7 Maytansinoids DM1 and DM4 (Fig. 1A) embody the desired attributes of ADC effectors: high cytotoxic potency, facile conjugation to antibody, and favorable biophysical properties of antibody conjugates incorporating them. They are linked to antibodies via heterobifunctional crosslinkers that form thioether or disulfide linkages to the maytansinoid and amide linkages to solvent-exposed lysine residues on the antibody. 8 Fig. 1A) Contemporary discovery of ADCs proceeds from identification of a molecular target to the generation of a panel of antibodies against it by suitable in vivo or in vitro methods. 9 Such antibodies must then be screened for activity in the appropriate ADC format. Key attributes for the antibody portion of an ADC are less well-understood than for the effector, but they include specificity for target, high expression yield, and compatibility with the conjugation chemistry and effector molecule of choice. In addition, the final ADC must maintain favorable physicochemical properties (e.g., high affinity, low aggregate formation). Similarly, our understanding of the desired properties of ADCs is presently limitedin part due to the multiple internalization and processing steps involved in releasing the final cell-killing agent.",

Using the right kind of linker is very important in order to maintain the antibody-drug stability, and hence they are now being given more importance than earlier after showing failed performance in the previously performed clinical trials. The linkers are now chosen more critically and are thus being restricted to just a few choices namely hydrazones, peptides disulphides and thioethers. \n\nTable1:-Different chemical linkers. \n\nLinkers are further of two types cleavable and non-cleavable: \uf0b7 Non-Cleavable linkers follow ADC lysosomal degradation; in this case the cytotoxic payload is active even when it's attached to the linker and an amino acid residue.

            "text": "Before we move towards the various cargos that are being explored for ADCs, we will briefly summarize recent advances in conjugation techniques and linker designs. Both aspects play a key role in ADC stability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic [58,59]. Relevant parameters for the conjugation strategy are the site-of-attachment, the drug-to-antibody ratio and stability in biological matrices (Fig. 3). While stability is an important design feature of linkers, further aspects like solubility, release mechanisms and multivalency are being considered as relevant for the potency and safety of ADCs. In this section we highlight how researchers have implemented these features in recently developed conjugation methods and linker designs. For a comprehensive overview of site-selective modification strategies for ADCs we would like to bring your attention to a very recent review by Walsh et al. [60] and a detailed and comprehensive review of cleavable linkers can be found in a 2019 review by Bargh et al. [61]. \n\nCurrently approved ADCs exclusively use amine-or thiol-directed conjugation for drug attachment. In these cases, drugs are attached to surface exposed lysine residues or reduced intrachain-disulfides, respectively. By targeting endogenous residues, no engineering of the antibody is necessary. However, the site of attachment and the number of attached molecules is hard to control, leading to a heterogenous product containing multiple ADC species of varying DARs. Furthermore, cysteine conjugation via maleimides poses the risk for hydrolysis and thiolexchange to endogenous proteins in biological matrices [62,63]. These aspects are considered to negatively affect the potency and safety of the conjugates [63][64][65].",

            "text": "The methods reported for single-payload conjugation are limited but recent work has greatly advanced the area, which will bring major benefits to ADC programs by expanding the methods available. \n\nThe future of the field lies in utilising the methods to produce a variety of DAR 1 ADCs and antibody-protein/ antibody-antibody constructs that are not accessible by other means. For the generation of effective ADCs the combination of payload, antibody, and linker are crucial. Highly toxic payloads can benefit from incorporation into DAR 1 ADCs to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutics. Furthermore, by producing diverse payload-antibody combinations improved therapeutics can be accessed. \n\nAs Bruins et al. showed, conjugating an antibody with a single reactive handle allows for the creation of antibodyantibody constructs via a single linker. Further use of antibodies conjugated with a single reactive handle will allow diverse antibody-antibody combinations to be synthesised, opening up new highly targeted bispecific therapies leveraging the combined specificity of each antibody. In a similar manor, single payload attachment will allow for precise 1 : 1 antibody-protein constructs to be made which could be used to probe biological processes by utilising orthogonal binding of an antibody and protein. Alternatively, DAR 1 antibody-protein constructs could be beneficial if size and activity warranted use of a single protein. Furthermore, a controlled delivery of a protein to a specific cell could also be afforded with a cleavable linker, akin to classical ADCs. Whilst all the methods described above allowed access to single-payload species, many require complex antibody or process manipulation which limits DAR 1 ADC recovery and scale-up. Therefore, highly yielding conjugations which do not require chromatographic purifications or antibody manipulation are desired and should be further pursued. \n\nTo enable ADC properties to be effectively tuned, research into accessing other classically challenging DARs (such as 3) should be carried out via considered linker design and site selective conjugation. With robust methods developed, ADCs with precise DARs of 1-8 could be easily accessed, allowing for the drug loading to be tuned to balance the ADC's properties.",

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are touted for their ability to site selectively deliver a small molecule chemotherapeutic directly to a tumor cell, bypassing off target side effects from systemic circulation. To date, twelve ADCs have been FDA approved in the United States and >200 more in the clinical pipeline. While ADCs have proven successful in both solid and hematological cancers, resistance and tumor heterogeneity are major causes of failure clinically.[1] Tumor heterogeneity is known to lead to recurrence, metastasis, and acquired resistance to ADCs and other therapeutic strategies. Heterogenous tumors with differential drug sensitivities result in aggressive tumor growth, high relapse rates, and poor survival. To combat these challenges, the majority of chemotherapeutic regimens consist of a combination of drugs. Co-delivery of small molecules can overcome resistance, generate additive or synergistic effects, and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Emergence of tumors refractory to current therapies has given impetus to the evaluation of new ADC formats. This challenge has led to the exploration of dual-drug ADCs capable of delivering two mechanistically distinct payloads simultaneously. Strategies for the construction of dual-drug ADCs involve attachment of both drugs to one linker or through the use of two different conjugation sites on the antibody. Herein, we will review the synthesis and evaluation of the dual-drug ADCs reported to date. We focus on ADCs constructed by conjugation of linkers directly to antibody scaffolds and not to other formats or targeting molecules.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is an antibody conjugated with cytotoxic drugs via a chemical linker. It is a rapidly growing cancer therapeutic class which has a broader therapeutic window compared with conventional cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. ADC in cancer therapy is designed to bind to cancer-associated cell-surface antigens and internalize into cancer cells. Then the cytotoxic drugs are released into the cytoplasm leading to the target cell death. Although the concept of ADC is clear and straightforward, it is still challenging to develop an ideal ADC with the appropriate combination of antibody, linker and cytotoxic drug, and commercially available ADCs are still limited (1).\n\nRecently, we developed a novel ADC technology platform with a novel DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitor, DXd, and a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker (2,3). Trastuzumab deruxtecan (ENHERTU, T-DXd, DS-8201), a novel HER2-directed ADC with this DXd-ADC technology, demonstrated potent antitumor activity with acceptable safety profiles in preclinical models and patients with HER2-positive cancers (2,(4)(5)(6)(7)(8). Trastuzumab deruxtecan has received an accelerated approval from FDA and PMDA for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The DXd-ADC technology has desirable characteristics for ADC including a highly potent payload (DXd) with a short systemic half-life, a cleavable linker designed to be tumor selective which is stable in circulation, and an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) up to 8 being optimized for each target. These features enable the wide therapeutic window of the ADC with high antitumor potency and less systemic toxicity (9). In the preclinical setting, the DXd-ADC technology has been effective when applied to target other cancerassociated antigens as well (10",

We explore the implications of different conjugation techniques on drug-to-antibody ratios and the ratios of the two payloads, as well as their impact on process complexity and manufacturability. Additionally, we address the potential advantages of dual-payload ADCs compared to ADCs combined with traditional chemotherapy or single-payload ADC/ADC combinations.

Finally, disulfide bonds are extensively employed in peptide-drug conjugates, owing to what can be high plasma stability, and yet well-known intracellular cleavage by disulfide reduction. Their stability can be further enhanced through the addition of one or two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide bond. Hence, hydrazone, ester, amide, disulfide, dipeptide, tripeptide, and glucuronide-based linkers provide a diverse set of linkers that can meet most needs in the assembly of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted delivery (Figure 8). In ADCs, the linker is installed by conjugation of the linker-drug moiety to the antibody which most often occurs on the reactive surface residues of antibodies such as cysteine and lysine residues [68,200,[210][211][212][213]. The conjugation is a very critical step in ADC synthesis since typically there are multiple cysteine and lysine residues and without optimization results in a heterogeneous distribution in site and number of drugs that are loaded to the antibody. Molecular engineering and enzymatic modification have provided non-native amino acids to facilitate site-specific conjugation, but there remain technical challenges in commercial-scale production of homogenous ADCs [60,[214][215][216]. Peptide-drug conjugates benefit in employing total chemical synthesis that involves orthogonal side chain protection to control product integrity.",

This aromatization process affords a resulting diradical that can abstract two hydrogen atoms from the DNA backbone, leading to unrepairable double-strand (ds) DNA breaks followed by cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, see Figure 5   A crucial feature for successful construction of an ADC is the conjugation chemistry of the linker-payload with the mAb. In Mylotarg \u00ae , the bifunctional 4-(4-acetylphenoxy)butanoic acid moiety provides attachment to surface-exposed lysine residues of the mAb through an amide bond, and the linker forms an acyl hydrazone linkage with the payload. Mylotarg \u00ae is considered a first-generation ADC because it utilizes N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry to conjugate calicheamicin to surface-exposed lysine residues on the antibody, yielding a heterogenous mixture with different drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) [38]. The number of conjugated calicheamicin derivatives per mAb ranges from zero to six, with an average drug loading of two to three molecules of calicheamicin per antibody. \n\nThe acid-cleavable hydrazone linker is designed to be stable in the neutral pH conditions encountered during circulation, however, hydrolysis is readily achieved under the acidic environment of lysosomes (pH ~4.5-5.0) inside CD33+ target cells. The dimethyl disulfide moiety preserves the natural disulfide trigger mechanism of calicheamicin, while the added steric hindrance resulting from the methyl substituents protects the disulfide from reduction during circulation [38,39]. \n\nAs for all humanized antibodies, complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting was used for humanization of the anti-CD33 murine antibody, hP67.6, employed in Mylotarg \u00ae [40,41].",

We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of targeted therapy used in the treatment of various cancers. As of late 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four ADCs, three ADCs are undergoing regulatory review, and over 100 ADCs are in the clinical pipeline. 1 Their medical potential is based on their structure, since it combines the ability of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to specifically target a tumor-associated antigen 2 with the cell-killing ability of potent cytotoxic drugs via a chemical linker. \n\nThese unique targeted drugs, however, pose both technological and developmental challenges. One key characteristic of an ADC is the drug:antibody ratio (DAR), which is the number of cytotoxic drug molecules per molecule of antibody. The DAR defines the two major types of ADCs: heterogeneous (conjugated in random positions that vary between mAbs) and homogeneous (conjugation at specific sites that are defined in each mAb molecule). The four commercially available ADCs are heterogeneous due to limitations in the technology available when they were originally developed. The lack of efficient methods for producing completely homogeneous ADCs has compelled pharmaceutical companies to develop site-specific conjugation methods, which improves ADC homogeneity, 3 batch-to-batch consistency, and is more desirable from a regulatory perspective. 4 [7][8][9][10][11][12] Cysteine-engineered residues have been introduced into different antibodies by site-directed mutation to provide free thiol groups for conjugation using conventional thiolspecific maleimide linkers, 13 a technology developed by Seattle Genetics and used to produce the heterogeneous ADC brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), which was approved by FDA in 2011. ][16] Non-recombinant methods for reducing ADC heterogeneity that enable the production of homogeneous ADCs based on existing antibodies have also been developed. For example, disubstituted maleimide linkers have been used for synthesizing homogeneous ADCs via interchain cysteine cross-linking through disulfide bonds rebridging. 17",

Nonetheless, there is still an unmet clinical need for wider application, better efficacy, and fewer side effects of ADCs. An ADC generally comprises an antibody, a linker and a payload, and the combination has profound effects on drug structure, pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy. Hence, optimization of the key components provides an opportunity to develop ADCs with higher potency and fewer side effects.

            "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use highly target-selective antibodies to carry potent cytotoxic compounds (payloads) to tumor cells, which enhances the therapeutic index for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types. 1,2 Payloads are covalently bound to the antibody through stable linkers to reduce cytotoxicity to healthy cells during the circulation of ADCs in the bloodstream. Two common methods to conjugate payload-linkers to antibodies are through cysteine (Cys) or lysine (Lys) residues on the antibody, although other site-specific technologies have also been developed. In the case of cysteine-based conjugates, it is well known that the 4 inter-chain disulfide bonds of antibodies can be partially reduced to generate a maximum of 8 free cysteine thiols for drug conjugation to yield \"random cysteine-linked\" ADCs. 3,4 Hamblett et al. reported that incorporating an average of 2-4 drugs relative to the antibody (drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)) would achieve the best balance between the slow clearance from circulation and maximal potency. 5 In lysinebased conjugates, the primary amines of the N-termini and lysine residues of antibodies are used as conjugation sites. A typical antibody usually contains 80-100 lysine residues and most of them are accessible for conjugation. 6 However, each antibody can usually achieve 1-8 lysine-linked conjugations, with an average DAR of 3-4, 7 resulting in heterogeneous lysine conjugates. Given the complexity of ADCs, the two most critical quality attributes (CQAs), i.e., the average DAR and the conjugations location, must be addressed during their development. \n\nSeveral synthetic protocols for lysine-linked ADCs have been described by Brun et al. The \"one-step conjugation\" approach is often used for the conjugation of antibodies with non-cleavable linkers that are already connected to payloads. These conjugations also can be carried out using a two-step protocol.",

This aFC is based on the conjugation of dansyl sulfonamide ethyl amine (DSea)-linker maleimide on interchain cysteines of trastuzumab used as a reference antibody. The resulting aFC was first characterized by routine analytical methods (SeC, SDS-PaGe, Ce-SDS, HIC and native MS), resulting in similar chromatograms, electropherograms and mass spectra to those reported for hinge Cys-linked aDCs. IdeS digestion of the aFC was then performed, followed by reduction and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. Dye loading and distribution on light chain and Fd fragments were calculated, as well as the average dye to antibody ratio (Dar) for both monomeric and multimeric species. In addition, by analyzing the Fc fragment in the same run, full glycoprofiling and demonstration of the absence of additional conjugation was easily achieved. \n\nas for naked antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins, IdeS proteolytic digestion may rapidly become a reference analytical method at all stages of aDC discovery, preclinical and clinical development. The method can be routinely used for comparability assays, formulation, process scale-up and transfer, and to define critical quality attributes in a quality-bydesign approach. mabs Volume 6 Issue 1 or biotin 16 ).",

To improve the conventional conjugations that are currently applied to generate these heterogeneous products, various site-specific approaches have been developed. These methods couple cytotoxins or chemotherapeutic drugs to specifically defined sites in antibody molecules including cysteine, glutamine, unnatural amino acids, short peptide tags, and glycans. The ADCs produced showed high homogeneity, increased therapeutic index, and strong antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, there are recent trends in using these next generation technologies beyond the cytotoxin-conjugated ADC. These site-specific conjugations have been applied for the generation of many different immunoconjugates including bispecific Fab or small molecule\u2013antibody conjugates, immunosuppressive antibodies, and antibody\u2013antibiotic conjugates.

            "text": "An exciting approach to the targeted delivery of drugs in cancer therapy is the use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which was named as the \"magic bullet\" by Paul Ehrlich [103]. He proposed the use of an antibody against tumor cells conjugated to the diphtheria toxin for cancer therapy. ADCs are drugs designed to target specific receptors on tumor cells, CSCs, or tumor-associated cells for localized intracellular delivery [104,105]. An ADC consists of a drug bound to an antibody by conjugation via a special protein, called the linker protein (Figure 7). After binding to a surface receptor on CSCs, ADC is engulfed by the CSC, and the drug is released from the conjugate to eliminate the cell [104]. The most important factor in the design of an ADC is the selection of a target antigen that binds with a high specificity to the antibody to minimize off-target toxic side effects to healthy cells. The number and density of target antigen molecules on the surface of CSCs affect the extent of the ADC engulfment by tumor cells. Further, antigen secretion by the CSCs to the circulation should be minimal to limit the circulatory detection of the ADC-antigen and activation of the immune system. Table 1 summarizes the list of surface antigens on tumor cells used in designing antibody-drug conjugates for different types of cancers [104,106]. \n\nAnother factor is the selection of an antibody to target the antigens on the surface of CSCs with a high specificity, strong binding affinity, and long circulation half-life for prolonged uptake and retention by the tumor tissue. The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107]. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADC is affected by the choice of linker that connects the antibody to the drug molecule. The linker should stabilize the ADC in circulation but provide a mechanism for the release of the payload when the ADC reaches the tumor site. Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of antibodies with the potency of small molecules. Despite the simplicity of the concept, designing clinically successful ADCs is rather challenging: after 50 years of research and development there are currently about a dozen approved ADC medicines, and over one hundred are in clinical trials [1,2]. The linker connecting the antibody with the toxic payload is pivotal for the stability of the ADC in systemic circulation and key to the efficient and selective release of the payload at the tumor site [3][4][5][6]. The methodology of antibody modification and ADC linker chemistry is a vast subject crucial for ADC development [7][8][9][10]. \n\nOur goal was to develop linkers and a methodology suitable for site-specific modification of standard monoclonal IgG antibodies without the need for engineered glycans or amino acids. Acylation of \u03b5-amino side chains of lysine leads to nonspecific modification, occasionally affecting antigen-binding domains [11]. Controlled reduction of cysteine followed by reaction with maleimide or disulfide rebridging reagents is a common technique for ADC assembly [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This approach can be considered site-selective because interchain disulfides are more susceptible to reduction than intra-chain ones, and their number is well-known and strictly defined for each IgG subtype. In addition, they are located far from the antigen-binding site. However, this approach requires careful optimization to prevent the loss of integrity of IgG [11,19]. In addition to these classic well-known methods, there is also a whole class of new methods that allow for the introduction of functional groups into IgG with exceptional precision, but which require manipulation of its structure through genetic engineering. Such methods include genetically engineered introduction of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) [20] with biorthogonal functional groups [21], as well as the introduction of various peptide tags for subsequent selective enzymatic ligation [4,[22][23][24]. These methods are complicated and do not allow using an \"off the shelf\" antibody.",

            "text": "In the last decade, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have evolved into promising and efficient therapeutic agents for targeted chemotherapy, with 9 ADCs currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 80 in clinical studies [1]. ADCs are generated through the conjugation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which specifically target the tumor cell, with highly potent cytotoxic drug payloads. Both elements are covalently bound via a cleavable or non-cleavable chemical linker. First-generation ADCs suffered from insufficient potency of the payload or toxicity due to the instability of the ADC, leading to premature drug release [2]. Extensive development efforts led to secondgeneration ADCs, with more potent payloads, improved linker stability and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs [3]. Bestselling second-generation ADCs include brentuximab vedotin (BV, Adcetris \u00ae from Seattle Genetics) and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla \u00ae from Roche) [4]. However, challenges remain for these ADCs, most notably related to product heterogeneity. Drug conjugation typically occurs through primary amines of lysine sidechains (T-DM1) or cysteine thiol groups after reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds (BV). The conjugation process results in a heterogeneous mixture of species ranging from 0 to 8 payload molecules per antibody, with average drug-to-antibody ratios (avDAR) of 3-4. Drawbacks of the second-generation ADCs include competition with unconjugated mAbs, but also fast clearance and possible aggregation of high DAR species [5,6].",

Adcetris \u00ae (Brentuximab Vedotin, 2013; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2012b) is an antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. B.V. is obtained through the covalent conjugation of the mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody IgG1 antiCD30 (cAC 10), with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). This ADC uses a maleimidocaproyl-valine-citruline-paminobenzyloxycarbonyl linker to promote the proteolytic cleavage by Cathepsin B. Through cysteine-maleimide reaction, the corresponding mAb is joined to the potent antimitotic agent (monomethyl auristatin E [MMAE]) (Figure 8A). This toxin is a synthetic antitubulin analog, using an enzymatically cleavable dipeptide linker. On average, each antibody molecule was conjugated into four groups of MMAE. \n\nOn the other hand, Kadcyla \u00ae (Trastuzumab emtansine) (U.S. \n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), 2013) is an innovative, unique, and selective antineoplastic drug used in patients with advanced breast cancer (HER2+). This ADC is composed of the antiHER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin \u00ae ) and the cytotoxic microtubules agent, DM1, bound through a bifunctional succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) as a non-cleavable linker (Figure 8B).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) selectively deliver potent toxic payloads to antigen-positive tumor cells via specific antibody binding to reduce off-target toxicity and widen the therapeutic window in comparison to chemotherapeutics or combination therapy. Recent successes in the development of ADCs for targeted cancer therapy, such as Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00ae , SGN-35, Seattle Genetics, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) and Trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae , T-DM1, Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, have proven that ADCs can be potent weapons used in the battle against cancer [1][2][3][4]. \n\nAll approved ADCs are produced by chemical conjugation that covalently attaches the toxic payload to the antibody through surface-exposed lysine or cysteine residues generated by reducing intrachain disulfide bonds of the antibody, which leads to heterogeneous mixtures in terms of position and stoichiometry of the payload coupled to the antibody (defined as \"drug to antibody ratio\", DAR). Furthermore, different DAR of ADCs will have different efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, stability and safety profiles [5], which result in a huge challenge in quality control. Consequently, diverse site-specific conjugation technologies have been further developed to produce homogeneous ADCs. One option is engineering free cysteines into antibodies which can react with maleimide-functionalized toxins, thereby yielding homogeneous ADCs with an improved therapeutic window [6]. Nonetheless, this approach requires a reduction-reoxidation procedure that can potentially lead to the formation of faulty intrachain or interchain disulfide bonds. Besides, the cysteine-maleimide linkages are instable in a circulatory system, because the maleimide-linker reaction can be exchanged by the active thiol group of cysteine in human serum, resulting in the premature release of toxins before internalization [7].",

            "text": "conjugation of MMAE and MMAF was selected to make ADCs capable of killing a broad range of breast cancer cells. MMAE is cell membranepermeable and capable of killing not only the initial target cell but also neighboring cells by diffusion upon intracellular release (bystander effect). However, MMAE is a good substrate of the drug efflux pump such as the multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). In contrast, MMAF is cell membrane-impermeable and does not cause bystander killing, but cannot be pumped out once delivered to the intracellular compartment.\n\nMicrobial transglutaminase (MTGase)-mediated transpeptidation exclusively conjugated the bi-functional branched linker onto the side chain of glutamine 295 (Q295) within N297A anti-HER2 mAb, affording a highly homogeneous antibody-linker conjugate (second panel in Fig. 2a). Subsequently, we tested whether the two orthogonal clickable handles within the branched linkers enabled selective introduction of the distinct payload modules. The anti-HER2 mAb-tri-arm linker conjugate underwent consecutive methyltetrazine-TCO and azide-DBCO cycloadditions in one pot with TCO-MMAF and DBCO-MMAE modules. These cycloadditions afforded a dual-drug ADC with a DAR of 4 + 2 (MMAE + MMAF) in a quantitative manner (third and fourth panels, Fig. 2a). We also prepared highly homogeneous anti-HER2 dual-drug ADCs with varied DARs (MMAE/F 2 + 2 and MMAE/F 2 + 4), as well as single-drug ADCs equipped with MMAE or MMAF at DARs of 2, 4, or 6 in a similar manner or according to previously reported methods [31][32][33] (Fig. 2b). The liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) traces illustrate that this sequential conversion did not yield undesired conjugates derived from cross-reactions between mismatched click pairs in either case ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Notes).\n\nTo test whether this methodology can be used for constructing",

            "text": "ADCs consist of three primary elements: tumor-specific mAbs, cytotoxic small molecules forming the active payload, and a bespoke chemical linker that aKaches the mAb to the payload [19]. In an ideal scenario, the mAb-targeted antigens are predominantly expressed in tumors, scarcely or not at all in normal tissues, and exhibit robust internalization and uptake, enabling the rapid and specific delivery of cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells. ADCs commonly target MM cell surface antigens such as BCMA, CD38, CD138, and FcRH5. The payloads in ADCs are usually traditional cytotoxic drugs, divided into two classes: microtubule inhibitors and DNA damaging agents [17]. Despite the notable efficacy of frontline treatments like BTZ, lenalidomide, and daratumumab, their application in ADCs remains limited. Chemical linkers in ADCs are mainly composed of cleavable (acid-labile, protease-cleavable, and disulfide bond linkers) and non-cleavable types. The cleavable linkers are designed to break down under specific cellular conditions, whereas the non-cleavable linkers are more robust, relying on lysosomal degradation of the mAb framework to release the active payload [20][21][22]. These linkers are engineered to aKach to designated amino acid residues on the monoclonal antibody, while the opposite end forms a chemical bond with the small molecule drug, ensuring stability during circulation and effective release upon target cell entry. In the systemic administration of ADCs for relapsed or refractory MM patients, the monoclonal antibody initially targets and binds to antigens on the MM cell surface, facilitating ADC internalization. Subsequently, the linker undergoes cleavage in the unique cellular milieu, liberating the cytotoxic drug that induces cellular damage and apoptosis (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutic agents consisting of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) covalently bound with a cytotoxic drug through a chemical linker. The mAb preferentially targets cell surface antigens overexpressed in tumor cells. Upon binding, the ADC is internalized by the tumor cell, where it undergoes lysosomal degradation, leading to the release of the cytotoxic drug. The use of targeted delivery of highly potent cytotoxic drugs is designed to enhance the antitumor activity while minimizing the toxicity in normal tissues. Additionally, this therapeutic approach takes advantage of the favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the antibody to provide a sustained delivery of the cytotoxic drug. \n\nMany ADCs in clinical development use a protease-labile dipeptide linker (valine-citrulline [vc]), conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via solvent-accessible thiols present in mAb cysteines (vc-MMAE ADC). 1 A representative structure of a vc-MMAE ADC is shown in Figure 1. 2 Conjugation through reduced inter-chain disulfide cysteine residues results in a heterogeneous mixture of conjugated antibodies, with even-numbered drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) species of 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. The average DARs for most of vc-MMAE ADCs in clinical development are approximately 3-4. In 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a vc-MMAE ADC, brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u2122) for the treatment of relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. 3 iven the complex structure of ADCs, which contain both large and small molecule components, and the mixture of various DAR species in the dosing solution, the PK of ADCs are expected to be complex. ADCs are expected to be cleared through two major pathways: proteolytic degradation and deconjugation. 4,5",

Stability, drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and drug distribution have all been shown to be crucial to the efficacy, safety and overall pharmacological pro\ue103le of ADCs and are strongly in\ue104uenced by the chemistry used to attach the linker to the antibody. Commonly employed nucleophilic bioconjugation at cysteine or lysine residues are pseudorandom: in theory, any of the targeted amino acids within the antibody can be modi\ue103ed. Consequently, there is a lack of selectivity, leading to the formation of ADCs which are heterogeneous in terms of the number of cytotoxin molecules incorporated (the DAR) and their locations on the antibody. Such constructs are associated with unreliable pharmacokinetic pro\ue103les and therefore, a reduced pharmacological effect. [13][14][15][16][17] Maleimide conjugation to reduced antibody cysteine thiols has been extensively used in ADC development (Fig. 1a). However, the formed succinimide thioether is inherently unstable in the body (due to a retro-Michael reaction) which leads to premature dissociation of the payload from the antibody. 18,19 The plasma stability of maleimide-based linkers has been increased by hydrolysis of the succinimide thioether ring through linker modi\ue103cations or antibody engineering. 20,21 However, an inherently stable linker is preferential.

            "text": "Therefore, it can be concluded that maytansine payloads can be used to generate highly potent ADCs by site-specific conjugation using sortase enzymes and involving the formation of peptide bonds in absence of any additional linker structures. \n\nIn case of the chemically conjugated anti-CD30 ADC brentuximab-vedotin (Adcetris), it has been published that full cell killing activity requires release of the payload inside tumor cells via cathepsin B mediated enzymatic cleavage at the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, followed by release of free MMAE by self-immolation of the PAB-spacer [4]. Consistent with this, we have found that the sortase-conjugated anti-CD30-vcPAB-MMAE ADC was equally potent as the chemically conjugated ADC Adcetris, because the same cleavable linker structure was contained effecting efficient release of the MMAE payload. In further experiments, a trastuzumab-MMAE ADC was generated, in which the vcPAB linker was omitted by directly attaching the Gly 5 -linker to the MMAE toxin. Absence of the vcPAB moiety led to an ADC with very limited potency with an IC 50 of >1\u03bcg/ml on SKBR3 cells (data not shown). This is fully consistent with published data on conjugates with MMAE payloads [42]. In contrast, a sortase-conjugated trastuzumab-monomethylauristatin F (MMAF) ADC, in which the payload was directly attached to the Gly 5 linker, effected efficient killing of SKBR3 cells with an IC 50 similar to that of Kadcyla and the other maytansine-conjugates (data not shown). This observation is also consistent with previously published data, in which highly potent chemically conjugated MMAF ADCs have been generated without inclusion of a cleavable vcPAB linker structure [43].",

            "text": "One group prepared a series of maytansinoid-coupled ADCs with a DAR range from 2 to 14, using both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, to evaluate the preclinical and clinical effects of DAR, including in vivo stability, efficacy, and tolerability [79,83]. Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

            "text": "Cysteine residues of monoclonal antibodies remain a popular site for conjugation and are most often targeted by maleimide-based payloads. However, the newly formed thiosuccinimide ring resulting from thiol-maleimide chemistry is susceptible to thiol exchange or retro-Michael addition, resulting in premature drug release leading to lower efficacy and increased off-target toxicity [12]. One way to overcome the instability of thiol-maleimide conjugation is to use alternative conjugation methods leading to plasma stable thioethers at cysteine in a rapid and efficient manner. The reaction of thiol with the iodoacetyl group to form a stable thioether bond is one such conjugation technique and has been previously employed for making ADCs [12][13][14][15]. The design of branched heterofunctional linkers for obtaining high-DAR ADCs is shown in Figure 2. Each of the described branched linkers uses the iodoacetyl reacting group to conjugate cysteine-inserted antibodies in an efficient manner at elevated pH to form a stable thioether linkage. The linkers carry cyclic dienes which react efficiently via the Diels-Alder reaction with commonly available maleimide payloads to form plasma stable ADCs [16]. Our DAR 4 linker (D4) carries two cyclic dienes capable of reacting with two maleimide payloads, while our DAR 6 linker (D6) carries three and DAR 8 linker (D8) carries four cyclic diene units. While each of our D4 and D6 linkers carry a short spacer to conjugate free cysteines in an antibody, our D8 linker carries a diethylene glycol unit (PEG 2) to overcome any potential steric hinderance caused by the bulky nature of the linker. The synthesis of the designed branched linkers is described in Scheme 1 (detailed procedure for the intermediates can be found in the Supplementary Information). The synthesis of the D4 and D8 linkers used commercially available serinol, while the D6 linker started from commercially available tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (tris base).",

            "text": "Behrens et al., 2015). Coupled with selection of proper linker structure and payload, this method can potentially lead to ADCs with enhanced PK/PD and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nRecently, Buchwald and co-workers developed a rapid, highly selective cysteine conjugation using aryl palladium complexes (Vinogradova et al., 2015) (Fig. 4C). The aryl palladium reagents are readily prepared by mixing active palladium-phosphine complexes and various aryl halides. The resulting complexes undergo a thiol arylation with reduced cysteine residues of the antibody in a rapid and selective manner. They demonstrated the potential of this new method in direct conjugation with trastuzumab and a palladium complex of vandetanib (a kinase inhibitor), which gave a linker-free ADC with a DAR of 4.4. Although the obtained ADC lacked a linker, it retained binding affinity to recombinant HER2 (K d = 0.1-0.5 nmol/L) comparable to that of the parent trastuzumab. Another advantage of this method is that the resulting aryl-cysteine conjugates are stable towards acids, bases, oxidants, and externally added thiols. While unique and intriguing, this method needs substantial modification or improvement of several critical factors for the future clinical application (toxicity of palladium, workup strategies for complete removal of palladium, cost for palladium complexes, DAR control, etc.). Despite current limitations, further work will provide researchers with profound insights into cysteine-based conjugation chemistry and rational design of reagents for preparing ADCs that could have not been constructed with traditional methods.",

            "text": "The concept of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapeutics combines the unique targeting properties of a monoclonal antibody to deliver a high potency of a cytotoxin attached via an appropriate linker. As the number of ADCs entering the clinic and achieving regulatory approval continues to grow, there remains a concerted research effort to explore alternative drug-linker designs with the aim of enhancing ADC efficacy and safety. A wide array of structural options for the linker component connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic drug exist. Recent attention has focused on the use of site-specific conjugating linkers to improve ADC homogeneity and a variety of both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been employed to maximize toxin delivery to tumor cells (Frigerio and Kyle, 2017;Zhou, 2017;Dal Corso et al., 2019). \n\nRecent research has focused on the inclusion of polymeric portions within ADC linker structure to overcome some of the inherent issues surrounding ADC design such as hydrophobicity, aggregation, instability, insufficient drug-loading and reduced circulatory half-life. Typically, the polymers have been amphiphilic in nature, being water-soluble, synthetic and substantially non-antigenic with particular focus on polyalkylene oxides such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Since the first PEGylated protein was approved in 1990, PEG has become one of the most widely used polymers in biopharmaceutical applications with numerous products entering clinical trials and receiving marketing approval (Veronese and Mero, 2008;Turecek et al., 2016). PEG features within two of the currently approved ADCs, sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy \u00ae ) and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta \u00ae ), and its utility within ADC reagents has been widely investigated, mainly to improve reagent solubility and to reduce aggregation of the final ADC.",

Most antibody payloads impart significant hydrophobicity to the ADC, resulting in accelerated plasma clearance and suboptimal in vivo activity, particularly for conjugates with high drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR). We recently reported on the incorporation of a discrete PEG24 polymer as a side chain in a \u03b2-glucuronidase-cleavable monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) linker to provide homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates with decreased plasma clearance and increased antitumor activity in xenograft models relative to a non-PEGylated control. In this work, we optimized the drug-linker by minimizing the size of the PEG side chain and incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide to prevent payload de-conjugation in vivo. Multiple PEG-glucuronide-MMAE linkers were prepared with PEG size up to 24 ethylene oxide units, and homogeneous DAR 8 ADCs were evaluated. A clear relationship was observed between PEG length and conjugate pharmacology when tested in vivo. Longer PEG chains resulted in slower clearance, with a threshold length of PEG8 beyond which clearance was not impacted. Conjugates bearing PEG of sufficient length to minimize plasma clearance provided a wider therapeutic window relative to faster clearing conjugates bearing shorter PEGs. A lead PEGylated glucuronide-MMAE linker was identified incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide and a PEG12 side chain emerged from these efforts, enabling highly potent, homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates and is under consideration for future ADC programs.

            "text": "Since the 1970s, there have been innumerable approaches to ADC synthesis and development, for both solid and hematological tumors. Multiple types of drug-conjugates were proposed, such as bispecific ADCs, bi-epitope ADCs, fab-fragment of the antibody (FabDCs), single-chain antibody fragment drug conjugates, nanobody drug conjugates, peptide drug conjugates, radioimmune conjugates, bispecific monoclonal antibodies (mAb), dual payloads, nanoparticles, and others [9]. \n\nModern ADCs typically consist of three main components: an antibody, a linker, and a payload (Figure 1). Most ADCs undergo similar mechanisms to release the payload. In general, after intravenous (IV) administration and tissue distribution, ADCs bind target antigens with the antibody moiety and undergo internalization/endocytosis. In the endosomes (if cleavable), the payload is released via protease (such as cathepsin B) cleavage of the linker or by the degradation of the ADC. The activated payload diffuses to cytosol and the nucleus, binds to microtubules or DNA, and triggers cell death (Figure 2). If lipophilic, the activated payload can diffuse into the microenvironment and kill neighbor cells (bystander effect) [10]. \n\nDepending on linker technology, different proportions of the payload may be systemically released, contributing to systemic toxicity, or acting as traditional chemotherapy. In some cases, the systemic payload release was so significant that concerns were raised if there was any ADC attributed activity at all [11]. Some of these concerns are also based on studies suggesting that less than 1% of the administered ADC reaches the target tumor site [12]. Radiolabeled antibody studies showed that only 0.01% of the injected antibody could be localized in a solid tumor mass 24 h after infusion, irrespective of tumor type or antibody target [13]. The immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody molecular mass is 146 kDa [14].",

However, many of the compounds used in such antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are substrates for the multidrug transporter MDR1. To evade the MDR1-mediated resistance, we conjugated the highly cytotoxic maytansinoid DM1 to antibodies via the maleimidyl-based hydrophilic linker PEG(4)Mal. Following uptake into target cells, conjugates made with the PEG(4)Mal linker were processed to a cytotoxic metabolite that was retained by MDR1-expressing cells better than a metabolite of similar conjugates prepared with the nonpolar linker N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). In accord, PEG(4)Mal-linked conjugates were more potent in killing MDR1-expressing cells in culture. In addition, PEG(4)Mal-linked conjugates were markedly more effective in eradicating MDR1-expressing human xenograft tumors than SMCC-linked conjugates while being tolerated similarly, thus showing an improved therapeutic index. This study points the way to the development of ADCs that bypass multidrug resistance.",

            "text": "As a promising drug for treating tumors, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) [15] covalently bind cytotoxic chemicals (known as warheads) to antibodies through linkers using a conjugation strategy. Eight of the thirteen ADCs approved by the FDA employ a Cys conjugation strategy, including Adcetris\u2122, and Trodelvy\u2122, Zynlonta\u2122, among others [16] (Figure 3a). These marketed Cys-conjugated ADCs are primarily obtained by reacting thiol groups with various maleimide-based linkers [17]. The maleimide-thiol strategy has certain limitations, such as the need for a slightly acidic pH to avoid cross-reaction with lysine (Lys) residues and the retro-Michael reaction between the adduct and biological thiols in plasma, leading to premature release. To inhibit the retro-Michael reaction, although hydrolyzing the maleimide in the adduct can enhance conjugate stability and produce a more potent ADC, incomplete hydrolysis limits this strategy. Therefore, based on the maleimide-thiol strategy, an increasing number of Michael acceptors are being used as new linkers for Cys coupling [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26], including 3-bromo-5-methylene pyrrolones (3Br-5MPs), \u03b1-unsaturated compounds, and vinyl/alkyne-phosphonamides, among others (Figure 3b). In 2019, Bernardim et al. [18] utilized carbonyl acrylic acid reagents as Michael acceptors to achieve chemo-selective and irreversible bioconjugation of Cys residues under biocompatible conditions (Figure 4a). The adduct conjugates formed by this strategy not only prevent the retro-Michael reaction with biological thiols in plasma but also remain unaffected by competing nucleophilic AAs (e.g., Lys) at slightly basic pH.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) or immunoconjugates are a sub-class of biotherapeutics designed to facilitate the targeted delivery of potent cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells. The creation of ADC molecules as a therapeutic modality realized, to a certain degree, a long-standing wish for a \"magic bullet\" that could be harnessed to deliver cytotoxic therapy directly to the source of the disease. 1 ADCs are composed of a cytotoxic drug linked to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) via a chemical linker. The combination takes advantage of the enhanced selectivity of mAbs targeting cancer-specific antigens, and utilizes highly potent cell-killing agents that are otherwise too toxic to develop as therapeutics by minimizing systemic toxicity. ADCs have recently shown promise in the treatment of various cancers. 2 Many novel ADCs are currently in preclinical, early clinical or late-stage clinical development for the treatment of solid and hematologic tumors. 3,4 Two ADC drugs were approved recently by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00d2 , Seattle Genetics), and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u00d2 , Genentech). The commercial success of ADCs has generated interest in the development of novel and biosimilar ADCs across the biopharmaceutical industry. \n\nDepending on the conjugation chemistry, different types of ADCs can be constructed, e.g., cysteine-conjugated, lysine-conjugated or site-specific ADCs. 5,6 It is important to note that the degree of heterogeneity of the ADC varies with the strategy used for conjugating the drug (through the linker) to the antibody. At a molecular level, all ADC molecules bear complex chemical structures, combining the molecular characteristics of small-molecule drugs with those of large molecule mAbs. In addition, the conjugation reaction employed for the synthesis of ADCs increases the complexity of ADC samples to a higher level by producing a mixture of ADC molecules that are heterogeneous in 2 regards.",

            "text": "Linker chemistry is an important determinant of the safety and efficacy of ADCs. Linkers, which are generally divided into cleavable and non-cleavable types, are designed to be stable in the bloodstream while allowing efficient release of the small molecule cytotoxin after internalization in the target cell [58]. The stability of antibody-drug linkers in systemic circulation has been a key focus in safety evaluations, since premature loss of the small molecule prior to ADC target cell internalization can result in off-target toxicity from non-specific drug release [59]. Strategies to develop ADCs with more stable linkers and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs have been viewed as critical to the effort to improve ADC pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles [13,60]. \n\nAn insufficiently stable linker was thought to represent a possible liability for Mylotarg, although subsequent ADCs utilizing similar acid-labile hydrazone linkers, e.g., inotuzumab ozogamicin and milatuzumab-doxorubicin, have shown good stability in human plasma and serum [14]. However, a comparison of ADCs containing hydrazone linkers with those using protease-sensitive dipeptide linkers showed that the peptide-linked conjugates were much more stable in buffers and plasma than the corresponding hydrazone conjugates, and as a result exhibited more specific delivery and lower systemic toxicity [61]. These results illustrated the importance of conjugation and linker chemistry in achieving a favorable therapeutic index. \n\nSpecies differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies.",

ADCs developed using AF with a non-cleavable linker at the C-terminus have shown potent cell killing activity and improved pharmacological profile in vivo. 6 The non-cleavable ethylene glycol linker derivatized with an alkoxy-amine was synthesized and attached to the AF as previously described. 6 The keto-containing m860 IgG was coupled to the alkoxy-amine linker-derivatized AF (3 mM) in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 C for 60 h, followed by purification with a size exclusion column. Analysis by ESI-MS revealed that the heavy chain of the ADC has a mass 1747 Da larger than the keto group carrying IgG1 m860 heavy chain, which corresponds to the mass of two drug molecules with linker (nAF) per heavy chain (Fig. 5); this result is also consistent with the MALDI-TOF profile of the released oligosaccharide from the m860ADC (Fig. 4B).\n\nPurified m860ADC was tested for binding to cell surfaceexpressed HER2 and compared with naked antibody IgG1 m860 and also Trastuzumab. The binding activity of of IgG1 m860 and Trastuzumab to SKBR3 is very similar (Fig. 6A). Also the binding activity of m860ADC to HER2 on SKBR3 cells was very well preserved (Fig. 6A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified m860ADC and naked IgG1 m860 under reducing and onreducing conditions showed that the antibody is stable after the modification and conjugation treatment at 37 for 6 d (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, to evaluate whether the conjugation of the AF to glycans on the IgG1 m860 may sterically interfere with its binding activity to FcgRIIIa and FcgRI, Biacore analysis was performed to measure the binding",

In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

            "text": "First-generation cysteine-based site-specific antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are limited to one drug per cysteine. However, certain applications require a high drug to antibody ratio (DAR), such as when low-potency payloads are used. Higher drug load can be achieved using classical cysteine conjugation methods, but these result in heterogeneity, suboptimal efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and validation of heterobifunctional linkers that can be used for the preparation of ADCs with a DAR of two, three and four in a site-specific manner per single cysteine conjugation site, resulting in site-specific ADCs with a DAR of four, six and eight. The designed linkers carry a sulfhydryl-specific iodoacetyl reactive group, and multiple cyclic diene moieties which can efficiently react with maleimide-carrying payloads through the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. As a proof of concept, we synthesized site-specific DAR four, six and eight ADCs carrying tubulysin (AZ13601508) using engineered antibodies with a cysteine inserted after position 239 in the antibody CH2 domain. We evaluated and compared the in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCs obtained via the site-specific platform described herein, with ADCs prepared using classical cysteine conjugation. Our data validated a novel cysteine-based conjugation platform for the preparation of site-specific ADCs with high drug load for therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a targeted anti-cancer agent consisting of a monoclonal antibody, linkers, and cytotoxic drugs (payload) [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The major characteristics of ADCs for anti-cancer therapy are that it can improve the therapeutic window by delivering cytotoxic drugs selectively to target cells [7][8][9]. Therefore, ADC is expected to solve unmet needs that cannot be solved with existing anti-cancer therapy. Since Mylotarg \u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) was approved as the first ADC in 2000, nine ADCs have been approved to date, of which five ADCs have been approved in the last two years. In addition, approximately 70 ADCs are undergoing clinical trials, and many more ADCs are under preclinical developments [9][10][11]. Over 30 years of intensive research and development, activities have made many advances in antibody engineering, linker conjugation platforms, and the diversity of new payloads. In particular, the linker conjugation platform plays an important role in determining the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) complexity and the stability of ADCs in systemic circulation. If the linker was unstable during systemic circulation, ADC's mechanism of action in the target cell would be lost, and the deconjugated linker-payload would be able to cause off-target toxicity by adducting to other proteins or metabolizing to other forms [12][13][14][15][16]. Therefore, many pharmaceutical companies have intensively researched and developed various linker conjugation platforms [16][17][18][19]. \n\nRecently, the Ortho Hydroxy-Protected Aryl Sulfate (OHPAS) linker was developed as a new linker platform by IntoCell Inc. (Daejeon, Korea) and structurally designed with di-aryl sulfate, in which one aryl acting as a phenolic payload and the other acting as a self-immolative group (SIG) consisting a triggering phenol function at the ortho or para position.",

            "text": "The amine group (-NH 2 ) of lysine and sulfhydryl group (-SH) of cysteine in an antibody are generally available for attachment of the linker. A typical IgG1 antibody has roughly 80 lysine residues, but fewer than ten are chemically available for modification. Although random conjugation to lysine residues may generate higher DAR, targeting lysine generates a heterogeneous ADC with a spectrum of DARs and differing conjugation sites. A heterogeneous ADC population with random conjugation sites may confer suboptimal potency and altered solubility, stability, and/or pharmacokinetics, all affecting their antigen-binding properties. Conversely, the advantage of cysteinemediated conjugation is that the limited number and locations of cysteine-conjugation sites generate lower heterogeneity than lysine-based conjugation. Cysteines have a role in the intrachain and interchain disulfide bridges of antibodies. IgG1 antibody has four interchain disulfide bridges, and the bridges can be reduced to eight sulfhydryl groups for conjugation. TOP1-ADCs in a clinical trial for FDA approval have utilized the sulfhydryl group of cysteine to generate ADC. Maleimide chemistry is a common linker strategy for sulfhydryl conjugation. One limitation of maleimide chemistry is that its instability in plasma allows separation of drug-linkers from the ADC. Therefore, work is underway to improve the stability of sulfhydryl-based conjugation; for example, by hydrolysis of succinimide [74,75]. \n\nA major concern in joining the linker to the camptothecin-derived drug is to avoid conjugation sites that diminish drug activity. Since TOP1-ADCs in current clinical trials are formulated with SN-38 or Dxd (exatecan derivative), we focus upon these two drugs in our discussion of linker conjugation.",

So far, ten ADCs have been approved by FDA for oncological indications and many others are currently being tested in clinical and preclinical level. This paper summarizes the essential components of ADCs, from their functional principles and structure up to their limitations and resistance mechanisms, focusing on all latest bioengineering breakthroughs such as bispecific mAbs, dual-drug platforms as well as novel linkers and conjugation chemistries.

            "text": "ADCs are the fastest growing biopharmaceutical drugs because they embrace the specificity of antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small-molecule drugs. However, drug conjugations often deteriorate the molecular characteristics of ADCs. It is still challenging to develop ADCs by using efficient and manageable method. These hurdles limit further ADC development. \n\nHere, we sought to develop a simple and efficient methodology for drug conjugation that maintains the molecular characteristics of ADCs. In this method, three components-An antibody, peptides, and payloads-are conjugated in two chemical steps. In the first conjugation, the peptide and antibody are rapidly conjugated under mild conditions. Through the second conjugation, the payloads are coupled to the peptide via a click reaction. The peptide conjugation method has a series of advantages. Various payloads can be conjugated to antibodies, and their number can be controlled. Since the conjugation reaction is highly site-specific, and proceeds spontaneously, the structural modifications (such as reducing disulfide bonds) of the antibody are not necessary. Thus, the conjugation reaction produced a few byproducts. Cleavable linkers, such as peptide linkers, or disulfide linkers, which are often used to design ADCs, undergo deconjugation in the serum, resulting in off-target cytotoxicity 32 . In contrast, the amine coupled linker used in this study was non-cleavable and highly stable 33 . This conjugation method will allow the development of highly efficient and manageable ADCs. \n\nThe peptide/DOTA-conjugated trastuzumab exhibited enhanced ADCC compared to the non-conjugated trastuzumab. The decreased molecular dynamics (entropy) of the conjugated trastuzumab contributed to the enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIa. The mechanism underlying this effect is that the conjugated peptide induces Fc to be in a pre-optimized (well-prepared) state for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa binding, resulting in a thermodynamically favorable binding. \n\nThe ADCC enhancement due to the peptide conjugation did not interfere with the effect of afucosylation.",

This is achieved through the disruption of the chemical linkage between the antibody and the toxic payload. Thus, the choice of the linker used may have an impact on ADC efficacy and several different types have been synthesized. Acid-labile hydrazone linkers are designed to be stable within the neutral pH extracellular environment, but become cleaved within the low pH environment of intracellular endosome and lysosome compartments. 60 Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). 61 Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. 61 Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. 62 DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63",

We also prepared an analytical amount of classical maleimide-based ADC 2 (a common conjugation strategy employed to make ADCs) to compare its HIC pro\ue103le against our technology. \n\nThe synthesis and characterisation of NGM-MMAE ADC 1 was previously described. 26 Synthesis of classical maleimide-MMAE ADC 2 was adapted from a reported protocol (Fig. 1, see ESI for details \u2020). 9 PD based bridging reagents, with cleavable or non-cleavable linkers, were synthesised from a previously reported PD scaffold 36 in reasonable yields (see ESI for details \u2020). ADCs 3 and 4 were obtained by treatment of TCEPreduced trastuzumab with the relevant bridging reagent as illustrated in Scheme 1. To our delight, in line with the best industry standard, mass spectrometry analysis of the conjugates con\ue103rmed ADCs 3 and 4 to each have a DAR of 4 as the most predominant species by far (Fig. 2A and B, respectively). \n\nFurther to this, key HIC analysis of PD-MMAE ADC 3 showed this conjugate to be synthesised almost exclusively as a DAR 4 species (Fig. 2C). This stands in stark contrast with the typical mixture of different DAR species obtained for classical maleimide-MMAE conjugate 2 (see ESI for full HIC data \u2020). HIC analysis of PD-MMAE ADC 4 displays a more complex pattern to ADC 3; this conjugate appears as a wider peak with a shoulder. Previous HIC analysis of disul\ue103de bridged MMAE ADCs bearing the valine-citrulline linker in the literature also show a similar pattern and those results were interpreted by Badescu et al. as DAR 4 species. 38",

            "text": "The conjugation site can be considered both from a macro viewpoint\ue0d5the targeted antibody domain\ue0d5and a micro viewpoint\ue0d5the local chemical and structural environment, including contributions from the antibody backbone and from the payload linker. To date, our data presented here along with some recent examples suggest that the latter perspective may be more instructive in influencing the design and control over the biological disposition of the resulting ADCs. 6,7,14,32 e tested three aldehyde-tagged ADCs with conjugation sites in distinct antibody domains and observed that the CTtagged ADC had superior PK and in vivo efficacy as compared to the CH1-and LC-tagged ADCs. The serum stability studies with the AF88 amide conjugates showed comparable stability at the three tag sites, whereas the maytansine ester conjugates demonstrated greater stability with the CT conjugate. These observations indicate that the HIPS conjugation to the antibody is inherently stable with little difference across the three sites, and that the difference in the stability of the maytansine conjugates at the three sites is a manifestation of the differences in the protein microenvironment of the three sites and its influence on the ester bond hydrolysis. 33 Although it will need to be demonstrated empirically, we surmise that conjugation sites that work well in the context of an IgG1 ADC (explored here) might also work well in the context of other, related antibody fragments. The likely drivers determining tag site efficacy are protein conformation and the local chemical microenvironment. To the extent that these remain the same or are similar across antibodies or related proteins, our observations may hold true. \n\nThe HIPS chemistry is less subject to environmental influences at different conjugation sites, as it results in a chemically stable C\u2212C bond formation between the protein and the payload. However, other portions of the linker may well influence stability and efficacy. 13 The ability to vary linker composition in order to test the affects of length, hydrophobicity, and conformation remains an important aspect of optimizing in vivo properties of ADCs.",

Furthermore, we envisioned that results from this work might allow us to assign specific composition changes in the ADC based on monoisotopic mass shifts of conjugatable modifications as detected in the surrogate small-molecule conjugates. We tested our hypothesis with a case study using an aldehyde-tag-based ADC conjugated to a noncleavable linker bearing a maytansine payload. Nearly quantitative bioconversion from cysteine to formylglycine was observed in the monoclonal antibody, and bioorthogonal conjugation was detected only on the formylglycine residues in the ADC. Using our method, both conjugatable and nonconjugatable modifications were discovered in the linker/payload; however, only conjugatable modifications were observed on the ADC. Based on these results, we anticipate that our approach to systematic mass spectrometric investigations can be successfully applied to other ADCs and therapeutic bioconjugates for investigational new drug (IND)-enabling extended characterization.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as a therapeutic modality has received renewed interest in this decade due to recent clinical successes. 1 ADC achieves targeted drug delivery by combining potency of cytotoxic drugs with target selectivity of monoclonal antibodies. 2 The antibody recognizes the target antigen, binds, and is then internalized into cells. The linker provides for controlled release of cytotoxic drugs. \n\nADCs may undergo structural changes in circulation or in tissues. The antibody portion may experience proteolysis or amino acid modifications such as deamidation and oxidation, which is common to other protein therapeutics. 3 The linker and payload moieties may undergo changes that directly affect their safety and efficacy. For example, nonspecific payload release may result in undesired toxicity. The released payload components from ADC are subject to small molecule metabolism by enzymes in the liver such as CYP450s. 3 ypically, conjugated linker-payload remains quite stable in circulation due to limited exposure to metabolizing enzymes. However, biotransformations can still occur on the conjugated linker-payload. One reported example is thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis commonly observed on cysteine conjugated ADCs. Once thiosuccinimide is hydrolyzed, the linker-payload is no longer subject to elimination through retro-Michael reaction and thus prevents nonspecific deconjugation. 4,5 Another reported biotransformation is hydrolysis on the payload structure. 6 Other observed changes to linker-payload are cleavages or partial loss, such as hydrazone cleavage, peptide bond cleavage, carbamate cleavage, disulfide cleavage, etc. 3 In summary, the biotransformation of conjugated payload can be very different from released payload or small molecules due to inherent distribution differences, enabling exposure to different compartments and enzymes. \n\nAssessing biotransformation of conjugated payload is important for evaluating whether the biotransformed payload component may still be active. 7 Overall, ADC biotransformation information is valuable for understanding in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics for guiding drug design.",

            "text": "One of the fundamental lessons learned from the first gen- eration of ADCs is that a suitably stable linker is as vital as the antibody and payload for maximization of therapeutic efficacy of the ADC. The ideal linker is systemically stable so that biophysiochemcial property of ADC are similar to that of the unconjugated antibody, but are still able to release the payload at the target site. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel linkers for ADCs, and the most broadly evaluated and utilized linker platforms include both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers: The cleavable linkers include chemically-labile (e.g., hydrazones and disulfides) and protease-labile linkers. These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (van Der Velden et al., 2001;Ulbrich and Subr, 2004). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003;Erickson et al., 2006;Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency.\n\nThe peptide-based linkers are also designed to be retained in the ADC formin circulation, but to release their payload upon cleavage by specific intracellular proteases. For example, Adcetris \u00ae uses the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, which is hydrolyzed by",

            "text": "Cancer is still one of the major threats to human health. However, cancer therapies used today always have more or less adverse side effects to normal tissues. Targeted therapy is a promising strategy to address this challenge. The pioneer of targeted therapy is Paul Ehrlich who introduced the principle \"magic bullet\" at the beginning of the 20th century [1]. To avoid side effects, drugs should be specifically delivered to cancer cells via binding to ligands that can specifically recognize the cancer-associated biomarkers such as antigens. Among the ligands for targeted therapy, antibodies are excellent candidates because of their specific recognitions and high affinities. Nowadays, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are attracting tremendous attention for targeted cancer therapy. \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates are biotherapeutics that consist of monoclonal antibodies, potent cytotoxic drugs and linkers between them (Figure 1). The monoclonal antibodies lead the drug precursors to the target cancer cells, in which the prodrugs can be chemically or enzymatically converted to drugs in their active forms [2]. Conjugating cytotoxins to monoclonal antibodies that specifically tie to tumor cell surface antigens enables the drugs to be target-delivered to cancer cells and leaves normal cells unaffected. More important, many of the cytotoxic drugs that are too toxic for use in traditional chemotherapy can also be used in the construction of antibody-drug conjugates [3,4]. The linkers are also essential parts of antibody-drug conjugates, which account for stability in circulation, good pharmacokinetics and efficient release of toxic drugs in the tumor cells. \n\nThe selection of antibody, drug, and linker has recently been summarized in a few excellent reviews [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In this review, we mainly describe the linking methods to design and synthesize ADCs, including those that are not discussed in the reviews mentioned above. \n\nThe selection of antibody, drug, and linker has recently been summarized in a few excellent reviews [5][6][7][8][9][10][11].",

Acid-cleavable linkers were first used in clinical ADCs, but their structural variety (e.g., hydrazone and carbonate) is still limited, and their stability is usually insufficient. Designing novel acid-cleavable linkers for the conjugation of the popular cytotoxin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) has always been a significant topic. In this paper, we generate a novel, silyl ether-based acid-cleavable antibody-MMAE conjugate, which skillfully achieves efficient combination of amino-conjugated MMAE with the acid-triggered silyl ether group by introducing p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (PHB). The stability, acid-dependence cleavage, effective mechanism, efficacy and safety of the resulting ADC were systematically studied; the results show that it exhibits a significant improvement in stability, while maintaining appropriate efficacy and controlled therapeutic toxicity. This strategy is expected to expand a new type of acid-cleavable linkers for the development of ADCs with highly potent payloads.",

            "text": "The level of conjugated payload is generally considered as a valuable indicator related to ADC efficacy and toxicity [119]. As mentioned previously, LC-MS based quantitative analysis of conjugated ADCs is usually coupled with immunoaffinity pull-down [57,68,91,97]. For ADCs with cleavable linkers, conjugated payload is quantified after isolation of small molecules from proteins and then linker cleavage. For example, for the ADC utilizing an enzymesensitive dipeptide Val-Cit linker (e.g., brentuximab vedotin), the release of payload can be achieved by digestion with proteases such as cathepsin B and papain [67,68,93,94,120e122]. For the ADC with a disulfide bond linker (e.g., coltuximab ravtansin), reducing agent such as DTT and TCEP is employed for cleavage [123,124]. Conventionally, conjugated antibody and conjugated payload are measured by two independent assays using two aliquots of the same samples. Xu et al. [125] introduced an LC-MS approach enabling simultaneous measurement of total antibody and antibody-conjugated drug in plasma samples, followed by immunocapture enrichment. The strategy utilizes sequentially enzymatic digestion with cathepsin B and then Lys-C to release conjugated payload and then signature peptide of the antibody component. The assay platform was further applied in another ADC containing a polymer linker via an ester bond, which was cleaved by sodium hydroxide [99]. \n\nAs mentioned previously, quantification of conjugated payloads of ADCs with cleavable linkers can be achieved after linker cleavage, which is an alternative method to intact LC-MS-based DAR measurement in biological samples [67,68,91,93,94]. The average DAR is calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated payload vs. total antibody, and the change of average DAR could indicate ADC deconjugation in vivo [94].",

Indeed, the clinical success of ADCs has been demonstrated with FDA-approved ADCs for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (Adcetris \u00ae ) 5,6 , HER2-positive breast cancer (Kadcyla \u00ae ) 7, 8 , acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (Besponsa \u00ae ) 9 , and acute myeloid lymphoma (Mylotarg \u00ae ) 10 and more than 60 promising ADCs in clinical trials 11,12 . The striking success has driven scientists and clinicians to further advance this molecular platform for developing effective therapeutics for cancers, microbial infection 13, and immune modulation 14 . \n\nADCs consist of potent drugs (payloads) linked to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) through chemical linkers. This molecular format enables pinpoint delivery of highly cytotoxic payloads to target tumor cells, resulting in greater potency, a broader therapeutic window, and more durable treatment effect than are possible with traditional chemotherapy agents alone 15,16 . In addition to the choice of the antibody and payload, the ADC linker structure and antibody-payload conjugation modality impact ADC homogeneity, cytotoxic potency, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK). These key parameters critically contribute to overall in vivo therapeutic efficacy [17][18][19][20] . Thus, refining linker and conjugation chemistries is of crucial importance for optimizing the therapeutic potential and safety profiles of ADCs. \n\nValine-citrulline (VCit) dipeptide linkers connecting a payload with a p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) group are standard cleavable linkers widely used in many successful ADCs including the FDA-approved ADC Adcetris 21,22 .",

            "text": "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a combination of biological and small-molecule drugs that have recently received increased interest as therapeutic choices in oncology. ADCs are composed of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which specifically binds to a cell surface target, a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. After binding to its cell-surface antigen, the mAb induces endocytosis of said antigen, shuttling the toxic payload inside the cell. Depending on the linker type, the toxic payload is released from the mAb via a cleavable linker, and exits the lysosome either before or during proteolysis [1]. Alternatively, with the use of a non-cleavable linker, the payload cannot enter the cytosol until after the lysosome fully degrades, at which point it is then free to perform its anti-cancer effect [2]. Additionally, there has also been an increased focus on developing ADCs that do not require internalizing into the cell interior for their therapeutic effect. Radioimmunoconjugates are specific antibodies that can bind to cancer cell-surface markers, and deliver localized radiation to the cell due to their conjugation to radioactive isotopes [3]. This effect takes place outside of the cell, with no internalization required. There are also ADCs with non-radioactive conjugates that still rely on extracellular cleavage of their linker, which allows for the diffusion of the cleaved drug across the cell. In fact, the recently approved ADC Troveldy (Sacituzumab govitecan) operates in just such a manner [4]. While several ADCs have been FDA-approved for cancer treatment, the majority of approved ADCs target hematopoietic tumors. The main ADC approved for solid tumor-targeting is Kadcyla, or T-DM1 [5]. T-DM1 is an ADC specifically used to treat HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer. It is derived from the existing anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab to which emtansine has been conjugated via a non-reducible thioether linker.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Structurally, an ADC comprises an antibody, which serves as the delivery system, a payload drug that is a potent cytotoxin that kills cancer cells, and a chemical linker that connects the payload with the antibody. Unlike conventional chemotherapy methods, an ADC couples the selective targeting and pharmacokinetic characteristics related to the antibody with the potent cytotoxicity of the payload. This results in high specificity and potency by reducing off-target toxicities in patients by limiting the exposure of healthy tissues to the cytotoxic drug. As a consequence of these outstanding features, significant research efforts have been devoted to the design, synthesis, and development of ADCs, and several ADCs have been approved for clinical use. The ADC field not only relies upon biology and biochemistry (antibody) but also upon organic chemistry (linker and payload). In the latter, total synthesis of natural and designed cytotoxic compounds, together with the development of novel synthetic strategies, have been key aspects of the consecution of clinical ADCs. In the case of payloads from marine origin, impressive structural architectures and biological properties are observed, thus making them prime targets for chemical synthesis and the development of ADCs. In this review, we explore the molecular and biological diversity of ADCs, with particular emphasis on those containing marine cytotoxic drugs as the payload.",

To date, N-Succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylate (SMCC) has been one of the most frequently applied reagents for the preparation of ADC and other functional conjugates. However, SMCC-based conjugates suffer from limited stability in blood circulation and from a hydrophobic character of the linker, which may give rise to major pharmacokinetic implications. To address this issue, we have developed a heterobifunctional analogue of a SMCC reagent, i.e., sodium 4-(maleimidomethyl)-1,3-dioxane-5-carbonyl)oxy)-2,3,5,6- tetrafluorobenzenesulfonate (MDTF) for amine-to-thiol conjugation. By replacing the cyclohexyl ring in the SMCC structure with the 1,3-dioxane, we increased the hydrophilicity of the linker. A FRET probe based on MD linker was prepared and showed superior stability compared to the MCC linker in human plasma, as well as in a variety of aqueous buffers. A detailed investigation demonstrated an accelerated succinimide ring opening for MD linker, resulting in stabilized conjugates. Finally, the MDTF reagent was applied for the preparation of serum stable antibody-dye conjugate.",

            "text": "The current set of ADCs in clinical development use ADC payloads that are attached to protease cleavable, acid labile or non cleavable linkers. These ADC payloads and linkers are covalently attached to the amines on lysines or the thiols on cysteines which results in a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies containing 0 to 8 drugs per antibody [14]. ADCs which contain 8 drugs per antibody are less stable in circulation as compared to ADCs which have a lower number of drugs per antibody. As the number of drugs per antibody decreases, the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC improve [16]. The instability of the ADCs with a higher DAR may result in the systemic release of drug payload, which may be responsible for the non target-related toxicities reported for various ADCs. Therefore the goals for the next generation of ADCs are to reduce the number of drugs per antibody, which will improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC; to improve the stability of the ADC payload, which will reduce the non target related toxicities; and improve the CMC properties of the ADC while maintaining the in vivo anti tumor efficacy and the in vitro cytotoxicity of the ADC. The direct incorporation of the non-natural amino acid, Paraacetyl phenylalanine (pAF) at specific sites on an anti-Her2 antibody, allows for the site specific incorporation of two drugs per antibody [11]. This is similar to what was reported for modified version of T-DM1 (ThioTMab) where the specific incorporation of cysteines into Herceptin resulted in a homogeneous preparation containing 1.8 drugs per antibody [10]. The lack of unconjugated antibody in the preparations offers a distinct advantage over the ADCs where the ADC payload is conjugated to antibody's free cysteine or lysine residues. \n\nThe conjugation chemistry used to attach the drug payload A to pAF generates an oxime bond, which has been reported to be very stable [17].",

This, in turn, significantly influences therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should avoid inducing ADC aggregation, prevent premature payload release in the bloodstream, and facilitate the release of active drugs precisely at the desired target. Linkers are broadly classified into two main types based on cellular metabolism processes [10][11][12][13]: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

The antimitotic and DNA alkylating compound classes tend to have in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) potency values in the nM and pM ranges, respectively. These differences in potency are also reflected in the clinically-achievable maximum tolerated doses for the two payload classes [4]. \n\nLinkers are the most modifiable aspect of an ADC; changes made to linkers can impact the biophysical and functional performance of the entire conjugate for good or bad. Linkers are attached to antibodies using a variety of conjugation approaches that fall into two general categories: those resulting in heterogeneous or in site-specific payload placement. The former tend to exploit the reactivity of endogenous lysine or hinge cysteine residues within the antibody, whereas the latter use reactive chemical handles exogenously introduced into particular locations on the antibody through various means. While the field is coming to appreciate the functional and analytical advantages of employing site-specific conjugation [2], the ADC clinical pipeline is still dominated by heterogeneous conjugates. ADC linkers can be either noncleavable, designed to persist through antibody degradation in the lysosome, or cleavable, designed to be stable in the circulation but readily degraded after internalization by the target cell. The relative stability of various linkers and conjugation chemistries can have a major effect on both efficacy and toxicity [2].",

The antimitotic and DNA alkylating compound classes tend to have in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) potency values in the nM and pM ranges, respectively. These differences in potency are also reflected in the clinically-achievable maximum tolerated doses for the two payload classes [4]. \n\nLinkers are the most modifiable aspect of an ADC; changes made to linkers can impact the biophysical and functional performance of the entire conjugate for good or bad. Linkers are attached to antibodies using a variety of conjugation approaches that fall into two general categories: those resulting in heterogeneous or in site-specific payload placement. The former tend to exploit the reactivity of endogenous lysine or hinge cysteine residues within the antibody, whereas the latter use reactive chemical handles exogenously introduced into particular locations on the antibody through various means. While the field is coming to appreciate the functional and analytical advantages of employing site-specific conjugation [2], the ADC clinical pipeline is still dominated by heterogeneous conjugates. ADC linkers can be either noncleavable, designed to persist through antibody degradation in the lysosome, or cleavable, designed to be stable in the circulation but readily degraded after internalization by the target cell. The relative stability of various linkers and conjugation chemistries can have a major effect on both efficacy and toxicity [2].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), or immunoconjugates aiming to combine the potency of cytotoxic drugs with the high specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), are becoming increasingly important as new targeted therapies in oncology. 1 3][4][5] To construct ADCs, highly potent cytotoxic agents are chemically attached to mAbs specific to tumor-related antigens with cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Depending on the conjugation chemistries, different ADC structures have been developed. The drug payloads may be, for example, randomly attached to surface-exposed lysine residues distributed on both light and heavy chains (average of 80 to 95 per IgG), as illustrated by ado-trastuzumab emtansine. 6 lternatively, site-specific coupling to two or more of the eight cysteine residues involved in inter-chain disulfide bridges of chimeric, humanized or human IgG1 after mild reduction may be used, as illustrated in the case of brentuximab vedotin. 7 For the same purpose, the glycan moiety can be subjected to mild oxidation and used for site-selective conjugation via a hydrazone linkage. 8 As further improvements for the third-generation ADCs, design of optimized antibodies (e.g., engineered to contain free surface-exposed cysteines for a site-specific drug linkage) and drug loading level optimization are investigated to maintain the natural favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) of chimeric, humanized, and human IgGs. Site-specific conjugation to antibodies results in more homogeneous drug loading and avoids ADC subpopulations with altered antigen-binding caused by cross-linking in the CDRs or altered PK caused by cross-linking at Fc domain binding sites of FcRn. ][12] Conjugation of drugs to mAbs increases the structural complexity of the resulting molecule, which triggers the need for improved characterization methods. 13",

            "text": "The site-specific ADC described in this paper is LCB14-0110, an ADC drug developed by LegoChem Biosciences Inc. that develops ADC linkers and toxins via the ConjuALL\u2122 platform technology. LCB14-0110 is currently in phase 1 clinical trials in China and is composed of a payload (MMAF, an inhibitor for tubulin polymerization) attached to HER2-targeting trastuzumab with a CaaX sequence through a novel site-specific conjugation. This novel site-specific conjugation method is comprised of the insertion of the CaaX sequence at the C-terminal of the protein binder, prenylation using farnesyltransferase, and drug conjugation through an oxime ligation reaction [9]. MMAF and trastuzumab are used as the antitumor agent and protein binder, respectively. This site-specific ADC is homogenous and stable [7]. Several bioanalytical approaches for the development of ADCs have been discussed by many researchers [10][11][12]. The bioanalysis of ADCs has many challenges with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) due to their complexity derived from three distinct components-the cytotoxic chemical drug, the linker, and the antibody [13]. There are several major analytes that can be used for the evaluation of ADCs' pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, including free drug and its metabolites, antibody-conjugated drug (acDrug), total antibody (tAb), drug-conjugated antibody, and naked antibody [12]. Among them, acDrug is the active analyte of ADC and is also used to calculate the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) profile, which is known as one of the most critical characteristics in ADC evaluation [14,15]. Conventionally, the bioanalysis for tAb and conjugated antibody has been conducted by ligand-binding assay (LBA) [11,[16][17][18][19].",

We sought to investigate whether Streptavidin-Biotin conjugation may be suitable for the conjugation of small molecule payloads typically used for ADC development. \n\nToxins for ADC development often contain reactive groups such as amines or thiols that are used for conjugation to antibodies via specific linkers. We evaluated two examples of generating ADCs by Streptavidin-Biotin conjugation with small molecule payloads. We biotinylated two types of toxins presenting primary amine or thiol reactive groups (B-Drug) and we conjugated these to streptavidin-linked antibodies (Antibody-S) to produce Antibody-SB-Drug conjugates in as little as 7 hours (Fig. 2a). We then tested efficacy and safety by investigating tumour and non-malignant cell viability with ADC, naked antibody or payload only treatment. \n\nFirstly, an ADC composed of trastuzumab and DM1 (Trastuzumab-SB-DM1) biotinylated via the thiol group of DM1 was tested in parallel with the clinically used trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) consisting of DM1 and trastuzumab but linked via mcc-maleimide linking 13 . To mimic the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of the clinically available T-DM1, we conjugated Trastuzumab-SB-DM1 using a molar ratio of 3.5 molecules of DM1 per one trastuzumab antibody 14 . We demonstrated similar binding kinetics of Trastuzumab-SB-DM1 compared with clinically available naked antibody trastuzumab as well as with T-DM1, with 50% of the maximal mean florescence intensity reached at 50 nM (Trastuzumab-SB-DM1), 17 nM (trastuzumab) and 22 nM (T-DM1) (Fig. 2b).",

We sought to investigate whether Streptavidin-Biotin conjugation may be suitable for the conjugation of small molecule payloads typically used for ADC development. \n\nToxins for ADC development often contain reactive groups such as amines or thiols that are used for conjugation to antibodies via specific linkers. We evaluated two examples of generating ADCs by Streptavidin-Biotin conjugation with small molecule payloads. We biotinylated two types of toxins presenting primary amine or thiol reactive groups (B-Drug) and we conjugated these to streptavidin-linked antibodies (Antibody-S) to produce Antibody-SB-Drug conjugates in as little as 7 hours (Fig. 2a). We then tested efficacy and safety by investigating tumour and non-malignant cell viability with ADC, naked antibody or payload only treatment. \n\nFirstly, an ADC composed of trastuzumab and DM1 (Trastuzumab-SB-DM1) biotinylated via the thiol group of DM1 was tested in parallel with the clinically used trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) consisting of DM1 and trastuzumab but linked via mcc-maleimide linking 13 . To mimic the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of the clinically available T-DM1, we conjugated Trastuzumab-SB-DM1 using a molar ratio of 3.5 molecules of DM1 per one trastuzumab antibody 14 . We demonstrated similar binding kinetics of Trastuzumab-SB-DM1 compared with clinically available naked antibody trastuzumab as well as with T-DM1, with 50% of the maximal mean florescence intensity reached at 50 nM (Trastuzumab-SB-DM1), 17 nM (trastuzumab) and 22 nM (T-DM1) (Fig. 2b).",

            "text": "ntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), as a new tool in targeted therapy of cancer, are composed of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) conjugated to highly toxic small molecule agents (payloads) through small chemical linkers [1,2] . ADCs bring together the targeting advantages of mAbs with the cytotoxic potential of small molecule payloads to enhance specific drug delivery in tumor cells, while sparing healthy tissue and/or cells [3][4][5] . Methods employed to construct ADCs are generally classified into two broad categories: random modification of mAb amino acid residues and highly regioselective modification [6] . Random modifications of mAbs, despite acceptable biological and functional properties, may impair antigen binding and lead to conjugate heterogeneity. In contrast, selective modification methods have the ability to control the location and stoichiometry of conjugation, resulting in significantly improved mAb conjugates [6] . Reduction/alkylation of solvent-exposed disulfides, as a reliable and robust regioselective strategy, leads to the production of free sulfhydryl groups, allowing for conjugation at specific residues using suitable linkers [7][8][9] . The process typically involves the reduction of interchain disulfides with dithiothreitol (DTT) or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and subsequent modification of the resulting thiols (-SH groups) with thiol-specific maleimide-containing linker-payloads [6] . The exact number of payloads per A antibody is determined by the extent of disulfide reduction. Full reduction of all four interchain disulfide bonds yields a homogeneous construct with eight drugs per antibody, while a partial reduction results in a heterogeneous mixture with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 drugs per antibody [10] .\n\nGiven the above, it is not surprising that antibody reduction plays a vital role in the development of disulfide-based ADCs. Optimization of antibody reduction methods can improve a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), drug load distribution/location, and ADC functionality. The purpose of this study was",

This methodology, termed \u201cAJICAP\u201d, successfully modified Lys248 of native antibodies to produce site-specific ADC with a wider therapeutic index than the Food and Drug Administration-approved ADC, Kadcyla.

In this manuscript, we aimed to present an updated Fc-affinity-mediated site-specific conjugation technology named \u201cAJICAP second generation\u201d without redox treatment utilizing a \u201cone-pot\u201d antibody modification reaction. The stability of Fc affinity reagents was improved owing to structural optimization, enabling the production of various ADCs without aggregation. In addition to Lys248 conjugation, Lys288 conjugated ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratio of 2 were produced using different Fc affinity peptide reagent possessing a proper spacer linkage. These two conjugation technologies were used to produce over 20 ADCs from several combinations of antibodies and drug linkers. The in vivo profile of Lys248 and Lys288 conjugated ADCs was also compared. Furthermore, nontraditional ADC production, such as antibody\u2013protein conjugates and antibody\u2013oligonucleotide conjugates, were achieved. These results strongly indicate that this Fc affinity conjugation approach is a promising strategy for manufacturing site-specific antibody conjugates without antibody engineering.",

This workflow benefits from a recently developed icIEF system that is MS\u2010friendly and capable of directly coupling to a high\u2010sensitivity MS instrument. Results show that the icIEF separation is influenced by both drug payloads and the post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs), which are then promptly identified by MS.

Although endosomes have been proposed to process cleavable ADCs, the precise identity of the relevant compartments and their relative contributions to ADC processing remain undefined. Here we show that a METxMET biparatopic antibody internalizes into sorting endosomes, rapidly traffics to recycling endosomes, and slowly reaches late endosomes. In agreement with the current model of ADC trafficking, late endosomes are the primary processing site of MET, EGFR, and prolactin receptor ADCs. Interestingly, recycling endosomes contribute up to 35% processing of the MET and EGFR ADCs in different cancer cells, mediated by cathepsin-L, which localizes to this compartment. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the relationship between transendosomal trafficking and ADC processing and suggest that receptors that traffic through recycling endosomes might be suitable targets for cleavable ADCs.",

Here, the authors develop a HER2-targeted ADC (DHES0815A) with a reduced potency PBD payload that demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy and nonhuman primate tolerability, but culminated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer which was terminated due to toxicity. Approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for HER2-positive breast cancer include trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan. To develop a differentiated HER2 ADC, we chose an antibody that does not compete with trastuzumab or pertuzumab for binding, conjugated to a reduced potency PBD (pyrrolobenzodiazepine) dimer payload. PBDs are potent cytotoxic agents that alkylate and cross-link DNA. In our study, the PBD dimer is modified to alkylate, but not cross-link DNA.

Here, the authors develop a HER2-targeted ADC (DHES0815A) with a reduced potency PBD payload that demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy and nonhuman primate tolerability, but culminated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer which was terminated due to toxicity. Approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for HER2-positive breast cancer include trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan. To develop a differentiated HER2 ADC, we chose an antibody that does not compete with trastuzumab or pertuzumab for binding, conjugated to a reduced potency PBD (pyrrolobenzodiazepine) dimer payload. PBDs are potent cytotoxic agents that alkylate and cross-link DNA. In our study, the PBD dimer is modified to alkylate, but not cross-link DNA.

It also contributes to resistance against chemotherapeutic agents, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors, by upregulating AXL signaling or switching oncogenic pathways. These factors make AXL an attractive therapeutic target. However, early attempts with naked antibody therapies failed due to the high doses need for efficacy, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting AXL were hindered by off-tumor toxicities due to its expression on normal tissues. Methods To address these issues, we developed a novel, conditionally active biologic ADC, mecbotamab vedotin (BA3011), which selectively binds to AXL in the acidic tumor microenvironment. In healthy tissue, binding to AXL is substantially diminished due to a powerful selection mechanism utilizing naturally occurring, physiological chemicals referred to as Protein-associated Chemical Switches. BA3011 was tested in vitro and in vivo against AXL expressing cancer cells. Results Mecbotamab vedotin demonstrates the expected AXL, tumor-specific binding properties and effectively induced lysis of AXL-positive cancer cell lines in vitro. In vivo, mecbotamab vedotin exhibited potent and lasting antitumor effects in human cancer xenograft mouse models. Furthermore, in nonhuman primates, mecbotamab vedotin demonstrated excellent tolerability at doses of up to 5 mg/kg and maintained linker-payload stability in vivo. Conclusions These findings indicate that mecbotamab vedotin has the potential to be a robust and less toxic therapeutic agent, offering promise as a treatment for patients with AXL-positive cancers.",

Mechanisms of resistance include secondary mutations of EGFR and cMET and other downstream oncogenic pathways such as KRAS and amplification of alternate growth factor receptors. MET amplification or protein overexpression has been established as the most common mechanism of clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as osimertinib. AZD9592 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC designed to target EGFR and cMET, while overcoming pathway-mediated resistance mechanisms that limit other targeted agents. Here we describe the generation, characterization and preclinical evaluation of AZD9592. The ADC was constructed on the backbone of the clinically validated DuetMab monovalent bispecific IgG platform and was engineered with higher affinity for cMET compared to EGFR (>15 fold), with the aim of reducing EGFR-driven toxicity in normal tissues. The antibody is conjugated via a cleavable linker to a proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload (AZ14170132). The internalization and in vitro cytotoxicity (IC50 in the low nM range) of AZD9592 were found to be optimal when both EGFR and cMET were engaged. When EGFR alone was engaged, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced, consistent with the lower affinity for EGFR. Treatment of cells with AZD9592 induced multiple DNA damage response pathway markers (like ATM, ATR, \u03b3\u03972\u0391X), consistent with the proposed primary mechanism of action (MOA) of direct tumor-cell killing caused by double strand DNA breaks. AZD9592 monotherapy showed activity in vivo in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing multiple EGFR and cMET expressing tumor types, including both EGFR mutant (m) and wild-type NSCLC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Responses (\u226530% regression from baseline tumor volume) were observed across a wide range of clinically relevant dose levels, including a 41% response rate in EGFRm NSCLC tumors treated at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg/kg. AZD9592 combined with osimertinib also showed benefit in PDX models derived from patients who progressed on osimertinib alone, as well as models representing primary resistance (EGFR ex20ins). AZD9592 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys over a 6-week period (dosing every 3 weeks). The key safety findings were limited hematological effects, consistent with the MOA of the TOP1i payload. Plasma pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys showed an acceptable profile at tolerated doses, in line with other EGFR and cMET directed antibodies. These results demonstrate that AZD9592 has a promising efficacy and safety profile in preclinical models representing diverse opportunities in multiple clinical settings.\n Citation Format: Frank Comer, Yariv Mazor, Elaine Hurt, Chunning Yang, Ryan Fleming, Harini Shandilya, Balakumar Vijayakrishnan, Meghan Sterba, Ruoyan Chen, Edward Rosfjord, Nicolas Floch, Anton I.

            "abstract": "Despite emerging targeted and immunotherapy treatments, no monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directly targeting tumor cells are currently approved for melanoma therapy. The tumor-associated antigen chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), a neural crest glycoprotein over-expressed on 70% of melanomas, contributes to proliferative signaling pathways, but despite highly tumor-selective expression it has not yet been targeted using ADCs. We developed a novel ADC comprising an anti-CSPG4 antibody linked to a DNA minor groove-binding agent belonging to the novel pyrridinobenzodiazepine (PDD) class. Unlike conventional DNA-interactive pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer payloads that cross-link DNA, PDD-based payloads are mono-alkylating agents but have similar efficacy and substantially enhanced tolerability profiles compared to PBD-based cross-linkers. We investigated the anti-tumor activity and safety of the anti-CSPG4-(PDD) ADC in vitro and in human melanoma xenografts. Anti-CSPG4-(PDD) inhibited CSPG4-expressing melanoma cell growth and colony formation and triggered apoptosis in vitro at low nanomolar to picomolar concentrations without off-target Fab-mediated or Fc-mediated toxicity. Anti-CSPG4-(PDD) restricted xenograft growth in vivo at 2 mg/kg doses. One 5 mg/kg injection triggered tumor regression in the absence of overt toxic effects or of acquired residual tumor cell resistance. This anti-CSPG4-(PDD) can deliver a highly cytotoxic DNA mono-alkylating payload to CSPG4-expressing tumors at doses tolerated in vivo.",

            "text": "Despite emerging targeted and immunotherapy treatments, no monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directly targeting tumor cells are currently approved for melanoma therapy. The tumor-associated antigen chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), a neural crest glycoprotein over-expressed on 70% of melanomas, contributes to proliferative signaling pathways, but despite highly tumor-selective expression it has not yet been targeted using ADCs. We developed a novel ADC comprising an anti-CSPG4 antibody linked to a DNA minor groove-binding agent belonging to the novel pyrridinobenzodiazepine (PDD) class.

This technology has been successfully applied to continuous-flow manufacturing, marking the first achievement in site-selective ADC production. This manuscript outlines AJICAP-M's methodology and its effectiveness in ADC production.",

A series of MAC \u03b2-glucuronide model constructs were prepared to evaluate stability and enzymatic release, and the results demonstrated high stability at physiological pH in a substitution-dependent manner. All the MAC model compounds efficiently released alcohol drug surrogates under the action of \u03b2-glucuronidase. To assess the MAC technology for ADCs, the potent microtubule-disrupting agent auristatin\u2005E (AE) was incorporated through the norephedrine alcohol. Conjugation of the MAC \u03b2-glucuronide AE drug linker to the anti-CD30 antibody cAC10, and an IgG control antibody, gave potent and immunologically specific activities in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo. These studies validate the MAC self-immolative unit for alcohol-containing payloads within ADCs, a class that has not been widely exploited."

                "snippets": "Acid-labile hydrazone linkers are designed to be stable within the neutral pH extracellular environment, but become cleaved within the low pH environment of intracellular endosome and lysosome compartments. (Polson et al., 2009) Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). (Doronina et al., 2003) Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. (Doronina et al., 2003) Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. (Kovtun et al., 2006) DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner.",

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans."

Antibodies that specifically bind tumor surface antigens can be effective therapeutics; however, many unmodified antibodies lack therapeutic activity. These antibodies can instead be applied successfully as guided missiles to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs in the form of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). The success of ADCs is dependent on four factors\u2014target antigen, antibody, linker, and payload. The field has made great progress in these areas, marked by the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of two ADCs, brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u00ae) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla\u00ae). However, the therapeutic window for many ADCs that are currently in pre-clinical or clinical development remains narrow and further improvements may be required to enhance the therapeutic potential of these ADCs. Production of ADCs is an area where improvement is needed because current methods yield heterogeneous mixtures that may include 0\u20138 drug species per antibody molecule. Site-specific conjugation has been recently shown to eliminate heterogeneity, improve conjugate stability, and increase the therapeutic window. Here, we review and describe various site-specific conjugation strategies that are currently used for the production of ADCs, including use of engineered cysteine residues, unnatural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation through glycotransferases and transglutaminases. In addition, we also summarize differences among these methods and highlight critical considerations when building next-generation ADC therapeutics.",

For maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. In this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. The amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mAb carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. Here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether ADCs. One such ADC, 1F6-C4v2-bac-MMAF, which is directed against the CD70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (MMAF) and the mAb carrier (1F6-C4v2). There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. The mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-Michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. In summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting ADCs had similar tolerability and activity profiles.",

With advances in the fields of bioorthogonal chemistry and protein engineering, there is growing interest in producing ADCs by site-specific conjugation to the antibody, yielding more homogeneous products that have demonstrated benefits over their heterogeneous counterparts in vivo.

Despite previous extensive efforts for improving conjugation efficiency and ADC homogeneity, most ADC linkers developed to date load only single payloads. Branched linkers that can load multiple payload molecules have yet to be fully explored. It is logical to envisage that a multi-loading strategy allows for increase in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) with less chemical or enzymatic modification to the antibody structure compared to traditional linear linkers, leading to efficient ADC construction, minimal destabilization of the antibody structure, and enhanced ADC efficacy. Herein, we report that the branched linkers we designed can be quantitatively installed on an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase)-mediated conjugation without impairing its antigen binding affinity, enabling modular installation of payload molecules and construction of homogeneous ADCs with increased DARs (up to 8). An anti-HER2 antibody-monomethyl auristatin F conjugate constructed using our branched linkers showed greater in vitro cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines than that consisting of linear linkers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the branched linker-based payload delivery. Our finding demonstrates that enzymatic ADC construction using branched linkers is a promising strategy, which may lead to innovative cancer therapeutics.",

In particular, significant unmet medical needs exist for effective treatment strategies for acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) and acute monocytic leukemia (M5) AML subtypes. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) are a promising drug class for AML therapy, as demonstrated by the FDA-approved anti-CD33 ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg). However, CD33 is expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells, highlighting the critical need to identify AML-specific targets to minimize the risk of potential adverse effects. We have demonstrated that the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B4 (LILRB4) is expressed at significantly higher levels on monocytic M4 and M5 AML cells than on normal counterparts. Here, we test whether LILRB4 is a promising ADC target to kill monocytic AML cells while sparing healthy counterparts. To this end, we generated ADCs from a humanized anti-LILRB4 mAb and the antimitotic payload, monomethyl auristatin F. The conjugates constructed were characterized and evaluated for LILRB4-specific cell killing potency, toxicity to progenitor cells, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy. Our ADC linker technology platform efficiently generated homogeneous anti-LILRB4 ADCs with defined drug-to-antibody ratios. The homogeneous anti-LILRB4 ADCs demonstrated the capacity for LILRB4-mediated internalization, suitable physicochemical properties, and high cell killing potency against LILRB4-positive AML cells. Importantly, our data indicate that these ADCs spare normal progenitor cells. One of our homogeneous conjugates exerted a remarkable therapeutic effect and no significant toxicity in a xenograft mouse model of disseminated human AML. Our findings highlight the clinical potential of anti-LILRB4 ADCs in monocytic AML therapy."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

However, recent work on an ADC that targets fibronectin in the tumor microenvironment suggests this may not be necessary. The alternatively spliced extra domains A and B (EDA and EDB) of fibronectin offer appealing targets for ADC development, because the antigen is strongly expressed in many solid human tumors and nearly undetectable in normal tissues except for the female reproductive system. In this study, we describe the properties of a set of ADCs based on an antibody targeting the alternatively spliced EDA of fibronectin coupled to one of a set of potent cytotoxic drugs (DM1 or one of two duocarmycin derivatives). The DM1 conjugate SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 mediated potent antitumor activity in mice bearing DM1-sensitive F9 tumors but not DM1-insensitive CT26 tumors. Quantitative biodistribution studies and microscopic analyses confirmed a preferential accumulation of SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of tumors, similar to the pattern observed for unmodified antibody. Notably, we found that treatments were well tolerated at efficacious doses that were fully curative and compatible with pharmaceutical development. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept for curative ADC targeting the tumor microenvironment that do not rely upon antigen internalization."

This study characterized the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, potential biomarkers, and antitumor activity of DLYE5953A in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients and Methods: This was a phase I, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of DLYE5953A administered intravenously every 21 days (Q3W) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. Results: Sixty-eight patients received DLYE5953A (median, four cycles; range, 1\u201327). No dose-limiting toxicities were identified during dose escalation (0.2\u20132.4 mg/kg; n = 20). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 2.4 mg/kg Q3W was based on overall safety and tolerability. Dose-expansion cohorts for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (HER2-negative MBC; n = 23) and non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 25) patients were enrolled at the RP2D. Among patients receiving DLYE5953A 2.4 mg/kg (n = 55), the most common (\u226530%) related adverse events (AEs) included alopecia, fatigue, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. Grade \u22653 related AEs occurred in 14 of 55 (26%) patients, with neutropenia being the most common (13%). DLYE5953A demonstrated linear total antibody pharmacokinetics at doses of \u22650.8 mg/kg with low unconjugated monomethyl auristatin E levels in blood. Partial response was confirmed in eight of 68 (12%) patients, including three of 29 patients with MBC (10%) and five of 25 patients with NSCLC (20%) at the RP2D. Stable disease was the best response for 37 of 68 (54%) patients. Conclusions: DLYE5953A administered at 2.4 mg/kg has acceptable safety.

The main idea is to generate bi or tri-functionalized linkers, in which orthogonal reactions allow the incorporation of different payloads using covalent bonds (Levengood et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2018;Zhang L. et al., 2021;Yamazaki et al., 2021). Levengood et al. (2017) prepared a linker with sequential Cys residues with orthogonal protection to enable site-specific conjugation of each drug and conjugated to IgG1 through the reduced interchain disulfides of the antibody and stable maleimide linkage. In 2018, a novel heterotrifunctional linker was developed by Kumar et al. (2018), providing a flexible platform that allows the coupling of two different drugs via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and via oxime linkage using ketone as starting functional group, but also the conjugation to the antibody through cysteine-maleimide reaction."

Paradoxically, however, these tools for precision medicine are synthesized in a remarkably imprecise way. Indeed, the vast majority of immunoconjugates are created via the random conjugation of bifunctional probes (e.g., DOTA-NCS) to amino acids within the antibody (e.g., lysines). Yet antibodies have multiple copies of these residues throughout their macromolecular structure, making control over the location of the conjugation reaction impossible. This lack of site specificity can lead to the formation of poorly defined, heterogeneous immunoconjugates with suboptimal in vivo behavior. Over the past decade, interest in the synthesis and development of site-specifically labeled immunoconjugates\u2014both antibody-drug conjugates as well as constructs for in vivo imaging\u2014has increased dramatically, and a number of reports have suggested that these better defined, more homogeneous constructs exhibit improved performance in vivo compared to their randomly modified cousins.

Despite previous extensive efforts for improving conjugation efficiency and ADC homogeneity, most ADC linkers developed to date load only single payloads. Branched linkers that can load multiple payload molecules have yet to be fully explored. It is logical to envisage that a multi-loading strategy allows for increase in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) with less chemical or enzymatic modification to the antibody structure compared to traditional linear linkers, leading to efficient ADC construction, minimal destabilization of the antibody structure, and enhanced ADC efficacy. Herein, we report that the branched linkers we designed can be quantitatively installed on an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase)-mediated conjugation without impairing its antigen binding affinity, enabling modular installation of payload molecules and construction of homogeneous ADCs with increased DARs (up to 8). An anti-HER2 antibody-monomethyl auristatin F conjugate constructed using our branched linkers showed greater in vitro cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines than that consisting of linear linkers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the branched linker-based payload delivery.

We demonstrate the utility of this probe to study disulfide reduction during HER2 receptor-mediated uptake of a Cys-engineered anti-HER2 THIOMAB\u2122 antibody. We found that introduction of positive, but not negative, charges in the probe improved retention of the BODIPY catabolite. This permitted observation of significant disulfide cleavage in endosomes or lysosomes on par with proteolytic cleavage of a similarly-charged valine-citrulline peptide-based probe. In general, the FRET probe we describe should enable real-time cellular monitoring of disulfide cleavage in other targeted delivery systems for mechanistic or diagnostic applications. Furthermore, modifications to the released BODIPY moiety permit determination of factors that allow lysosomal egress or retention, which may have implications for the development of next-generation antibody-drug conjugates.",

These regimens improve treatment outcomes and slow development of drug resistance. We here report the generation of an ADC with a dual-drug payload that combines two distinct mechanisms of action. Methods Virtual DNA crosslinking agent PNU-159682 and tubulin polymerization inhibitor monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) were conjugated to a HER2-targeting antibody via site-specific conjugation at engineered selenocysteine and cysteine residues (thio-selenomab). Results The dual-drug ADC showed selective and potent cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing cell lines and exhibited dual mechanisms of action consistent with the attached drugs. While PNU-159682 caused S-phase cell cycle arrest due to its DNA-damaging activity, MMAF simultaneously inhibited tubulin polymerization and caused G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest. Conclusion The thio-selenomab platform enables the assembly of dual-drug ADCs with two distinct mechanisms of action.",

The most frequent labelling technique to generate antibody\u2013fluorophore conjugates (AFCs) involves the bioconjugation onto the mAb lysines of a dye bearing an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or an isothiocyanate group. However, discrepancies between labelling experiments or kits can be observed, related to reproducibility issues, alteration of antigen binding, or mAb properties. The lack of information on labelling kits and the incomplete characterization of the obtained labelled mAbs largely contribute to these issues. In this work, we generated eight AFCs through either lysine or interchain cysteine cross-linking bioconjugation of green-emitting fluorophores (fluorescein or BODIPY) onto either trastuzumab or rituximab. This strategy allowed us to study the influence of fluorophore solubility, bioconjugation technology, and antibody nature on two known labelling procedures. The structures of these AFCs were thoroughly analyzed by mass spectroscopy, and their antigen binding properties were studied. We then compared these AFCs in vitro by studying their respective spectral properties and stabilities. The shelf stability profiles and sensibility to pH variation of these AFCs prove to be dye-, antibody- and labelling-technology-dependent. Fluorescence emission in AFCs was higher when lysine labelling was used, but cross-linked AFCs were revealed to be more stable. This must be taken into account for the design of any biological study involving antibody labelling.",

They have garnered widespread interest in drug discovery, particularly in oncology, as discrimination between healthy and malignant tissues or cells can be achieved. Nine ADCs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 80 others are currently undergoing clinical investigations for a range of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Extensive research over the past decade has highlighted the critical nature of the linkage strategy adopted to attach the payload to the antibody. Whilst early generation ADCs were primarily synthesised as heterogeneous mixtures, these were found to have sub-optimal pharmacokinetics, stability, tolerability and/or efficacy. Efforts have now shifted towards generating homogeneous constructs with precise drug loading and predetermined, controlled sites of attachment. Homogeneous ADCs have repeatedly demonstrated superior overall pharmacological profiles compared to their heterogeneous counterparts. A wide range of methods have been developed in the pursuit of homogeneity, comprising chemical or enzymatic methods or a combination thereof to afford precise modification of specific amino acid or sugar residues. In this review, we discuss advances in chemical and enzymatic methods for site-specific antibody modification that result in the generation of homogeneous ADCs.",

Several components of an ADC including the selection of the antibody, the linker, the cytotoxic drug payload and the site of attachment used to attach the drug to the antibody are critical to the activity and development of the ADC. The cytotoxic drugs or payloads used to make ADCs are typically conjugated to the antibody through cysteine or lysine residues. This results in ADCs that have a heterogeneous number of drugs per antibody. The number of drugs per antibody commonly referred to as the drug to antibody ratio (DAR), can vary between 0 and 8 drugs for a IgG1 antibody. Antibodies with 0 drugs are ineffective and compete with the ADC for binding to the antigen expressing cells. Antibodies with 8 drugs per antibody have reduced in vivo stability, which may contribute to non target related toxicities. In these studies we incorporated a non-natural amino acid, para acetyl phenylalanine, at two unique sites within an antibody against Her2/neu. We covalently attached a cytotoxic drug to these sites to form an ADC which contains two drugs per antibody. We report the results from the first direct preclinical comparison of a site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADC and a cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADC. We report that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs have superior in vitro serum stability and preclinical toxicology profile in rats as compared to the cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADCs. We also demonstrate that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs maintain their in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy against Her2 expressing human tumor cell lines.

The mutant protein was selectively and efficiently conjugated to an auristatin derivative through a stable oxime linkage. The resulting conjugates demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetics, potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against Her2+ cancer cells, and complete tumor regression in rodent xenograft treatment models.

Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect.

Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156]."

Nine ADCs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 80 others are currently undergoing clinical investigations for a range of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Extensive research over the past decade has highlighted the critical nature of the linkage strategy adopted to attach the payload to the antibody. Whilst early generation ADCs were primarily synthesised as heterogeneous mixtures, these were found to have sub-optimal pharmacokinetics, stability, tolerability and/or efficacy. Efforts have now shifted towards generating homogeneous constructs with precise drug loading and predetermined, controlled sites of attachment. Homogeneous ADCs have repeatedly demonstrated superior overall pharmacological profiles compared to their heterogeneous counterparts. A wide range of methods have been developed in the pursuit of homogeneity, comprising chemical or enzymatic methods or a combination thereof to afford precise modification of specific amino acid or sugar residues. In this review, we discuss advances in chemical and enzymatic methods for site-specific antibody modification that result in the generation of homogeneous ADCs."

Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs."

Here, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key features revolving around ADC therapeutic strategy including their structural and targeting properties, mechanism of action, the role of the tumor microenvironment and review the approved ADCs in clinical oncology, providing discussion regarding their toxicity profile, clinical manifestations and use in novel combination therapies. Finally, we briefly review ADCs in other pathological contexts and provide key information regarding ADC manufacturing and analytical characterization."

Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models.

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003)(Erickson et al., 2006)Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ).

In a phase II study of Mylotarg (CMA-676, gemtuzumab ozogamicin), which consists of a CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, saturation and internalization by leukemic and normal myeloid cells were analyzed in 122 patients with relapsed AML. Peripheral blood samples were obtained just before and 3 and 6 hours after the start of the first and second Mylotarg treatment cycles. Within 3 to 6 hours after infusion, near complete saturation of CD33 antigenic sites by Mylotarg was reached for AML blasts, monocytes, and granulocytes, whereas Mylotarg did not bind to lymphocytes. Saturation levels prior to the start of the second Mylotarg treatment cycle were significantly increased compared with background levels before the start of the first cycle. This apparently was caused by remaining circulating Mylotarg from the first treatment cycle (approximately 2 weeks earlier). On binding of Mylotarg to the CD33 antigen, Mylotarg was rapidly internalized, as determined by the decrease in maximal surface membrane Mylotarg binding. Internalization of Mylotarg was also demonstrated in myeloid cells in vitro and was confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. In vitro studies using pulse labeling with Mylotarg showed a continuous renewed membrane expression of CD33 antigens, which can significantly increase the internalization process and thereby the intracellular accumulation of the drug. Finally, Mylotarg induced dose-dependent apoptosis in myeloid cells in vitro. These data indicate that Mylotarg is rapidly and specifically targeted to CD33(+) cells, followed by internalization and subsequent induction of cell death.",

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (Velden et al., 2001)(Kolfschoten et al., 2007). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003)(Erickson et al., 2006)Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency."

Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs."

ADCs are currently produced by chemical conjugation of a small-molecule toxin to the mAb through lysine or cysteine side chains. This leads to heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs in which variable numbers of drugs are conjugated to individual antibodies and in which the site of conjugation cannot be defined. Consequently, there is currently significant interest in further development of drug conjugation technologies, with a particular focus on site-specific payload conjugation. Here, we present an enzymatic conjugation platform based on the S. aureus sortase A-mediated transpeptidation reaction, allowing the efficient generation of ADCs with toxins conjugated to pre-defined sites at pre-defined drug-to-antibody ratios. For this, two modifications were introduced: first, immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains were modified at their C-termini by addition of the sortase A recognition motif LPETG, and second, the small molecule tubulin polymerization inhibitors monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and maytansine were modified by addition of a pentaglycine peptide, thus making them suitable substrates for sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. We demonstrate efficient generation and characterization of the anti-CD30 ADC Ac10-vcPAB-MMAE, an enzymatically conjugated counterpart of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), as well as several anti-HER-2 ADCs including trastuzumab-maytansine, the counterpart of trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla). ADCs generated in this manner were found to display in vitro cell killing activities indistinguishable from the classic conjugates. Further, when tested in vivo in a HER-2-overexpressing ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model, enzymatically generated trastuzumab-maytansine was found to lead to complete regression of established tumors, similar to Kadcyla.",

Site-specific payload placement allows for control over both the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and the conjugation site, both of which play an important role in governing the pharmacokinetics (PK), disposition, and efficacy of the ADC. In addition to the DAR and site of conjugation, linker composition also plays an important role in the properties of an ADC. We have previously reported a novel site-specific conjugation platform comprising linker payloads designed to selectively react with site-specifically engineered aldehyde tags on an antibody backbone. This chemistry results in a stable C\u2013C bond between the antibody and the cytotoxin payload, providing a uniquely stable connection with respect to the other linker chemistries used to generate ADCs. The flexibility and versatility of the aldehyde tag conjugation platform has enabled us to undertake a systematic evaluation of the impact of conjugation site and linker composition on ADC properties. Here, we describe the production and characterization of a panel of ADCs bearing the aldehyde tag at different locations on an IgG1 backbone conjugated using Hydrazino-iso-Pictet-Spengler (HIPS) chemistry. We demonstrate that in a panel of ADCs with aldehyde tags at different locations, the site of conjugation has a dramatic impact on in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior in rodents; this advantage translates to an improved safety profile in rats as compared to a conventional lysine conjugate.",

Dual\u2010auristatin ADCs imparted activity in cell line and xenograft models that are refractory to ADCs comprised of the individual auristatin components.

I should start with an \"Introduction/Background\" section to explain what ADC linkers are and why they're important. This will provide necessary context for readers who may not be familiar with ADCs.\n\n2. The quotes extensively discuss different types of linkers - particularly \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\" linkers - which is a major categorization. This should be a primary dimension.\n\n3. There's significant content about specific conjugation chemistry methods - how the linkers are actually attached to antibodies. This is a key chemical methodology aspect.\n\n4. Several quotes mention novel or emerging linker technologies that address limitations of traditional approaches. This would make for an important dimension.\n\n5. Many quotes discuss linker design considerations and how they affect ADC performance. This would be helpful to include.\n\nLet me organize the dimensions in a logical order:\n\n1. \"Introduction to ADC Linkers\" - This should be a synthesis paragraph explaining what ADC linkers are, their role, and why they're important to ADC efficacy and safety.\n\n2. \"Types of ADC Linkers: Cleavable vs. Non-Cleavable\" - This should be a synthesis section explaining the fundamental differences between these two major categories of linkers.\n\n3. \"Conjugation Chemistry Methods\" - This should be a list format dimension explaining the various chemical approaches used to attach drugs to antibodies.\n\n4. \"Novel Linker Technologies\" - This should be a list of emerging or improved linker approaches that address limitations of traditional methods.\n\n5. \"Design Considerations for ADC Linkers\" - This should be a synthesis paragraph about factors that influence linker selection and design.\n\nThe format choice for each dimension is based on the nature of the content. For factual, distinct items like conjugation methods and novel technologies, a list format makes information more accessible. For conceptual explanations that require connecting ideas, synthesis paragraphs are more appropriate.",

The linker component in ADCs serves as the critical bridge between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload. \n\nThe synthesis of ADC linkers involves specialized chemical methodologies designed to create covalent bonds between the antibody and the drug. These linkers must be carefully engineered to maintain stability in circulation while enabling efficient drug release at the target site. Typical chemical approaches include maleimide chemistry targeting cysteine residues, activated esters for lysine conjugation, and click chemistry methods such as copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).\n\nLinker synthesis must account for the physiological environment where the ADC will function, including plasma stability, endosomal pH conditions, and the presence of specific enzymes at target sites. The chemical composition of linkers typically incorporates functional groups that facilitate conjugation while maintaining the structural integrity of both the antibody and the drug payload. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nADC linkers are broadly classified into two main categories based on their drug release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"17562819\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"270427294\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This classification is fundamental to understanding the diverse chemical methodologies employed in ADC development.\n\n## Cleavable Linkers\n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation but release their cytotoxic payload upon exposure to specific conditions found in the tumor microenvironment or within cancer cells <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. These linkers are further subdivided based on their specific cleavage mechanisms:\n\n1. **Acid-labile linkers**: These linkers, such as hydrazones, remain stable at neutral blood pH but undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of endosomes and lysosomes (pH 4-6) <Paper corpusId=\"17456785\" paperTitle=\"(Ritchie et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"392811\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct.

Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice."

(Polson et al., 2009) Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). (Doronina et al., 2003) Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. (Doronina et al., 2003) Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. (Kovtun et al., 2006) DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63"

These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (Velden et al., 2001)(Kolfschoten et al., 2007). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003)(Erickson et al., 2006)Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect (Fu et al., 2022)(Dumontet et al., 2023)(Tarantino et al., 2023)(Drago et al., 2021)(Beck et al., 2017)(Matsumura et al., 1986)(Matsumura, 2014)(Joubert et al., 2020)(Riccardi et al., 2023)(Jin et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45]."

                            "Not only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior (Lyon et al., 2015). Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes."

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs."

CD22 is not expressed on hematopoietic progenitors of the B-lymphoid lineage. CD22 efficiently internalizes upon binding to an antibody making it an ideal candidate for targeted drug delivery. Targeting malignant B-cells through CD22 by the CD22 specific antibody G5/44 could, therefore, be an efficient way to deliver calicheamicin to destroy malignant B-cells."

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans."

                "text": "\n## Conventional Conjugation Methods\n\n### Lysine-Based Conjugation\nOne of the most common approaches for creating ADCs involves targeting the \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues on the antibody surface <Paper corpusId=\"1549757\" paperTitle=\"(Firer et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261526017\" paperTitle=\"(Parslow et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This method typically employs activated esters such as N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that react with lysines to form stable amide bonds <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. While lysine conjugation yields high-producing ADCs, the abundance of lysine residues (approximately 80 per IgG) results in heterogeneous products with variable drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), potentially affecting antigen binding when modification occurs in or near the antigen-binding domain <Paper corpusId=\"257451749\" paperTitle=\"(Sapozhnikova et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236959766\" paperTitle=\"(Witting et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n### Cysteine-Based Conjugation\nThe second major conventional approach targets cysteine residues, typically by reducing interchain disulfide bonds to generate reactive thiols <Paper corpusId=\"18646779\" paperTitle=\"(Beerli et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261526017\" paperTitle=\"(Parslow et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. The presence of four interchain disulfide bridges in IgG antibodies provides up to eight possible conjugation sites <Paper corpusId=\"20997961\" paperTitle=\"(Vasigala, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Common reagents for reduction include tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) or dithiothreitol (DTT) <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Maleimide chemistry is frequently employed to react with these free thiols, creating thioether linkages <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, maleimide-based linkers have shown instability in human serum due to potential retro-Michael reactions with cysteine-34 in human serum albumin, leading to premature payload release <Paper corpusId=\"18646779\" paperTitle=\"(Beerli et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31132425\" paperTitle=\"(Alley et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Site-Specific Conjugation Approaches\n\n### Disulfide Rebridging\nDisulfide rebridging has emerged as an alternative to traditional cysteine conjugation <Paper corpusId=\"220284434\" paperTitle=\"(Counsell et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy involves reduction of interchain disulfides followed by treatment with a bis-reactive linker that crosslinks the reactive thiols, reforming the covalent bridge between protein chains <Paper corpusId=\"7932736\" paperTitle=\"(Walsh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach can produce ADCs with more precise DARs while maintaining the structural integrity of the antibody. Various rebridging reagents have been developed, including bissulfones, next-generation maleimides, and pyridazinediones <Paper corpusId=\"220284434\" paperTitle=\"(Counsell et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n### Engineered Cysteine Residues\nTo achieve more controlled conjugation, cysteines can be engineered at specific positions in the antibody sequence. These engineered \"THIOMABs\" allow for site-selective conjugation, producing more homogeneous ADCs compared to traditional methods <Paper corpusId=\"208582853\" paperTitle=\"(Nilchan et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The advantage of this approach is the ability to place conjugation sites away from regions critical for antigen binding <Paper corpusId=\"12725280\" paperTitle=\"(Panowski et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n### Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation\nIncorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) with bioorthogonal functional groups represents one of the most precise conjugation strategies <Paper corpusId=\"257451749\" paperTitle=\"(Sapozhnikova et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This genetic engineering approach introduces amino acids with unique reactive groups, such as p-acetylphenylalanine, enabling highly specific conjugation through reactions not possible with natural amino acids <Paper corpusId=\"2784119\" paperTitle=\"(Jackson et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8693407\" paperTitle=\"(Axup et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. ADCs produced using UAAs have demonstrated superior in vitro stability and improved preclinical toxicology profiles compared to cysteine-conjugated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"2784119\" paperTitle=\"(Jackson et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n### Enzymatic Conjugation\nEnzymatic methods offer another site-specific approach for creating homogeneous ADCs. Microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) has been particularly useful for selective modification of glutamine residues <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between glutamine and a primary amine, allowing for precise payload attachment <Paper corpusId=\"206114232\" paperTitle=\"(Anami et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells (Govindan et al., 2012), Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course"

                            "Conjugation of various reagents to antibodies has long been an elegant way to combine the superior binding features of the antibody with other desired but non-natural functions. Applications range from labels for detection in different analytical assays to the creation of new drugs by conjugation to molecules which improves the pharmaceutical effect. In many of these applications, it has been proven advantageous to control both the site and the stoichiometry of the conjugation to achieve a homogeneous product with predictable, and often also improved, characteristics. For this purpose, many research groups have, during the latest decade, reported novel methods and techniques, based on small molecules, peptides, and proteins with inherent affinity for the antibody, for site-specific conjugation of antibodies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these methods and their applications and also describes a historical perspective of the field."

                            "The linker component of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) is a key feature in developing optimized therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated doses. For maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. In this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. The amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mAb carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. Here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether ADCs. One such ADC, 1F6-C4v2-bac-MMAF, which is directed against the CD70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (MMAF) and the mAb carrier (1F6-C4v2). There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. The mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-Michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. In summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting ADCs had similar tolerability and activity profiles."

[7][8][9][10] Site-selective disulfide rebridging has emerged as an alternative strategy towards the production of homogeneous ADCs. 11 This method involves reduction of the interchain disulfides, followed by treatment with a linker which crosslinks the reactive thiols from the reduced disulfides, thus reforming the covalent bridge between the protein chains. Significant progress has been made in recent years in the development of disulfide rebridging linkers, with the toolbox of available reagents now including bissulfones, 12 next generation maleimides, [13][14][15][16] and pyridazinediones.

                            "Recently, disulde-bridging linkers have emerged for ADC production: a bis-reactive linker moiety undergoes reaction with both thiol residues derived from a reduced cysteine disulde bond, leading to covalent re-bridging of the protein. Such linkers are capable of generating ADCs with more precise DAR and drug distribution as well as reforming covalent bonds between the antibody chains. Signicant progress has been made in the eld with this class of linker by Baker, Caddick and Chudasama and their co-workers, amongst others. [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] Despite these impressive advances, new methods are still required for the production of stable and homogeneous ADCs from nonengineered antibodies."

                            "Abstract Background While all clinically translated antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) contain a single-drug payload, most systemic cancer chemotherapies involve use of a combination of drugs. These regimens improve treatment outcomes and slow development of drug resistance. We here report the generation of an ADC with a dual-drug payload that combines two distinct mechanisms of action. Methods Virtual DNA crosslinking agent PNU-159682 and tubulin polymerization inhibitor monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) were conjugated to a HER2-targeting antibody via site-specific conjugation at engineered selenocysteine and cysteine residues (thio-selenomab). Results The dual-drug ADC showed selective and potent cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing cell lines and exhibited dual mechanisms of action consistent with the attached drugs. While PNU-159682 caused S-phase cell cycle arrest due to its DNA-damaging activity, MMAF simultaneously inhibited tubulin polymerization and caused G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest. Conclusion The thio-selenomab platform enables the assembly of dual-drug ADCs with two distinct mechanisms of action."

                            "Antibody therapeutics have revolutionized the treatment of cancer over the past two decades. Antibodies that specifically bind tumor surface antigens can be effective therapeutics; however, many unmodified antibodies lack therapeutic activity. These antibodies can instead be applied successfully as guided missiles to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs in the form of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). The success of ADCs is dependent on four factors\u2014target antigen, antibody, linker, and payload. The field has made great progress in these areas, marked by the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of two ADCs, brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u00ae) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla\u00ae). However, the therapeutic window for many ADCs that are currently in pre-clinical or clinical development remains narrow and further improvements may be required to enhance the therapeutic potential of these ADCs. Production of ADCs is an area where improvement is needed because current methods yield heterogeneous mixtures that may include 0\u20138 drug species per antibody molecule. Site-specific conjugation has been recently shown to eliminate heterogeneity, improve conjugate stability, and increase the therapeutic window. Here, we review and describe various site-specific conjugation strategies that are currently used for the production of ADCs, including use of engineered cysteine residues, unnatural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation through glycotransferases and transglutaminases. In addition, we also summarize differences among these methods and highlight critical considerations when building next-generation ADC therapeutics."

                            "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies designed to deliver a cytotoxic drug selectively to antigen expressing cells. Several components of an ADC including the selection of the antibody, the linker, the cytotoxic drug payload and the site of attachment used to attach the drug to the antibody are critical to the activity and development of the ADC. The cytotoxic drugs or payloads used to make ADCs are typically conjugated to the antibody through cysteine or lysine residues. This results in ADCs that have a heterogeneous number of drugs per antibody. The number of drugs per antibody commonly referred to as the drug to antibody ratio (DAR), can vary between 0 and 8 drugs for a IgG1 antibody. Antibodies with 0 drugs are ineffective and compete with the ADC for binding to the antigen expressing cells. Antibodies with 8 drugs per antibody have reduced in vivo stability, which may contribute to non target related toxicities. In these studies we incorporated a non-natural amino acid, para acetyl phenylalanine, at two unique sites within an antibody against Her2/neu. We covalently attached a cytotoxic drug to these sites to form an ADC which contains two drugs per antibody. We report the results from the first direct preclinical comparison of a site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADC and a cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADC. We report that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs have superior in vitro serum stability and preclinical toxicology profile in rats as compared to the cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADCs. We also demonstrate that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs maintain their in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy against Her2 expressing human tumor cell lines. Our data suggests that site specific non-natural amino acid ADCs may have a superior therapeutic window than cysteine conjugated ADCs."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) allow selective targeting of cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells presenting tumor-associated surface markers, thereby minimizing systemic toxicity. Traditionally, the drug is conjugated nonselectively to cysteine or lysine residues in the antibody. However, these strategies often lead to heterogeneous products, which make optimization of the biological, physical, and pharmacological properties of an ADC challenging. Here we demonstrate the use of genetically encoded unnatural amino acids with orthogonal chemical reactivity to synthesize homogeneous ADCs with precise control of conjugation site and stoichiometry. p-Acetylphenylalanine was site-specifically incorporated into an anti-Her2 antibody Fab fragment and full-length IgG in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells, respectively. The mutant protein was selectively and efficiently conjugated to an auristatin derivative through a stable oxime linkage. The resulting conjugates demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetics, potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against Her2+ cancer cells, and complete tumor regression in rodent xenograft treatment models. The synthesis and characterization of homogeneous ADCs with medicinal chemistry-like control over macromolecular structure should facilitate the optimization of ADCs for a host of therapeutic uses."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer, and various conjugation strategies and chemical linkers have been developed to efficiently construct ADCs. Despite previous extensive efforts for improving conjugation efficiency and ADC homogeneity, most ADC linkers developed to date load only single payloads. Branched linkers that can load multiple payload molecules have yet to be fully explored. It is logical to envisage that a multi-loading strategy allows for increase in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) with less chemical or enzymatic modification to the antibody structure compared to traditional linear linkers, leading to efficient ADC construction, minimal destabilization of the antibody structure, and enhanced ADC efficacy. Herein, we report that the branched linkers we designed can be quantitatively installed on an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase)-mediated conjugation without impairing its antigen binding affinity, enabling modular installation of payload molecules and construction of homogeneous ADCs with increased DARs (up to 8). An anti-HER2 antibody-monomethyl auristatin F conjugate constructed using our branched linkers showed greater in vitro cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines than that consisting of linear linkers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the branched linker-based payload delivery. Our finding demonstrates that enzymatic ADC construction using branched linkers is a promising strategy, which may lead to innovative cancer therapeutics."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) harness the highly specific targeting capabilities of an antibody to deliver a cytotoxic payload to specific cell types. They have garnered widespread interest in drug discovery, particularly in oncology, as discrimination between healthy and malignant tissues or cells can be achieved. Nine ADCs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 80 others are currently undergoing clinical investigations for a range of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Extensive research over the past decade has highlighted the critical nature of the linkage strategy adopted to attach the payload to the antibody. Whilst early generation ADCs were primarily synthesised as heterogeneous mixtures, these were found to have sub-optimal pharmacokinetics, stability, tolerability and/or efficacy. Efforts have now shifted towards generating homogeneous constructs with precise drug loading and predetermined, controlled sites of attachment. Homogeneous ADCs have repeatedly demonstrated superior overall pharmacological profiles compared to their heterogeneous counterparts. A wide range of methods have been developed in the pursuit of homogeneity, comprising chemical or enzymatic methods or a combination thereof to afford precise modification of specific amino acid or sugar residues. In this review, we discuss advances in chemical and enzymatic methods for site-specific antibody modification that result in the generation of homogeneous ADCs."

(Polson et al., 2009) Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). (Doronina et al., 2003) Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. (Doronina et al., 2003) Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. (Kovtun et al., 2006) DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63"

These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (Velden et al., 2001)(Kolfschoten et al., 2007). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003)(Erickson et al., 2006)Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "Valine-citrulline dipeptide has been used as a linker for ADCs such as DLYE5953A, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the lymphocyte antigen 6 complex (LY6E) conjugated to Monomethylauristatin (MMAE) under the auspices of Genentech and showed antitumor activity in patients with solid metastatic tumors (Tolaney et al., 2021).\n\nIn the last years, various reports related to multiloading linkers have proposed a novel methodology incorporating two payload molecules into single monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The main idea is to generate bi or tri-functionalized linkers, in which orthogonal reactions allow the incorporation of different payloads using covalent bonds (Levengood et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2018;Zhang L. et al., 2021;Yamazaki et al., 2021). Levengood et al. (2017) prepared a linker with sequential Cys residues with orthogonal protection to enable site-specific conjugation of each drug and conjugated to IgG1 through the reduced interchain disulfides of the antibody and stable maleimide linkage. In 2018, a novel heterotrifunctional linker was developed by Kumar et al. (2018), providing a flexible platform that allows the coupling of two different drugs via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and via oxime linkage using ketone as starting functional group, but also the conjugation to the antibody through cysteine-maleimide reaction."

This study characterized the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, potential biomarkers, and antitumor activity of DLYE5953A in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients and Methods: This was a phase I, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of DLYE5953A administered intravenously every 21 days (Q3W) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. Results: Sixty-eight patients received DLYE5953A (median, four cycles; range, 1\u201327). No dose-limiting toxicities were identified during dose escalation (0.2\u20132.4 mg/kg; n = 20). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 2.4 mg/kg Q3W was based on overall safety and tolerability. Dose-expansion cohorts for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (HER2-negative MBC; n = 23) and non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 25) patients were enrolled at the RP2D. Among patients receiving DLYE5953A 2.4 mg/kg (n = 55), the most common (\u226530%) related adverse events (AEs) included alopecia, fatigue, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. Grade \u22653 related AEs occurred in 14 of 55 (26%) patients, with neutropenia being the most common (13%). DLYE5953A demonstrated linear total antibody pharmacokinetics at doses of \u22650.8 mg/kg with low unconjugated monomethyl auristatin E levels in blood. Partial response was confirmed in eight of 68 (12%) patients, including three of 29 patients with MBC (10%) and five of 25 patients with NSCLC (20%) at the RP2D. Stable disease was the best response for 37 of 68 (54%) patients. Conclusions: DLYE5953A administered at 2.4 mg/kg has acceptable safety. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients with HER2-negative MBC and NSCLC supports further investigation of LY6E as a therapeutic target."

Finding linkers that both enhance circulatory stability and enable effective tumor payload release remains a challenge. The conventional valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker is associated with several inherent drawbacks, including hydrophobicity-induced aggregation, a limited drug\u2013antibody ratio (DAR), and premature payload release. This study introduces an exolinker approach, repositioning the cleavable peptide linker at the exo position of the p-aminobenzylcarbamate moiety, as an advancement over conventional linear linkers. This design, which incorporates hydrophilic glutamic acid, addresses the limitations of the Val-Cit platform and improves the ADC in vivo profiles."

(Staben et al., 2016) developed a chemoselective ligation approach that targets tertiary and heteroaryl amines coupled through a so-called ''traceless'' cleavable linker. After proteolytic cleavage of the linker, an adjacent self-immolating unit cyclizes upon itself and releases the payload in an unmodified form. An additional benefit of the ligation approach is that the quaternary amine produced from the reaction offers added solubility to the overall construct. This is a very desirable feature and is particularly useful when ligating hydrophobic payloads, such as those often found in ADCs. Kolakowski et al. (Kolakowski et al., 2016) created a self-immolating linker (methylene alkoxy carbamate [MAC]) that can attach to alcoholic payloads. The authors coupled the MAC unit with a b-glucuronidasepromoted release system, allowing for payload liberation upon ADC internalization. ADCs made using this linker system were stable over 7 days in mouse plasma and were highly efficacious in a mouse xenograft model."

A series of MAC \u03b2-glucuronide model constructs were prepared to evaluate stability and enzymatic release, and the results demonstrated high stability at physiological pH in a substitution-dependent manner. All the MAC model compounds efficiently released alcohol drug surrogates under the action of \u03b2-glucuronidase. To assess the MAC technology for ADCs, the potent microtubule-disrupting agent auristatin\u2005E (AE) was incorporated through the norephedrine alcohol. Conjugation of the MAC \u03b2-glucuronide AE drug linker to the anti-CD30 antibody cAC10, and an IgG control antibody, gave potent and immunologically specific activities in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo. These studies validate the MAC self-immolative unit for alcohol-containing payloads within ADCs, a class that has not been widely exploited."

                            "Abstract A strategy for the preparation of homogeneous antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) containing multiple payloads has been developed. This approach utilizes sequential unmasking of cysteine residues with orthogonal protection to enable site\u2010specific conjugation of each drug. In addition, because the approach utilizes conjugation to native antibody cysteine residues, it is widely applicable and enables high drug loading for improved ADC potency. To highlight the benefits of ADC dual drug delivery, this strategy was applied to the preparation of ADCs containing two classes of auristatin drug\u2010linkers that have differing physiochemical properties and exert complementary anti\u2010cancer activities. Dual\u2010auristatin ADCs imparted activity in cell line and xenograft models that are refractory to ADCs comprised of the individual auristatin components. This work presents a facile method for construction of potent dual\u2010drug ADCs and demonstrates how delivery of multiple cytotoxic warheads can lead to improved ADC activities. Lastly, we anticipate that the conditions utilized herein for orthogonal cysteine unmasking are not restricted to ADCs and can be broadly utilized for site\u2010specific protein modification."

Here we describe fundamental chemical studies that enable biological validation of this approach. Guided by rational design, including computational analysis, we characterize the impact of structural alterations on the cyanine uncaging reaction. A modest change to the ethylenediamine linker (N,N\u2032-dimethyl to N,N\u2032-diethyl) leads to a bathochromic shift in the absorbance maxima, while decreasing background hydrolysis. Building on these structure\u2013function relationship studies, we prepare antibody conjugates that uncage a derivative of duocarmycin, a potent cytotoxic natural product. The optimal conjugate, CyEt-Pan-Duo, undergoes small molecule release with 780 nm light, exhibits activity in the picomolar range, and demonstrates excellent light-to-dark selectivity. Mouse xenograft studies illustrate that the construct can be imaged in vivo prior to uncaging with an external laser source. Significant reduction in tumor burden is observed following a single dose of conjugate and near-IR light. These studies define key chemical principles that enable the identification of cyanine-based photocages with enhanced properties for in vivo drug delivery."

                "text": "\n## Thioether-Based Linkers\nThioether bonds form the foundation of many non-cleavable linker technologies due to their stability in physiological conditions. Maleimidocaproyl (mc) linkers are widely used with payloads like monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), creating stable conjugates that resist proteolytic cleavage. Oflazoglu et al. demonstrated that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates targeting CD70 effectively inhibited the growth of human carcinomas in both in vitro and in vivo models. <Paper corpusId=\"18457500\" paperTitle=\"(Oflazoglu et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper> The stability of these thioether bonds contributes significantly to reduced off-target toxicity and improved plasma half-life compared to cleavable alternatives. <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## MCC Linkers\nMaleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC) represents another important non-cleavable linker frequently paired with maytansinoid DM1 conjugates. These linkers require complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the active drug, which typically remains attached to an amino acid residue from the antibody. <Paper corpusId=\"17562819\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> This controlled release mechanism enhances the safety profile by preventing premature drug release in circulation. <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Self-Hydrolyzing Maleimide Linkers\nAn innovative advancement in non-cleavable linker technology involves self-hydrolyzing maleimide linkers. Lyon et al. developed maleimide linkers that catalyze their own thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis, effectively preventing drug loss and creating highly stable ADCs. <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> This self-hydrolysis mechanism addresses a key limitation of traditional maleimide chemistry by reducing the risk of retro-Michael reactions that can lead to premature payload release.\n\n## Oxime and Triazole Linkers\nMore recent developments in non-cleavable linker technology include oxime-type and triazole-type linkers. These chemistries have been incorporated into clinical candidates such as FS-1502, which employs geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment. <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229942582\" paperTitle=\"(Alas et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> These newer linker chemistries offer alternative conjugation strategies that may provide enhanced stability profiles while maintaining efficient payload delivery to target cells.\n\n## Drug Loading Optimization\nAn important consideration for non-cleavable linker technologies is the optimization of drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Research has demonstrated that higher drug loading does not always correlate with improved in vivo efficacy. For example, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) (with four MMAF molecules per antibody) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) (with eight MMAF molecules) when administered to tumor-bearing mice, despite the latter showing greater potency in vitro. <Paper corpusId=\"18457500\" paperTitle=\"(Oflazoglu et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper> This finding highlights the importance of balancing drug loading with pharmacokinetic properties when designing ADCs with non-cleavable linkers.\n\n## Integrated Linker Design Strategies\nThe development of non-cleavable linkers increasingly involves integrated design strategies that consider multiple parameters simultaneously. Su et al. explored key linker variables including conjugation chemistry (maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length, and steric hindrance to achieve an optimal balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency. These strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMAB\u2122 antibody-drug conjugates with different payloads. <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>",

Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development."

Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (Jf et al., 2009)."

While antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now clinically established for cancer therapy, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) are gaining recognition as a new modality for targeted drug delivery with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for cancer treatment. The linker in a drug conjugate plays a key role in the circulation time of the conjugate and release of the drug for full activity at the target site.

These technologies enable higher drug loading, improved pharmacokinetic properties, and enhanced selectivity for tumor environments. (14 sources)",
                "text": "\n## Multiloading Linker Technologies\nMultiloading linkers represent a significant advancement by enabling the attachment of multiple payloads to a single conjugation site. Kumar et al. developed heterobifunctional linkers that can attach two, three, or four drug molecules to a single cysteine, resulting in site-specific ADCs with drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) of four, six, or eight <Paper corpusId=\"221862427\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Yamazaki et al. created branched linkers that incorporate two distinct payloads using orthogonal click chemistry pairs, specifically azide-dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) and methyltetrazine-trans-cyclooctene (TCO) reactions <Paper corpusId=\"229549556\" paperTitle=\"(Yamazaki et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206114232\" paperTitle=\"(Anami et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. These dual-drug ADCs demonstrated greater treatment effects against heterogeneous tumors compared to co-administration of single-drug variants <Paper corpusId=\"229549556\" paperTitle=\"(Yamazaki et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLevengood et al. further refined this approach by developing linkers with sequential cysteine residues featuring orthogonal protection, enabling site-specific conjugation of each drug <Paper corpusId=\"6789271\" paperTitle=\"(Levengood et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy allowed the preparation of dual-auristatin ADCs that showed activity against tumor models resistant to single-component ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"6789271\" paperTitle=\"(Levengood et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Polymer-Modified Linkers\nRecent research has incorporated polymeric components into ADC linker structures to address challenges related to hydrophobicity, aggregation, and circulatory half-life <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These approaches typically employ amphiphilic, water-soluble synthetic polymers, with particular focus on polyalkylene oxides such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The incorporation of PEG chains can significantly improve the solubility and pharmacokinetic profile of ADCs containing hydrophobic payloads.\n\n## Enhanced Stability Linker Designs\nThe EVCit (glutamic acid-valine-citrulline) linker technology represents a significant advancement in ADC development, addressing stability issues while maintaining potency <Paper corpusId=\"49531486\" paperTitle=\"(Anami et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technology is compatible with various conjugation methods, including conventional approaches targeting lysine or cysteine residues, site-specific conjugations, and branched ADC linkers for heterologous payload loading <Paper corpusId=\"49531486\" paperTitle=\"(Anami et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6789271\" paperTitle=\"(Levengood et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdvances in self-hydrolyzing maleimide linkers have also contributed to improved ADC stability. These linkers catalyze their own thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis, preventing drug loss through retro-Michael reactions that can lead to premature payload release <Paper corpusId=\"240811966\" paperTitle=\"(Kang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Stimuli-Responsive Linker Systems\nNovel trigger mechanisms for controlled payload release include chemical triggers, near-infrared light-sensitive linkers, and tumor microenvironment-responsive systems <Paper corpusId=\"52927205\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Photocleavable linkers based on cyanine scaffolds allow visualization and targeted treatment of diseased tissue <Paper corpusId=\"13470913\" paperTitle=\"(Nani et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. These linkers can be activated using 780 nm light, exhibiting activity in the picomolar range with excellent light-to-dark selectivity <Paper corpusId=\"13470913\" paperTitle=\"(Nani et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBioorthogonal chemistry approaches have also been explored for selective cleavage of tumor-bound ADCs. The inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder pyridazine elimination reaction has been developed to enable precise control over drug release, expanding the scope to non-internalizing cancer targets <Paper corpusId=\"31628730\" paperTitle=\"(Rossin et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Integrated Linker Design Strategies\nThe development of advanced ADC linkers increasingly involves integrated design strategies that consider multiple parameters simultaneously <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Key linker variables include conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length, and steric hindrance, all of which significantly impact ADC stability in circulation and payload release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ideal linker must maintain stability in circulation while efficiently releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors <Paper corpusId=\"206539442\" paperTitle=\"(Srinivasarao et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity, highlighting the need for precise adjustment of linker parameters to achieve the desired therapeutic effect <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese novel and advanced linker approaches reflect the continued evolution of ADC technology toward more precise, stable, and effective therapeutic agents. As Tsuchikama notes, the clinical potential of branched ADC linkers remains an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop both branched linkers and efficient conjugation methods for constructing dual-loading ADCs with high homogeneity and enhanced potency <Paper corpusId=\"73450441\" paperTitle=\"(Tsuchikama, 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

However, certain applications require a high drug to antibody ratio (DAR), such as when low-potency payloads are used. Higher drug load can be achieved using classical cysteine conjugation methods, but these result in heterogeneity, suboptimal efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and validation of heterobifunctional linkers that can be used for the preparation of ADCs with a DAR of two, three and four in a site-specific manner per single cysteine conjugation site, resulting in site-specific ADCs with a DAR of four, six and eight. The designed linkers carry a sulfhydryl-specific iodoacetyl reactive group, and multiple cyclic diene moieties which can efficiently react with maleimide-carrying payloads through the Diels\u2013Alder reaction."

To enable assembly of dual-drug ADCs using this technology, we designed and synthesized new branched linkers bearing azide and methyltetrazine groups as orthogonal clickable handles ( Fig. 1 and see Supplementary Notes for chemical structure and synthesis details). We chose methyltetrazine-trans-cyclooctene (TCO) as the secondary click chemistry pair for the following reasons: (1) methyltetrazine-TCO cycloaddition does not cause cross conjugation between the azide-DBCO click chemistry pair; (Zardavas et al., 2015) methyltetrazine-TCO cycloaddition is a fast bioorthogonal reaction (k 2 = 820 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 29 with excellent biocompatibility; and (3) unlike unsubstituted tetrazine, methyltetrazine is stable enough to withstand degradation throughout the linker synthesis and ensure a long shelf life of the final products."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer, and various conjugation strategies and chemical linkers have been developed to efficiently construct ADCs. Despite previous extensive efforts for improving conjugation efficiency and ADC homogeneity, most ADC linkers developed to date load only single payloads. Branched linkers that can load multiple payload molecules have yet to be fully explored. It is logical to envisage that a multi-loading strategy allows for increase in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) with less chemical or enzymatic modification to the antibody structure compared to traditional linear linkers, leading to efficient ADC construction, minimal destabilization of the antibody structure, and enhanced ADC efficacy. Herein, we report that the branched linkers we designed can be quantitatively installed on an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase)-mediated conjugation without impairing its antigen binding affinity, enabling modular installation of payload molecules and construction of homogeneous ADCs with increased DARs (up to 8). An anti-HER2 antibody-monomethyl auristatin F conjugate constructed using our branched linkers showed greater in vitro cytotoxicity against HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines than that consisting of linear linkers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the branched linker-based payload delivery. Our finding demonstrates that enzymatic ADC construction using branched linkers is a promising strategy, which may lead to innovative cancer therapeutics."

                            "Abstract A strategy for the preparation of homogeneous antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) containing multiple payloads has been developed. This approach utilizes sequential unmasking of cysteine residues with orthogonal protection to enable site\u2010specific conjugation of each drug. In addition, because the approach utilizes conjugation to native antibody cysteine residues, it is widely applicable and enables high drug loading for improved ADC potency. To highlight the benefits of ADC dual drug delivery, this strategy was applied to the preparation of ADCs containing two classes of auristatin drug\u2010linkers that have differing physiochemical properties and exert complementary anti\u2010cancer activities. Dual\u2010auristatin ADCs imparted activity in cell line and xenograft models that are refractory to ADCs comprised of the individual auristatin components. This work presents a facile method for construction of potent dual\u2010drug ADCs and demonstrates how delivery of multiple cytotoxic warheads can lead to improved ADC activities. Lastly, we anticipate that the conditions utilized herein for orthogonal cysteine unmasking are not restricted to ADCs and can be broadly utilized for site\u2010specific protein modification."

                            "In summary, our findings support the conclusion that the EVCit linker technology is a significant contribution to efforts for developing next-generation ADCs and other drug conjugates. This technology will allow for flexible molecular design by minimizing challenges of linker instability and poor potency in preclinical studies. With further validation and optimization, this linker technology will benefit a diverse array of conjugation methods and linker systems developed to date, including conventional couplings at lysine or cysteine residues, site-specific conjugations at solvent accessible moieties (e.g., conjugation at the C-terminus of the antibody heavy chain) (Rabuka et al., 2012)(Beerli et al., 2015)(Drake et al., 2014) , and branched ADC linkers for heterologous payload loading (Maruani et al., 2015)(Levengood et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the long half-life of the acidic tripeptide linkers, as seen for EVCit and DVCit probes 1c, d, will be useful for constructing small molecule-based drug conjugates for targeted therapy (Srinivasarao et al., 2015)(Cazzamalli et al., 2017) ."

Here we describe fundamental chemical studies that enable biological validation of this approach. Guided by rational design, including computational analysis, we characterize the impact of structural alterations on the cyanine uncaging reaction. A modest change to the ethylenediamine linker (N,N\u2032-dimethyl to N,N\u2032-diethyl) leads to a bathochromic shift in the absorbance maxima, while decreasing background hydrolysis. Building on these structure\u2013function relationship studies, we prepare antibody conjugates that uncage a derivative of duocarmycin, a potent cytotoxic natural product. The optimal conjugate, CyEt-Pan-Duo, undergoes small molecule release with 780 nm light, exhibits activity in the picomolar range, and demonstrates excellent light-to-dark selectivity. Mouse xenograft studies illustrate that the construct can be imaged in vivo prior to uncaging with an external laser source. Significant reduction in tumor burden is observed following a single dose of conjugate and near-IR light. These studies define key chemical principles that enable the identification of cyanine-based photocages with enhanced properties for in vivo drug delivery."

                            "The development of ADCs has advanced substantially in the past decade, driven by improvements in payloads, linkers, and coupling techniques (Markham, 2020)(Su et al., 2021). Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156]."

                            "Safety and efficacy constitute the major criteria governing regulatory approval of any new drug. The best method to maximize safety and efficacy is to deliver a proven therapeutic agent with a targeting ligand that exhibits little affinity for healthy cells but high affinity for pathologic cells. The probability of regulatory approval can conceivably be further enhanced by exploiting the same targeting ligand, conjugated to an imaging agent, to select patients whose diseased tissues display sufficient targeted receptors for therapeutic efficacy. The focus of this Review is to summarize criteria that must be met during design of ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) to achieve the required therapeutic potency with minimal toxicity. Because most LTDs are composed of a targeting ligand (e.g., organic molecule, aptamer, protein scaffold, or antibody), spacer, cleavable linker, and therapeutic warhead, criteria for successful design of each component will be described. Moreover, because obstacles to successful drug design can differ among human pathologies, limitations to drug delivery imposed by the unique characteristics of different diseases will be considered. With the explosion of genomic and transcriptomic data providing an ever-expanding selection of disease-specific targets, and with tools for high-throughput chemistry offering an escalating diversity of warheads, opportunities for innovating safe and effective LTDs has never been greater."

                "text": "\nThe development of effective antibody-drug conjugates hinges on thoughtful linker design that addresses several critical considerations. The linker component must strike a delicate balance between maintaining stability in circulation and efficiently releasing cytotoxic payloads at the target site <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206539442\" paperTitle=\"(Srinivasarao et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This balance is particularly challenging as existing linker technologies often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity that compromises the therapeutic window <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Stability Considerations\n\nA primary design consideration for ADC linkers is stability during preparation, storage, and systemic circulation <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Premature payload release has proven problematic in clinical applications, as demonstrated by gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u00ae), where poor circulation stability of hydrazone linkers resulted in reduced clinical efficacy and safety <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address this issue, non-cleavable linkers have been developed to prevent premature release in circulation, relying instead on complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the drug with its conjugated amino acid <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Conjugation Site Selection\n\nThe conjugation site significantly influences ADC stability during circulation and overall pharmacological activity <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. With numerous site-specific conjugation methods now available, researchers can strategically select optimal attachment points on the antibody <Paper corpusId=\"228079722\" paperTitle=\"(Walsh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry remains popular due to its robustness and chemospecificity with either native or engineered cysteine residues <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Precise adjustment of these parameters is essential to achieve the desired balance between stability and payload release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Addressing Physicochemical Challenges\n\nADC linker design must address several physicochemical challenges, particularly hydrophobicity, aggregation, insufficient drug-loading, and reduced circulatory half-life <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Researchers have incorporated polymeric components within linker structures to overcome these challenges, focusing on amphiphilic, water-soluble synthetic polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Spacers are often essential extensions of the linker that prevent shielding of the antibody's active site while improving solubility properties of ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"1549757\" paperTitle=\"(Firer et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Release Mechanism Selection\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers represents a fundamental design consideration, driven by the proposed mechanism of action for each specific application <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cleavable linkers can be designed to respond to specific environmental factors such as the acidic environment of endosomes and lysosomes, proteases like cathepsin B, or reducing agents like glutathione <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases shed from tumor cell death <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207555725\" paperTitle=\"(Perrino et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, which resist proteolytic degradation and require complete antibody degradation, have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1 <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. These linkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream while forming an innocuous element after releasing the payload <Paper corpusId=\"271549527\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Bystander Effect Considerations\n\nAnother important design consideration is whether the ADC should promote bystander killing. Cleavable linkers can generate membrane-permeable neutral payloads capable of diffusing to neighboring cells, an important factor when targeting heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"271549527\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This property must be deliberately engineered into the linker design based on the target cancer type and heterogeneity.\n\n## Critical Selection Process\n\nThe selection of appropriate linkers has become increasingly critical after early clinical trial failures, leading to more restricted choices primarily focused on hydrazones, peptides, disulfides, and thioethers <Paper corpusId=\"55679231\" paperTitle=\"(Chauhan et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Novel approaches like branched hydrazone linkers that enable reduced antibody loading while maintaining cytotoxic activity represent ongoing efforts to optimize linker design <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAs the field advances, linker design continues to evolve with significant progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"251651157\" paperTitle=\"(Schwach et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "The development of ADCs has advanced substantially in the past decade, driven by improvements in payloads, linkers, and coupling techniques (Markham, 2020)(Su et al., 2021). Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156]."

                            "Safety and efficacy constitute the major criteria governing regulatory approval of any new drug. The best method to maximize safety and efficacy is to deliver a proven therapeutic agent with a targeting ligand that exhibits little affinity for healthy cells but high affinity for pathologic cells. The probability of regulatory approval can conceivably be further enhanced by exploiting the same targeting ligand, conjugated to an imaging agent, to select patients whose diseased tissues display sufficient targeted receptors for therapeutic efficacy. The focus of this Review is to summarize criteria that must be met during design of ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) to achieve the required therapeutic potency with minimal toxicity. Because most LTDs are composed of a targeting ligand (e.g., organic molecule, aptamer, protein scaffold, or antibody), spacer, cleavable linker, and therapeutic warhead, criteria for successful design of each component will be described. Moreover, because obstacles to successful drug design can differ among human pathologies, limitations to drug delivery imposed by the unique characteristics of different diseases will be considered. With the explosion of genomic and transcriptomic data providing an ever-expanding selection of disease-specific targets, and with tools for high-throughput chemistry offering an escalating diversity of warheads, opportunities for innovating safe and effective LTDs has never been greater."

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) harness the highly specific targeting capabilities of an antibody to deliver a cytotoxic payload to specific cell types. They have garnered widespread interest in drug discovery, particularly in oncology, as discrimination between healthy and malignant tissues or cells can be achieved. Nine ADCs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 80 others are currently undergoing clinical investigations for a range of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Extensive research over the past decade has highlighted the critical nature of the linkage strategy adopted to attach the payload to the antibody. Whilst early generation ADCs were primarily synthesised as heterogeneous mixtures, these were found to have sub-optimal pharmacokinetics, stability, tolerability and/or efficacy. Efforts have now shifted towards generating homogeneous constructs with precise drug loading and predetermined, controlled sites of attachment. Homogeneous ADCs have repeatedly demonstrated superior overall pharmacological profiles compared to their heterogeneous counterparts. A wide range of methods have been developed in the pursuit of homogeneity, comprising chemical or enzymatic methods or a combination thereof to afford precise modification of specific amino acid or sugar residues. In this review, we discuss advances in chemical and enzymatic methods for site-specific antibody modification that result in the generation of homogeneous ADCs."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs."

Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells (Govindan et al., 2012), Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course"

                            "There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice."

                            "It is generally thought that the anticancer efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) relies on their internalization by cancer cells. However, recent work on an ADC that targets fibronectin in the tumor microenvironment suggests this may not be necessary. The alternatively spliced extra domains A and B (EDA and EDB) of fibronectin offer appealing targets for ADC development, because the antigen is strongly expressed in many solid human tumors and nearly undetectable in normal tissues except for the female reproductive system. In this study, we describe the properties of a set of ADCs based on an antibody targeting the alternatively spliced EDA of fibronectin coupled to one of a set of potent cytotoxic drugs (DM1 or one of two duocarmycin derivatives). The DM1 conjugate SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 mediated potent antitumor activity in mice bearing DM1-sensitive F9 tumors but not DM1-insensitive CT26 tumors. Quantitative biodistribution studies and microscopic analyses confirmed a preferential accumulation of SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of tumors, similar to the pattern observed for unmodified antibody. Notably, we found that treatments were well tolerated at efficacious doses that were fully curative and compatible with pharmaceutical development. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept for curative ADC targeting the tumor microenvironment that do not rely upon antigen internalization."

Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect (Fu et al., 2022)(Dumontet et al., 2023)(Tarantino et al., 2023)(Drago et al., 2021)(Beck et al., 2017)(Matsumura et al., 1986)(Matsumura, 2014)(Joubert et al., 2020)(Riccardi et al., 2023)(Jin et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45]."

They play an instrumental role in the functioning of the ADCs and influencing their efficacy. Highly specific linkers are chemically prepared in order to make the ADCs functional, they are biodegradable and decide the release profile of the cytotoxic drug. Using the right kind of linker is very important in order to maintain the antibody-drug stability, and hence they are now being given more importance than earlier after showing failed performance in the previously performed clinical trials. The linkers are now chosen more critically and are thus being restricted to just a few choices namely hydrazones, peptides disulphides and thioethers."

                            "Not only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior (Lyon et al., 2015). Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes."
